# PipeTobaccoReviews

Contained within the 'Reviews' folder is all 476 submissions to r/pipetobacco that were flagged with the 'Review' flair along with their comments from the past
six years.

The SubmissionList.txt is a list of all 476 submission ID numbers, in case anyone wants them.

The impending doom of r/PipeTobacco led me to pretend I knew how to use python and write a simple script to scrape review data from the subreddit. This was
done mostly to help facilitate the migration of data from r/PipeTobacco to a new home, and was done without the consent of the moderators of that fine subreddit.
Hopefully, it helps someone out - there is a wealth of information there on these various blends, and would be a damn shame if it got spontaneously destroyed due
to enforcement of vague rules.

Each file in the 'Reviews' folder is listed as the submission number, followed by the author name, followed by the first 20 characters of the review title.

All work contained within each review is the original work of the respected author listed at the top of the file under the title. Please do not hesitate to 
contact me if I need to remove something.
