====================================
Alligator_Gar: My first thought is that's not the original stem. Not shocking if it's truly pushing 100 years old.
--
507snuff: I had the same thought, it both doesn't match the pipes width and op mentioned it's a bit loose.
--
linearone: If you had it in your hand you would see that the mortise has begun to deform over the years as its VERY thin walled in that area. I really think it has just started to spread out from having the stem shoved into it for a hundred years.  the stem matches in other areas just near the top it a bit wider. Who knows?
--
carnesy: Definitely a Frankenpipe.

====================================
VonSausage: That's the biggest draw hole I've ever seen. Crazy! Cool find.
--
linearone: It is right? It really smokes way way way too well. I'm just shocked by it. I cant clench it because it makes me nervous being a tad loose. I have to hold it but still. I LOVE this little pipe.  

I need a lightbox

VonSausage: I don't know if it's right but I love a big draw. 
--
507snuff: I've heard some bees wax can be used to get a pipe stem snug.
