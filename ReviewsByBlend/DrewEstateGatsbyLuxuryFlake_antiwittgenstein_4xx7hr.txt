Tobacco Review: Drew Estate Gatsby Luxury Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 74

**Blend Name:** Drew Estate Gatbsy Luxury Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** Sophisticated, but what does that mean?! This smoke is pleasantly sweet and mild with just the right mix of Cavendish and Sweet Virginia tobaccos. Ah, People will think you are some sort of aficionado that is what Sophisticated means…

**Leaf:** This is usually the most boring part of the tobacco but with this stuff it may be the most interesting. Basically the entire tin is one, maybe two very long, rather wide blond to brown flakes curled round the tin.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisin Bran

**Taste:** This is my second tango with this tobacco. About a year or so ago I opened this up excited and was quickly disappointed with the most bland, tasteless thing I have ever put in my pipe. I mean it made 1Q seem like Nightcap in comparison. Let’s see what a year did for this stuf…

Hay. Yep, we are back here again. Well wait there is a bit of woodsy note to it. There is a very subtle sweetness that would be otherwise drowned out, like unsweetened oatmeal. Now this is promising, a rising hard vinegar. Throw your caps boys we’ve done… well now it is gone and it is bake to haytown. There is an added note here, almost like very light fruit topping. It reminds me excessively of Erinmore but keyed way down, so I reckon that means Apricot, though once or twice it seemed like strawberries. The tang doesn’t come back. The flavors don’t build. It is subtle and plain all the way through.

**Nicotine:** 3-4 Pretty heavy for a straight VA flake

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Okay. Even with some drying time a bit hard to keep lit, but it always responds easily to the flame.
 
**Room Note:** Always smoked outside, but I smell like a coffin nailer.

**Age when smoked:** Fresh and then ~1 year

**Thoughts:** I had hoped this stuff would have improved after sitting untouched for a year, and while it is slightly better I have had other Virginias, namely McC 5100 and Newminster Superior Navy Flake go from plain to dynamic in as little as 5-6 months. I will jar some of this up and come back to it in the distant future, but I have little hope it will really alter. I think the chemistry of the blend just isn’t quite right for it to change, probably because of that Cavendish, but let’s see what 5 years can do.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Erinmore, Fresh Newminster Superior Flake, Fresh McC 5100, PS Navy Flake
 
**Summary:** A fairly bland hay-apricot but absolutely beautiful Virginia Flake.

**My Background:** **My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Shouting at the tele over a sport you don’t care about and don’t even really understand)

(++++) Great (Hearing the national anthems of countries you forgot existed)

(+++) Very good (The Olympic Anthem – thank you Mr. Williams)

(++) Good (18 hours a day of sport)

(+) I think like it (Crying. All the crying)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Olympic Commercial Tie ins)

(-) I think I dislike this (Rampant Jingoism)

(--)This is not for me (Doping Scandals)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Inspiration Porn)

(----)This is suffering (Refusing to stream events in the 21st century)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Bankrupting a new city or nation every four years )
====================================
mgvsquared: I think out of all of them, the two I liked unexpectedly were Heirloom Cherry and Grand Central Station (I think?) Strong but not overwhelming aromatics. While I liked the taste Central Park Stroll, it was so heavily cased in chocolate, or whatever, that it left my fingers brown. That kind of mars the experience for me. Gatsby was probably the best of all though. Light aro, fairly easy prep. It's just not THAT good.
--
====================================
PhilipJFry102: These ratings (not even the review, which is definitely great)are the best, thank you.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. Oftentimes it takes me time and research to write up the rankings, sometimes they take longer to write than the review itself. But 5 minutes with the tele on and I had it punched up, no revisions needed.
--
givemeyours0ul: I love when I stumble on your reviews on dar interwebs.
--
====================================
jmsiefer: I like Drew Estate.  In terms of their full pipe tobacco line, what is your favorite?
--
antiwittgenstein: This is my first and only. I have a tin of the Harvest on the Hudson which will probably enter the rotation in a month or so. Don't you worry, I will tell you what I think in excruciating detail.
--
TDKerabotsos: I generally steer clear of aros, but enjoy smoking HoH more than just about any other aromatic I've tried (Cult BRM and Sutliff Maple Street might be the other contenders). I find its tin note to be the best by a pretty wide margin -- really great granny smith apple aroma. I smoke it very dry, and find it to be a nice, light, almost "refreshing" VA. It makes for a good warm weather daytime smoke, particularly good in situations where you find yourself in the company of nonsmokers. 
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: I just popped my tin of this, literally in response to your review.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thoughts? I mean it is good for what it is, but what it is is not what I want, yet I can see those wanting a mild VA flake with a crazy presentation enjoying it.
--
givemeyours0ul: Presentation was interesting, I just have a kinda brick thing in there, but it flaked off easily. I pulled it apart and let it dry till it was almost crispy, I'll try it moister next time.  

Flavor was unremarkable, my palate isn't as developed as yours but I got very little from this. Very mellow, very unassuming. I smelled the (apricot) topping but didn't taste it. It did burn to the bottom with no issue. Not worth $5/tin.  

I'll rate this -  Rampant Jingoism.
--
antiwittgenstein: Hahahaha! Thanks for playing along. Yeah, not my thing. Maybe good to keep around to lighten up a too intense blend? Its what I do with Prince Albert, except I actually quite like Prince Albert - but it is $3.50 a pouch and doesn't claim to be for Sophisticates or whatever.
--
====================================
crimsonrat: I was really looking forward to these when they first came out and was let down, as well. The flavor just never fully develops in the bowl no matter what it is smoked in. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Yeah I smoked this stuff in my VA Brigham Dublin which makes everything else sing. Shrug. After careful consideration, this is what they wanted when they made the stuff, it just isn't for us Blackwoods smokers.
--
crimsonrat: I'd even go for a Dunhill flake profile and would find it acceptable, but nothing.
--
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Love your reviews.
--
====================================
jmsiefer: Hahaha...   I'm a huge fan of Drew Estate's Acid Blonde and Juicy Lucy cigars, so I was just curious if they had anything similar to that.  I have the 7th Ave Blonde pipe tobacco, and it's okay, however I don't have quite the palette yet to discern its taste, nor am I nearly as articulate as you in describing it.  Certainly looking forward to seeing your review though!  

If there is one tobacco that is very sweet, and that you have enjoyed and could recommend, what would you suggest I might try next?  Thanks!
--
antiwittgenstein: There are two kinds of tobaccos that are very sweet, Virginia and Aromatics. Virginias are harder to get into, the mind doesn't immediately latch onto the sugars, but Comoy's Cask No. 4 is a sweet, simple one. For Aromatics there are a few that are very sweet, but there are also the performance issues, and many times they turn to cardboard halfway through the bowl. If I had to suggest just one, Sutliff Taste of Autumn, but it isn't just sugar, there are many much sweeter blends, but it is good tobacco, and the warm autumnal spices come out pretty nicely. If you want the sweetest, perhaps Captain Black Royal is about the sweetest I have yet had.
--
jmsiefer: Much appreciated!  Thank you for the notes!
--
givemeyours0ul: I got so much vanilla out of #4 I believe it's topped.
