**Blend Name:** McClelland Anniversary 2017

**Official Description:** "Originally a limited edition Virginia mixture released in 2002 in celebration of McClelland's twenty fifth anniversary; McClelland has decided to reintroduce its Anniversary blend in 2005 due to overwhelming demand. A fine Virginia mixture with just a pinch of Latakia to spice things up; this is an impeccable blend, sure to become a favorite." (credit: smokingpipes.com)    
 
**Leaf:** Red and brown virginia ribbons with a smattering of jet black latakia.

**Tin Aroma:** For the record, every time I smoke 5100 I say to myself "I wish this had a pinch of latakia in it." So I was quite excited to find that the tin note is very reminiscent of McClelland 5100 with a hearty pinch of latakia dropped in. Sweet, acidic, and slightly smokey.     

**Taste:** The blend starts out very red virginia dominant for me. Sweet, bready, and sour with the signature McClelland acidity (which I love). The latakia is condimental. Some puffs it's very forward, some puffs it's just lingering in the undertones. But it perfectly weaves in and out throughout to keep the smoke interesting and complex. Compared to the 2010 Anniversary release, I find this to be slightly more sour and tart. It could be the leaf or it could just be the younger age. I'm quite excited to crack another tin in 5 years or so.    

**Closing Thoughts:** Overall, this is an extremely satisfying smoke now. It scratches that itch when I'm not quite sure whether I want a virginia or an english. I'd say it's currently a 3 star blend (out of 4) but there's no doubt that with some age on it this will be a 4 star blend for me.

RustyShackleford09: Too bad for dark leaf

It could have been delicious

Bad latakia.

givemeyours0ul: There are enough straight VAs in the mclelland Sea. Between the CC, 40th, Mccranie's red ribbon/flake, Blackwoods, 5100, and on and on and on I think there are enough plenty of VAs, especially red VAs from MC.

Pipezilla: Latakia #1

freepancakesforall: What's your reaction to Dark Fired? I imagine it'd be also delicious to throw a pinch of ODF into 5100.

RustyShackleford09: I like the dark fired leaves. Just not latakia lol

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the review, pretty insightful. Did you ever have Sutliff Court of St. James? Could you make a comparison?

freepancakesforall: I wish I could but I've never tried it. It looks right up my alley based on the description, so I'm on the look-out now for a tin.
