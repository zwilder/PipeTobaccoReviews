Tobacco Review: Erinmore Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #50

**Blend Name:** Erinmore Flake

**Description on Tin:** Actually from the tin for once:

“The Leaf tobaccos for Erinmore are selected from only premium tobacco growing regions of the world. The blend consists of mature Virginia, mellow Burley and sweet dark air cured tobaccos. It is pressed into caks, aged, and cut into slices providing a mellow and cool smike[sic] with a flowery and fruity note.”
 
**Leaf:** Very dark neatly cut flakes. Maybe the prettiest flake I have yet seen. 
 
**Tin Aroma:** Juicy fruit. Hay. Tropical fruits. Peaches. Anise.
 
**Taste:** Sweet and vaguely fruity. A bit of vinegar and citrus bite, with a white pepper undercurrent. A mellow nuttiness. Now they combine fruit, then tang, then mellow aftertaste. The taste is a bit confused and muddled, or maybe just confusing, as a high fruity note drops into a coffee-cocoa taste in the same puff. Growing earthy and more peppery, moving into cigar territory, or at least, brown bogie. The fruit note is hard to place. Someone just the other day said apricot. That is close, peaches, nectarine, definitely a stone fruit essence is there, but the topping only comes at the beginning of the draw. Some more classic Virginia plummy notes appear, mixing well with the burley nuttiness. I am surprised there aren’t more Virginia-Burley flakes on the market, there is *that* one of course, but it is so rare it might as well not exist. It is a pleasing combination. Settles down into itself, with the topping coming back every few puffs. You know, it is rather apricotty. Towards the end the Virginia gives up and it is just nutty burley and the fruity casing hanging in there.

**Nicotine:** Can be rather stout.

**Smokability:** Is dryer than many flakes, but it still needs more time than a ribbon to perform properly, say 30-120 minutes. Properly dried it smokes incredibly well leaving minimal dottle. No bite or burley mouth either.
 
**Room Note:** Toasty, a bit of woodsmoke. Nothing fruity or aromatic about it.

**Thoughts:** Another solid Type II aromatic: good tobacco with a persistent casing. See Firedance Flake. However, Erinmore puts the tobacco much more forward, with the casing coming off as condiment. Firedance tastes like berries with every draw. With this one you will see the unknown mélange of fruit fade and return throughout the bowl. The Virginia and Burley are so well done and pronounced I usually grab this when I want a stouter Va Flake. I smoke this in my Va pipes and have yet to notice a ghost. So if you are aromatic adverse, don’t be afraid of this one.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Firedance Flake, Carter Hall

**Summary:** A powerful Virginia Burley Flake with a pronounced mystery fruit casing.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** +++

====================================
Eighchops: Nailed it!  I must admit I am a touch concerned by your marmalade hatred though.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I like marmalade - the candy like American style. I've tried the British stuff a few times and it is like eating aspirin, all I get is pith bitterness.

None: I'm in the erinmore haters camp as well.  Tastes of apricot and coconut to me.  I hate apricot ordinarily.

====================================
Comintern: Thanks for the review. Sounds quite nice, I'm a big fan of virginia burley or virginia kentucky, or virginia perique. Anything with virginia and something else.
--
====================================
LegesAequitas: Sounds good. I just had some Fire Dance last night and I've been warming up to it a good bit recently as I've really disliked most aromatics in the past. I think your review has tipped the scales in favor of me getting some Erinmore Flake at some point soon so I appreciate your assessment. I must say, however, that I am currently living in the UK and really love British marmalade, I'm all about the texture and the taste of bitter peel.

====================================
JManSenior918: Love Erinmore flake, it was the first pipe tobacco I ever tried because it was recommended to me by the tobacconist when I bought my pipe. It changes drastically too the more it dries out. I had a tin that sat closed, but unsealed for a month or two and when I came back to it, it was like a completely different tobacco. 

Great review!

pixeechick: Thanks for yet another detailed, considered and informative review. Now to work on your issues with fruit preserves. Cherry pie filling? Dear god. You need some home-baked goodness, friend.

Here's to another 50 reviews!

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I had to make things fair and only list overly processed things - which when I started the list I realize how much fake fruit is in my life. 

My favorite fruity pastry is homemade apple pie - and hey it is just about apple pie season. 

And yeah, I am surprised I am able to have 50 reviews up so fast. They have been a kick to write. I appreciate the encouragement for you and all of /r/PipeTobacco.
