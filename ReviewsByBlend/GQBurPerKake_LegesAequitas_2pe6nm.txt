Review: BurPer Kake by GQ Tobaccos

**Blend Name**: BurPer Kake

**Description on Tin**: There is no tin, but I have a description from [gqtobaccos.com](http://www.gqtobaccos.com/pipe-tobaccos/house-hand-boutique-blended/gq-blends-burper-kake/) which is a bit lengthy, but here it is: Our first “Kake” tobacco, made using some of the strongest pipe tobaccos we can find. The choice leaves are moistened using distilled water and cold pressed for over 10 days, to create a form of plug. Due to the crazy taxation and restrictions on tobaccos, we can only obtain pre-cut leaf. So all of our Kakes are made using course cut tobaccos, the beauty is in a plug that needs no cutting, just a light rub before use. Our BurPer (Burley & Perique) Kake is made from a heavy base of strong savoury new world Burley. A touch of gold and mahogany Virginias to add a little nutty and sweet tinge. Then comes the Perique and in GQ Blends Traditions, over 25% is made use of. The resulting tobacco is very strong and spicy, with underlying vinegar-like flavour. As the blends stands it’s a little too dry and spicy so a maple topping is added to some of the gold leaf Virginias. 

The resulting tobacco is a tale of two halves; at the start it’s spicy and sweet; but once the smoker is half way through the bowl the sweetness fades and the full power of the Burley and Perique really come through. Not a blend, we suggest, to anyone who enjoys mild/medium sweet blends; think of a dry sherry mixed with cask strength whisky. A “Perique Powerhouse”, forget VaPer (Virginia & Perique) and welcome the complex flavours of our first BurPer blend.

**Leaf**: Burley and perique mostly. There is a little bit of mahogany Virginia and some golden Virginia that is lightly cased with maple. It's pressed into a crumble cake that comes apart very easily. It's not super moist like other crumble cakes or flakes I've come across. It's overwhelmingly brown, but with flecks and patches of lighter, yellowish hues.

**Tin Aroma**: This comes from a 10g sample in a plastic bag. It smells very deep, earthy, and bread-like with a nutty sweet smell. There is supposed to be a light maple casing on the golden Virginia leaf but I don't pick that up much, if at all in the aroma. It may be adding something to the sweet smell I'm getting.

**Taste**: This is an odd, multi-layered blend. Starting up the bowl I noticed that this didn't taste exactly like any pipe tobacco I've tried before. It was super dry (not sweet) tasting and I would say the flavor is somewhat reminiscent of a cigar despite there being no cigar leaf in this. The perique was very present at this point so it was spicy and nutty. At this point it was fairly strong tasting and there were some powerful flavors. As the bowl burned lower the slight cigar-like flavor disappeared but the perique remained and it became a bit sweeter and earthy, like a forest after a good spring rain. In that sense it was kind of woody tasting, but not smoky; at this point it tastes a bit like an unpeated single malt whisky, perhaps like Tobermory 10 (spicy, sweet, and deep). The bottom third of the bowl was my favorite part, probably because it took on a flavor I never expected. It retained a bit of sweetness, but less than before, and became extremely pleasant on the tongue. The smoke became rather creamy and the taste started to turn to mint and anise. Yes, the perique spice was still there and tingled the tongue a bit, but the smoke became rather refreshing. It was a great finish because I'm so fond of anise and licorice.

**Smokability**: I rubbed out the cake by first pulling the layers apart until I had a number of little thin flakes and then ripping those apart until I had both some little cube cut-like pieces and then your usual ribbons and small threads. I put the cube cut pieces down toward the bottom and middle and stacked the smaller cut bits at the top. This tobacco takes to a flame better than any other I've smoked. There was no need to dry it out and no problems keeping this lit. I smoked it in a little paneled Neerup that I got from /u/federalmng and this was my first time smoking it; it's an excellent smoking little pipe.

**Room Note**: Extremely pleasant at least for me. It reminds me of the tin note, kind of sweet, bready, and earthy.

**Thoughts**: My thoughts are pleasant. It's complex blend and I'm not sure if everyone will have the same experiences I've had with it. For example, Glynn Quelch (the blender) described it as starting sweet and ending dry, but I had the opposite experience. I'd recommend trying this to see what you think.

**Summary**: This is a bit of an odd blend and there's a lot going on, but extremely good. It may not be something I reach for all the time, but it's something I will definitely keep on hand. 

4-5/5

I have issues giving this a perfect score because it's so odd and have nothing really to compare it to so I'll give it a 4-5 because I can't make up my mind. It's certainly not your average smoke.

**My Background**: I've been smoking a pipe for about a year now. I enjoy all blends probably about equally although I do have times when I prefer English over Virginia and so forth, but that feeling passes. I have enjoyed some aromatics in the past, but I'm usually not fond of the vast majority of them.
