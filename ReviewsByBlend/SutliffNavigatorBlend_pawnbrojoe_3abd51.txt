Tobacco Review: Sutliff: Navigator Blend
By: pawnbrojoe

I recently order 3 tins of Sutliff Tobacco from Cigars International.  To begin with, I was pleased that my 1 week shipping arrived in just 2 days.  I was looking for a good black cavendish blend and came across the Stutliff Navigator Blend.  While I was ordering I got the Taste of Summer and Bosphorous Cruise on a whim.  I plan on reviewing these two later.

The Navigator blend is a mix of dark tobaccos.  Sutliff describes the blend as having oak and vanilla flavors.  Upon opening the can I am hit with a mix of oak and peat scents.  The vanilla is barely present. I am ok with this as overly sweet tobacco is not my thing.  

The moisture content was a little high and made the first bowl overly juicy.  After about a week in the tin the tobacco dried and became much better.  If I had to choose I would rather it be shipped too moist then too dry. 

Smoking the Navigator blend is very pleasurable.  The smoke is not to thick.  The mouth feel is velvety.  The oak flavor is very present while the vanilla flavor is more pronounced then the smell.  It is not overpowering and oak is still the main flavor profile.  

After sitting in the garden with a bowl of this blend the world just feel like a better place.  The Sutliff Navigator blend is high on my list of cavandish blends.  

Overall: 8.5/10

lunchboxweld: I haven't tried as many brands as I'd like but Sutliff is my favorite, their flavors are consistent and tasty.

tribial: Thanks for the review. I have a tin of these I need to open, but it is stuck behind a ton of already opened stuff!
