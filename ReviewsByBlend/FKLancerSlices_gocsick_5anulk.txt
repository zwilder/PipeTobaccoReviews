1st Tobacco Review: F&K Lancer Slices
By: gocsick
---
**Blend Name:** F&K Lancer Slices

**Description on Tin:** This almost black flake tobacco combines the best grades of naturally sweet Virginia and smoky Latakia, matured together under pressure. A wonderfully smooth and mild yet full-bodied mixture. Very reminiscent of the old Bengal Slices.

**Leaf:** Latakia and Virginia. Long and stringy broken flake.  Black and dark brown. Some pieces 6+ inches long. Thick cut. Looks and feels like beef jerky. 

**Tin Aroma:** Strong wood smoke, not pure campfire latakia. More like aromatic woods and peat. Notes of charred meat and spices. Very strong aroma from bulk tobacco. The only tobacco my wife has ever complained about when set out to dry (from a different room!).

**Taste:** Rich and deep flavor. Latakia leads. Not the incense like flavor of many latakia blends, but deep rich smoky pleasure. Virginias round out the palette. When puffed fast can approach latakia bomb status. Sipped slowly the virginias come into play adding a sweetness with slight citrus notes. Slight hints of exotic spices, freshly turned soil on retrohale. Flavor is consistent throughout the bowl. 

**Smokability:** Thick and rich, almost chewy smoke. Fantastic mouthfeel. Came in bulk at a very smokable moisture. Found better to rub out and let dry just a bit more. Takes a bit to get going, and a few relights along the way. Burns cool. Leaves a very fine ash. In a larger bowl I found that I need to tip it about 1/2 way through, otherwise the bottom of the bowl can be a bit challenging to relight. Mild in the nicotine department. 

**Room Note:** Only smoke outdoors on deck. Tonight it is warm enough to have the windows open, about 10 minutes into the bowl, my wife ran around the house closing windows.

**Thoughts:** I picked up an ounce on a whim and strong recommendation from a B&M while traveling for work. After 1 bowl immediately purchased another 4 ounces. I wasn't expecting to like this nearly as much as I did. I typically favor more oriental forward latakia blends. With it being only 2 components I expected it to be a little boring. It is not overly complex, but there is always something interesting on the tongue. Wouldn't smoke back to back. Clerk at B&M mentioned that he sometimes mixes into his Penzance to stretch it. Has a similar flavor profile but much less going on. Probably like eating at an Indian restaurant cooking for an American audience versus an Indian audience. Still really flavorful just not quite the same. Personally I find Penzance to have a bit to much going on (Matches860 called it a 3 ring circus), so this suits me fine.

**Recommend to:** Any latakia fan. Pirate Kake fans might be disappointed that it isn't a total lat bomb. 

Summary: A really nice balanced smoke, despite being very heavy on the latakia. High quality good tasting latakia and Virginia. Consistently interesting through the whole bowl. 

**My Background:** Cigarette smoke for 20 years. Quit 8 years ago and intermittently smoked a pipe or cigar. In the last year picked up the pipe much more and smoke about 4-5 bowls a week. Favor oriental forward english blends, with Va flakes and Va/pers to keep it interesting. 

edit: I wish I could catch spelling errors before I post.
====================================
carnesy: I got a lot of lemongrass from the VA's when I had my 1st bowl. Haven't been able to repeat that in the 2 or 3 bowls I've had since. That lemongrass was a really interesting dynamic when paired with the Latakia. Could definitely imagine old ceremonial fires and various other braziers smelling similar.
--
gocsick: Never had lemongrass peek through myself, but there are a few people on tobaccoreviews that mention tom-yum soup as a tasting note, lemongrass and ginger or galangal. That sounds like an awesome combination to me personally

====================================
Ifuckinglovepron: Interesting, I have never had this or Bengal slices, but I did recently purchase a tin of Fusiliers Ration that is also supposed to be like Bengal.

What strikes me is that you do not mention a sweet topping. Fusiliers has quite a strong vanilla and maybe rum?  Smells like vanilla extract, topping.  It is as far to aromatics as I would ever go, but it is not bad for an occasional smoke.

Is this tobacco like an unsweetened version?

givemeyours0ul: Fusiliers and Bengal both have a strong insense like topping. Fusiliers is mostly in the aroma but only a little in the flavor. Bengal tastes like it smells. Both are based on the old Bengal, the fusiliers by memory and the new Bengal by science. Same blender. People talk about getting that incense from lancer's, but I didn't in my sample, and you say you didn't either. I'm wondering if lancer's is not consistent batch to batch or not evenly topped or something. Even the description says "Reminiscent of the old Bengal Slices".
--
gocsick: I didn't get the incense flavor at all in mine. I really couldn't detect any flavored topping at all.
--
givemeyours0ul: That matches what I've got. I've just been confused by the comparison to Bengal made by the tin.
--
====================================
mugwump867: To me Lancers Slices is reminiscent of toasted marshmallows over a campfire -- sweet, smoky, and a bit charred but completely delicious.
--
====================================
MennoBrew92: A- this sounds like a really interesting smoke. I have never heard of anything like it. 

B - the added reactions of your wife were both humorous , and served as wise advice to fellow married men. 
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: Yeah, but matches also liked mixture 79.......  

Reminiscent of the old Bengal Slices...  

Is the old Bengal Slices nothing like the new Bengal Slices? The new stuff has an incredible incense-y aroma and flavor from topping, supposedly recreated from chemical analysis and memory of the old stuff.  I get none of that from Lancer Slices.   
Edit: Fusiliers ration, Russ's first Bengal Slices recreation, this time from memory, also has a strong incense-y aroma, but it doesn't translate into the flavor as much.  
Maybe I need to get a new sample of lancer's?
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I get the impression that Matches was an OTC and aromatic pipe smoker for most of his life and only ventured beyond that relatively recently.
--
gocsick: Can't compare with either Bengal Slices since I have never smoked either.

Re: Matches,  well you never agree with anyone all the time.

antiwittgenstein: Nice way to start your reviewing career, you did a good enough job to make me put this on my list. So thanks?
