Dunhill Nightcap review; my story of a perfect morning

Setting – I awoke WAY earlier than is necessary on weekend and could not fall back asleep. I decide to capitalize on this predicament and smoke some of my Nightcap, take some notes and write a review. Where I live it is quickly becoming winter, with this particular Sunday morning being no exception. It was approx 30 degrees with a brisk breeze. The one thing that struck me more than anything else is how unquestionably quiet it was. There was not a bird singing, animal stirring or light on as far as I could see, simply serene – the perfect setting for a smoke imo.  

  
Drink pairing – Cheap coffee with Irish cream; this pairing was not the best choice for this tobacco. A high quality black cup of coffee would have been much better. If this was an evening smoke I would have paired it with Laphroig’s quarter cask. I believe the extra oakiness of this particular scotch would go great with this tobacco.
Tin aroma – I opened the tin and a magnificent smell was immediately wafting into my nose. I went in for a proper sample of the aroma and was delighted. You can smell the latikia right in forefront with its smoky aroma, notes of leather, oak, peaty earthiness and hints of sweetness. You could also pick out the preique in this blend with some nice spice in the background. In my notes I describe the overall tin aroma as a perfectly charred dry rubbed pork roast and leather.   

  
Look – A blend of dark perfectly cut ribbon tobacco with black & dark brown tobacco dominating the tin and specs of lighter tobacco here and there. 
I packed this tobacco into my MM cob pipe that I typically use to try out new tobaccos; to this date it has not let me down and I know exactly what to expect when smoking something in it for the first time. To me the tobacco was at pretty much the perfect humidity right out of the tin. I packed a little tighter than usual but just by a hair.   
  
  
Initial light – it had volumes of velvety smoke, so creamy and thick for those first few puffs with some spiciness from the perique. That charred pork flavor came through with spice, oaky smokiness and sweetness like brown sugar. This flavored maintained through the first 1/3 of the smoke I loved the sweet oaky, leathery smokiness that was there.   
  
  
2nd third – The second third still had the smoky aspects but the sweetness has toned down a substantial amount. The smoke is now more tangy and spicy with a hint of acidity (in a good way). Too me this was the least exciting part of the smoke though still quite good.  
  
  

Final third – To me this part of the smoke was a powerhouse. The spice started to dominate my palate with the smokiness in the background. The sweet oaky part of the smoke had all but disappeared to me. For some I could see this part of the smoke being unpleasant as it was so spicy and tangy with a hint of smokiness. I have described the smokiness up until this point of an oaky smoke (think oak chip smoked ham); in the final third it is more of a spruce or juniper bow smoke.   
  
  
Overall thoughts – I loved this smoke, even first thing in the morning with a less than stellar pairing. I particularly enjoyed dynamic nature of this smoke which changed from moment to moment with it maturing into a rather exciting flavor. I must also add though that I LOVE perique, I have yet to meet a tobacco that has me questioning if there is such a thing as too much.  
   
  
TL,DR - Couldn't sleep, awesome smoke ensued.    
====================================
ragefather: Great review. Thanks for sharing.

For me, Nightcap sets the bar for an English tobacco. I have had others that are better than it, but I always come back to Nightcap.

ice_09: It is certainly going to be worked into my regular rotation. It really hit the spot for what I was in the mood for with just enough character to get me smoking every last bit of dottle!

====================================
Burnt_FaceMan: Nightcap is probably my favorite tobacco.  I love that stuff.
--
====================================
None: Great review, sometimes Nightcap makes my head swim but I do enjoy this lovely tobacco.

ice_09: I have heard this from a number of people and it caused me to add the Irish cream to my coffee for some sugar during the smoke. I think it help as I did not get kicked by the vitamin N.

farglesnuff: I haven't tried this yet and I've yet to break open my tin of this that's been sitting on my shelf for about a year now. I waiting to finish off my Squadron Leader or EMP first.

BenW0: Great review! Nightcap is an enigma to me. I don't particularly enjoy smoking it but when I do I crave it all night and the next day. I do like it better than FM though.

nicknack171: Great review, this really makes me look forward to smoking some English in the cold with some black coffee while I am home on break in a week. Happy smoking

====================================
iaaron02: Love me some nightcap. Sometimes it's a tad too strong for my weak stomach. Lots of nicotine....Boswell's northwoods is my go to English blend. Similar to night caps full bodied smoke with less of the head swim.

====================================
lwhjp: Yes! I thought I was crazy at first, but Nightcap really is like a roast dinner in a pipe. Lovely, lovely blend.

The only downside is that the nicotine forces me to have it in small doses. I guess that will go away once I build up some tolerance.
