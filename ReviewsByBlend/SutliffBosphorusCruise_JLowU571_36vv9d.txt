Review: Sutliff Bosphorus Cruise

Blend name: Bosphorus Cruise

Brand: Sutliff Private Stock

Tin Description: Mixture of Oriental, Latakia and Red Virginia

Appearance: Jet black and dark brown with a good amount of golden leaf.

Tin note: Latakia campfire notes, but sweeter than most English blends I've smoked, reminds me of sweet BBQ sauce. There's leather and oil notes in there too.

In the Bowl: This blend is pretty bone dry out of the tin and is pretty evenly cut so it's a dream to pack. On the char light I get nutty notes and with the relight and first puff there's great thick plumes of white smoke, thicker than most blends I've tried and a surprising level of sweetness in the flavour. In the first third then the Red Virginia is up in front with the sweet/nutty notes with the Latakia adding some earthy depth in the background. Toward to second third though, the sweetness fades and the Orientals take over. The taste and scent is akin to olive (or even motor?) oil with leather notes reminding me of my late grandfather's garage. Still the Latakia adds a solid foundation, keeping the blend meaty and rich. With the end of the bowl it's savoury Latakia all the way, like a well cooked steak without the condiments.

Strength: I'd give it a 3/5 for nicotine content. Like the bass player in a band; he may not be the star of the show, but you'll miss him if he's gone.

Conclusion: I picked this tin up in Anaheim while at a trade show since I was on the lookout for some blends I can't get here in Ireland. I'm glad I did since the marriage of sweet nutty-ness from the Virginia and oily Orientals is held together beautifully by the earthy Latakia undertones. In fact, the bass player analogy works for the Latakia too!

Rating: 8/10. Like The Terminator, it's no Star Wars (FM Cellar) but it's still bloody great.

My background: Started smoking cigars at age 16 via my father. Started on the pipe about 4 years ago. My top blends would be FM Cellar, Peterson Connoisseur's Choice and Solani Aged Burley.

Phaedrus_Schmaedrus: Oh man, I've just starting trying out non-aromatics in a serious way in the last couple months, and for the last couple days I've been trying out Bosphorous Cruise after getting it in a PTOTM box a couple months back. It's the first smoke that's felt like it's really clicked for me, where I could really pick out the flavors of the different tobaccos and appreciate how they worked together, and it's definitely becoming one of my favorites.

chewsyourownadv: If it happens that you really enjoyed the olive oil tint from the Orientals, look up Drama Reserve sometime. It's a whole different world when it's just the VAs and Drama playing together.

JLowU571: Looks like an interesting blend. The Grand Orientals series always fascinated me but ordering tobacco from the US is a balancing act. Have to keep it under 200g or Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will help itself to Â£50. Next time I'm placing an order I'll be sure to pick some up.

Chuzordie: here is an idea.. order alot of items that are on backorder so there shipped at different times and go thru customs seperately
--
JLowU571: That could be risky, I could get a whole ton of stuff through at once.

nstano: If you get the chance, Sutliff's Luxury Balkan Blend is also quite good. I found it to be more Oriental forward that Bosphorus Cruise.

antiwittgenstein: I really dig this tobacco - I am leaning towards more oriental-centric English (Balkan I guess) blends, mostly after how much I liked this one.It also really helped me improve my opinion of Sutliff. Nice review mate.

JLowU571: Thank you! It is a good blend, I had only ever heard good things about Molto Dolce before but so-so reviews of their other blends. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.
