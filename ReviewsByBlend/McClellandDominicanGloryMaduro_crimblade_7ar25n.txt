[Review] McClelland - Dominican Glory Maduro
By: crimblade
---
**Blend Name:** Dominican Glory Maduro

**Description on Tin:** A balanced blend of rich, dark Maduro Cigar Leaf and matured Red and Stoved Virginia tobaccos. The perfect Pipe Tobacco for the connoisseur of maduro cigars who enjoy pipes. Pressed into cakes and aged to develop characteristics and marry the flavors, then cut in flakes to be rubbed out to the smoker's personal preference.

**Leaf:** Cigar Leaf and Virginia. Broken flakes of dark brown with flecks of black.

**Tin Aroma:** Dark Fruit, definite McClelland ketchup when it was first popped.  

**Taste:** Sweet Red Virginias take the forefront on the first lighting. Behind it is a delightful tang and slight earthy flavor. All of these flavors have a nice creaminess that blends them nicely together. The flavors stay consistent throughout the bowl when kept lit. However if you let the bowl go out and rest for a few minutes you get a wonderful savory sweetness on lighting again. Occasionally there might be a slight spiciness but it is very subtle and blends nicely in the background.

**Smokability:** It's a broken flake so it's got a little more moisture than it needs for easy smoking. It's very easy to rub out, or cube cut as your preference may be. Drying time may vary depending on your environment. I've left this in the tin since popping it 3 months ago in order to allow it to slowly dry and it's only just starting to get to the point where it doesn't need much drying before smoking. My plan is to jar it once it hits a good moisture level but I'm starting to think I may just finish off the tin before that happens. 

**Room Note:** Very nice, no harshness from a cigar or the cigarette stink some blends can have. 

**Thoughts:** I do enjoy a cigar occasionally though I have no real expertise in the flavor profiles or what to expect from different leafs in a cigar. That being said I do enjoy them enough that cigar leaf blends for pipping have always intrigued me. So I picked this up on a whim and well couldn't really resist popping it as soon as I received it. I'm not sure what I was expecting, this is one I didn't read any reviews on prior to purchasing. I'm glad I did it really is a nice smoke. The biggest failing in this blend is that it's very easy to smoke. Crimblade you've gone daft, you might say, but hold that thought for a moment, it's so easy to smoke that it's very easy to have a fast cadence when puffing. This has the unfortunate side effect of causing the flavor to become rather boring, still tasty, but well, boring. You don't get any of the subtle flavor play that comes from sipping slowly or on the relights which are part of the delight of flavor this blend can have. I've found I enjoyed it most when I smoked it with plenty of time and a small bowl. It meant that I could consciously take my time with it which is really when the blend shines. I don't fully know what flavors the maduro leaf provides, I would hazard that some of that tang and the spice were it's contributions but I can't rightly say.

**Recommend to:** If you enjoy McClelland red Virginians you'll like this. Perhaps if you've always wanted to like Va/Pers but Perique just doesn't agree with you this could be a very nice alternative. 

**Summary:** It's a good easy smoke that can lose it's flavor when you smoke it too quickly because it plays nicely.

**Drink Pairings:**  A good Saison, the sour notes really complement the sweet tang. 

**Final Rating:** 3/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp, Quiet Nights, and Dark Plug.

Edit: I use a template, the easiest part is putting the description in for the blend I'm writing the review for, replacing the one before it, I failed.

*Further Disclaimer:* I was reviewing this blend anyways and his brilliant plan just gave me the push I needed to finish it up.

antiwittgenstein: First blood! Glad I could push you over the edge.

Have you had any other cigar blends? Care to make a comparison?

crimblade: This is actually the first cigar leaf blend I've tried, I've had such a good experience with it that the next time C&D bulks go on sale I'm going to pick up an once or two of their samplings.
