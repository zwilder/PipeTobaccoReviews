Tobacco Review: Haunted Bookshop
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 63

**Blend Name:** C&D Haunted Bookshop
 
**Description on Tin:** Haunted Bookshop is an unapologetically strong Burley-based blend that is slightly sweetened by the addition of red Virginia and spiced up and deepened by including the Cajun delicacy, Perique. This is a heady smoke with plenty of pepper.

**Leaf:** Short brown anonymous ribbon. As if it was trying to slip into the crowd, avoiding the cameras, just a few lucky breaks away from making it to freedom.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisins, black german bread.

**Taste:** Sweet and peppery, like a Vaper. Smooth and rich. Ah, this is flavor country. Sorry, I had to mock myself for using inane marketing speak. A light bready nuttiness. Cocoa and coffee notes. Another cigar like burley blend. There is just a faint sweetness here. Really, no cigar leaf? I usually donâ€™t like to look at the ingredients until the review is completed, but I am too curious. No, none. A bit of fruit from the Virginia or Perique, sort of plummy like FVF and its kin. Plummy flavors grow, mingling well with the bread and nuts. Wonderful coffee richness and depth. The spice is fairly randomly distributed, which is the principle, and really only flaw of this blend. However generally when it gets down here the spice has mingled or settled out. 

**Nicotine:** Yep. I feel the old tingle through my body after just a handful of puffs. This is an after dinner only kind of smoke for everyone but the hardiest of smokers. I am forced to spread out a single bowl over the course of an evening or even a day.

**Smokability:** Dry from the jar, smokes well even with sloppy loading. Puffs up quite a bit even on relights. I find it needs to be packed a bit tighter than I like to keep it going. No burley mouth to speak of.
 
**Room Note:** Smoky and warm. Not bad but you wonâ€™t attract compliments.

**Thoughts:** When I started my burley quest about a year ago I was looking for something rich and dark, complex and powerful. This is that tobacco. This is the last of the three standard bearers of C&Dâ€™s burley blends Iâ€™ve reviewed. Old Joe Krantz is quite good, but feels fairly rustic. Bigâ€™Nâ€™Burley has a bigger, bolder Burley taste, but the burley mouth was a bit off putting. But Haunted Bookshop? If it wasnâ€™t for the high level of Perique I would say this was perfect, however that might be to the taste of others. It does make me woozy, even with a heavy meal and an increased tolerance. Again that might be more to the taste of some of you.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Old Joe Krantz, Bigâ€™Nâ€™Burley, Brown Bogie
 
**Summary:** A spicy coffee and cocoa burley blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about two years ago. My current top three are: Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
p4ttythep3rf3ct: I just had a bowl of this three days ago. I am not fond of it.  I think burley turns me off.  /shrug.


--
chewsyourownadv: How old is the tobacco? If it hasn't been at least 6 months since you bought it, jar it up and come back to it.
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: It was a friend's.  I'm pretty sure it was fairly new, within a month.  Also poorly kept.  Just hanging out, in a big freaking ziplock.
--
chewsyourownadv: Professor /u/hedonaut, C&D burley insider extraordinaire, put forth the idea a while back that these blends have a fairly alkaline burley. After about 6 months, it settles down and becomes a bit less reactive. My experience tends to agree. 
--
hedonaut: That's about the sum of it. Tagging /u/p4ttythep3rf3ct so they see this. If you go by a pile of freshly cured, dark cigar leaf aging, it reeks of ammonia. Something about these thick, beautiful, sun dappled plants means they have to stew a while to give up their rough edges. I know it's part of pipe smoking "wisdom" (that is to say the body of assertions and assumptions passed down without ever really being put to the test) that burleys don't age. Get yourself some Haunted Bookshop or Old Joe and set it down for a few years and tell me if you agree. 
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: Nabbed some Solani Aged Burley 656 solely because of this post.  It'll be months before I get to it, but thought you'd appreciate the sentiment. :)
--
hedonaut: Good man. It only gets better as it sits in the tin. 
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: No man here lol. In any case, looking forward to it ðŸ˜€
--
GoochMon: woMan
--
antiwittgenstein: Have you had a burley blend you like or have they all been disasters? I would say shelve it and see if you come back around next year.
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: I have some Peterson Irish Flake that I do not come back to and is aging away.  I think it is burley-forward.  I have had, and have, some Savinelli Doblone D'oro that has burley at least in it.  I dig that blend.  :)
--
antiwittgenstein: The Irish Flake scared me off too - tried it early on in my career. I still have a bit of it hanging around for when I feel brave again. This is not like that kind of smoke, more like Prince Albert with much more flavor and a mean right hook.
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: I just tried the Irish Flake again, 1 year of age, and it is better.  Though there is some Wintergreen taste that reminds me of dip and thus puts me right off.  After 1/3 a bowl that went largely away, it was a decent smoke.  I'll try again in a year or when I forget what it tastes like, whatever comes first.

====================================
raizel_234: Spot on review! I personally love this stuff.

Truth be told, these days it's OJK or Shandygaff as often as this, but great review! Anyone on here who knows me knows this is in my top tier.  That cigar note you describe is what dark burley really seems to be about. I find a lot of similarities to the burleys used by Gawith, Hoggarth, and Co., which suggest they're similar plants despite coming from opposite sides of the planet (our burleys are American grown). 

I'm actually really surprised by the packing comment. My typical method for any blend with a lot of cube cut burley (as well as rubbed out flakes and broken up crumble cakes) is a sort of modified codger scoop. I just fill the thing to the brim until the pipe looks like it needs a haircut (tiny pile of tobacco on top of the bowl) and mash it down with the ball of my thumb ala Frank-style. I find that pronounced expansion you see at the top of the bowl (mostly the cube-cut rocking out) packs the bowl for me as it burns. It sometimes needs an extra relight or two, but it smooths the blend out a lot and lets the perique sing. Believe it or not, this blend is actually well under 10% perique. I wonder if that spice is just the rough edges of the white burley. 
--
tribial: Now I need to revisit shandygaff. I let it languish in the closet after a bad experience early on in my piping. It tasted like a marlboro red then.
--
hedonaut: Pack loose, smoke slow. The burley and Turkish do really interesting things together once you get the right burn going. 
--
tribial: I remember purchasing it because it was mentioned it had a "ginger" flavor. Do you find this to be true? It's finally becoming tolerable outside again, I may have to take the advice tomorrow.
--
hedonaut: There's no topping or ginger sauce to speak of, however, the burley and Turkish mix in really strange ways. I've definitely gotten flavors from it that reminded me a lot of ginger, but it has to be smoked very carefully to get there. It's certainly one of the more difficult smokes I've enjoyed, but it's a very rewarding one. 
--
tribial: well I do love a challenge, even if I am often not up to it!
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! Actually as I've figured things out I use a similar packing style myself pretty often.

It really tastes like perique though, but I haven't had too many white burley heavy blends (too my knowledge). There is some Va in there, but not enough to really tame down the spicy stuff I think. But you should know better than anyone else here what goes into this blend, so I will differ to you.
--
hedonaut: Well I think, in a way, we're both right. If you top a steak with butter, the butter will add something to the steak but you won't be tasting it a whole lot. If you put butter on plain noodles, you'll taste the butter far more. I think the charm of Haunted Bookshop is presenting a strong, pure burley flavor with just enough adornment to balance and compliment without relegating the burley to the position of simply being a "base" or only there for body. As a result, the perique, which has a bold, strong flavor, can present itself far more clearly with just a small presence because the flavor of burley tends to be subtle. For comparison's sake, Old Joe has a LOT of perique in it. As such, there's a strong presence of red va to help tame the perique some so the dark and white burleys can shine through. I think you taste a lot more of what white burley has to offer (the subtler of the two) in HB than you do in Old Joe.

====================================
BWeice: I'm really glad you enjoyed it, You hit the nail on the head. I haven't had a pipe in about 2-3 months to be honest but I have jars laying around. One big ol' heaping of Haunted Bookshop and a hill of 3 Friars lay dormant waiting for the spring to hit. I can't wait to crack into them. Heres to more good smokes!
--
antiwittgenstein: Oeuf, my apologies for the torture. Lucky for you old Phil didn't see his shadow this year.
--
BWeice: Here on long island we got hit with about 3 snow storms since Phil didn't see his shadow... I'm just about ready to find him and skin him so I can make a nice leather wrap for one of my pipes haha.
--
antiwittgenstein: And the bad news is that Phil is right less than 50% of the time. So he deserves a good skinning.
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: Having pretty much, more or less, kinda, sorta, recovered from a sinus infection, I saw this post this morning and it sparked a hankering for OJK. Memory being what it is, I expected it to be much harsher than it actually was, especially since I haven't had a pipe in maybe 2 weeks. It was... really smooth. Rustic, as you described. Also, surprisingly good on the retrohale, providing a nice peppery sting and plenty of flavor. It kinda has me wanting to try Haunted Bookshop again.
--
antiwittgenstein: Glad to have you back among the smoking. I like all of em, but I seemed to like this one the best. 
--
====================================
tribial: what is Burley Mouth?

I love this tobacco, and coming from Cigarettes, and vaping the nicotine is A ok with me. ha
--
antiwittgenstein: It is a rather unpleasant harsh feeling in the back of the throat that stings like a sore throat or a rough shot of whisky, though unlike tongue bite it is momentary and usually settles down as you get into the bowl.
--
tribial: Thanks! I get that when I over retrohale in my sinuses.
--
====================================
Plutoniumaddict: This is an excellent review. I love Perique in my blends, so I'll definitely try this out. How STRONG would you say the nicotine is on this? Can you compare it to something so that I have a better idea, if you don't mind? 
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks pipemate. On the order of OJK, stronger than Nightcap, weaker than the Gawith and SG ropes. I really need to figure out some sort of scale to help people out when I do these reviews in the future.
--
Plutoniumaddict: That comparison is just fine. Thanks for the clarification, guy! 
--
====================================
None: Late to the party, but thanks for the review. This sounds exactly like a tobacco I would love. 
--
antiwittgenstein: It's never too late to talk tobacco. If you want a heavy and rich burley blend - which I do - you will certainly enjoy this one.
