Heart & Home - Black House REVIEW
By: ScotsmanPipes
---
First of all, whoever bought all of the Brown Irish X, I hope that wasn't because I was commenting about it and I really hope it wasn't because I said it was a great smoke.  

That said, I hate Black House by Russ.  It's terrible.  You wouldn't like it.  Don't waste you're money.  I just had some and trust me, it's not for you.  

I'll probably be doing you a favor by trying to buy as much as possible to make sure you don't have the misfortune of running across it by accident.

/s but seriously, it is fantastic.  One of my favorite drinks is a Lagavulin 16, a scotch that's peaty but smooth, and this is it's tobacco counterpart.  Like a bad song it got stuck in my head and I had to go back twice in one night.  

I'd give it a 9/10.
====================================
patdavid: Lagavulin? I guess you like some smoke to go with your pipe? (Also, whatâ€™re you doin in my liquor cabinet?)

ScotsmanPipes: You know me, just sitting around a campfire smoking pure latakia, and drinking some Lagavulin after a long hard day at the charcoal factory.

====================================
Heliumiami: So it's still possible to smoke and drink an ashtray at the same time.

====================================
Pandam: I love lagavulin 16 along with caol ila 12. Both have really balanced peaty notes with a nice sweetness! Just like my favorite English blends.

====================================
givemeyours0ul: I love the lagavulin 8. Get it if you can. 
--
ScotsmanPipes: I'll  try it!
