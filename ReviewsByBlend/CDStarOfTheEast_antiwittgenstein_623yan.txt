Tobacco Review: C&D Star of the East
By: antiwittgenstein
---
Review # 85

**Blend Name:** C&D Star of the East (ribbon)
 
**Description on Tin:** Starting with a base of 50% Latakia, with a generous portion of Turkish leaf, then sweetened with stoved red Virginia, Star of the East is a full bodied blend, as well as a long time favorite of Cornell and Diehl customers.

**Leaf:** Light and dark brown ribbon, fairly standard sizes, but with some chunks in there
 
**Tin Aroma:** Smoky with some sweetness underneath

**Age when smoked:**About 1 year

**Taste:** Gentle Latakia. It is woodsy, mostly oak, but some times has a pine edge. Creamy and elegant without being overpowering. There is a genuine smokiness here I don’t often get from Lat, which adds to the feeling of being in a wood paneled library with a wood fire burning away at one end. Then juiceville. A veritable Splashtown of orange and lemon flavors. These are about as deep and vibrant as I can recall tasting in anything, reminding me quite a bit of Ten to Midnight, Blackwoods, and Orlik Golden Sliced. Not overly vinegary, just the tingling of fresh orange juice and almost oversweet. Through the middle of the bowl the Latakia entirely disappears, taking on a more Virginia or citrusy Turkish tone. In the last third, these bright flavors disappear again, returning, in true sonata form, to the original passage. Creamy, rich Latakia, but yes, there is just a fading hint of orange about the flavor. It is quite akin to drinking Earl grey with plenty of cream. Delightful.

**Nicotine:** 3. Fairly light considering how full the Latakia flavors are.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** A bit touchy for C&D but maybe I’ve gotten too lazy with my packing.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside exclusively.

**Thoughts:** I don’t have one going yet, but I am putting this on my ‘Must read’ list for English smokers. The flavors are big and broad, the development is deftly done, and the nicotine isn’t too heavy for me to enjoy, even several hours after my last meal. 

It is strange to have this be the next English in rotation after [H&H Ten to Midnight]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/5jbevb/tobacco_review_hh_10_to_midnight/), a blend that long time readers know I particularly enjoyed – and which is now my public favorite of that genre – strange because they so incredibly similar. The H&H was a bit coarser, less refined, but with deeper oak notes. The citrusy middle also never was fully free of the smokiness, which I did enjoy, but I am astounded at how C&D was able to separate them almost entirely. If you enjoy one, you will enjoy the other. While it will take a return to Ten to Midnight to confirm this, I think I might like that one more, but Star of the East is a better tobacco, and one I think, for this particular variety of English, cannot be improved upon.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** H&H Ten to Midnight, H&H Cerberus
 
**Summary:** Divided like Gaul into 3 parts, Gentle Latakia, bursting with citrus, then with an even gentler creamy Latakia with a touch of oranges.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

ChefJohnboy: Great write up! It was on my must try list before. Now it will be on the next order. 

Do you know how it compares to PS Proper English? That is my real jam with all the oriental going on with the lakakia. 
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I don't think there is any real comparison with Proper English.  Both C&D and PS have their own characteristic flavor profiles and those flavor profiles are quite different.  If you like other C&D Englishes you'll certainly like this one.  Personally, I like them both.

As an aside, I don't agree with the 50% latakia figure -- either from how it looks or how it smokes.

antiwittgenstein: I've not had Proper English, so thanks for tagging in FFMcNoodles.

I agree with your last point. When I saw that I was afraid I would be heaving green all night, but it was really quite light in the Nicotine, and the Lat flavors were pretty subdued.

Cycleoflife: No Soul Train? 

Seriously though, great review as always. I've been wanting to try this blend ever since that C&D [Union Square](https://youtu.be/Tzb-Evz3Ju0) video came out about a year or two ago. Aaron Wilson, blender, says his favorite C&D tobacco is Star of the East. I don't know why I remembered that part of the video, I guess it just stood out to me and I believed him. I've wanted to try it ever since but haven't made it happen. After your glowing review, my interest has grown even more! Sounds divine.

SupraMario: Sweet another review!

I'm on board with this, I need to give it a shot now, as this stuff sounds great!

misterzipp0: What'd I say? Monorail!

What's it called? Monorail!

Another great review. I've got some I jarred up in August, might be time to see if it can sway me to the dark side.
