Review- Jake's Flake

/u/djscollin4 was kind enough to send me a huge sample of a wonderful looking plug of tobacco he had made. I had so much going on in my life that I just couldn't get to it in a timely manner and I hope this review isn't too late.
I smoke outside a great deal and was not able to tell a room note which I think would have added a great deal to this blend. It was a sticky brick and was far too wet to even attempt lighting it. It seemed to have the top layer falling off so I tried repressing it for about 20 hours in open air and this seemed to fix it. I was trying to preserve the plug int he fashion it was made. I sliced off a few thin strips but it didn't cut flakes, rather kind of made a wet, sticky mess that i needed a scissor to chop up. It had overall a sweet, molasses/possibly rum note to it. I had to let it air dry and 24 hours, chopped up on a napkin was just perfect. I feel that I may have lost some of the intended casing but it really did need 24 hours, even after 8 hours it was just wet. Once dry it lit like a champ and required no relights. It produced a fine white powdery ash. The first third of the bowl had that molasses taste and reminded me of the virginias that were used in /u/zapotecorum rust belt plug although they tasted much less raw, more refined like a tinned product would be. In the middle of the bowl I got sweet vinginia taste with citrus popping in on the occaisional breeze. All in all It tasted to me like what  text book VA should taste like. Not sour, not to bright, not smoky or stoved. This is the kind of Virginia I like to smoke if I am in the mood for one. The last third tasted rather plain, the bright notes gone and just a mild, pleasant, almost sweet smoke, then ash..
I would love to know what was in it and also advise possibly more pressing time. An extra day in a c clamp made all the difference. 
All In all a nice smoke! I look forward to finishing my brick. I am on bowl two now! 

*edit: I went back through my notes and saw that this blend has perique. I did not get that peppery flavor but It must be his judicious use of it in small quantities. I can see how it could be in there. 
Perique as a condiment is always interesting as it will add or amplify other flavors/ Sometimes its spicy (not this time) , sometimes its sour, sometimes its sweet/tart. Perhaps that fermenty/alcohol molasses smell I picked up was the perique and not an alcohol based casing? Only further testing will tell.
====================================
coldsolderjoint: That is interesting because my tin note was sweet and almost yeasty. Like pizza dough proofing. It was pretty noisy, but it's a plug right? I really enjoyed the smoke, but I definitely knew the perique was there, it was almost like a ying and yang. Very bright and citrusy virgina followed by the spicy kick of the perique. I really enjoyed the contrast. I still owe jake a proper review.

djscollin4: Awesome write up man, thanks for posting it!  This stuff was wet for sure.  I actually ended up cutting the rest of my Plug into flakes and let them dry some.  That flavor you were getting was definitely from the perique (no alcohol in this one).  This blend had red, bright leaf, and golden VAs all stoved and about 11% of C&Ds granulated perique.  I don't think I'm getting enough pressure out of the press that I made to get the perique to stick to the VAs like I was hoping.  I've got a few small jars of this set back for aging that I'll try periodically to see how it develops.  Thanks again!
