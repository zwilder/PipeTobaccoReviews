Capstan Original Navy Cut ‚Äì A Review
By: VilaFrancaWeimar
---
I remember, when searching for historically famous blends, to continuously encounter this flake. Some scholars say it was Tolkien‚Äôs favorite leaf, others say that it is merely his son‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what is factual about it is that Capstan Blue is one of the oldest pipe tobaccos in circulation! As it is very natural in the piping world, a nautical term re-emerges, giving the name to this important and old tobacco brand. What really surprises me with this flake is the ability to last, and in great health, to be consistent and to create a legacy that might last some more centuries. I wouldn‚Äôt call it unappreciated at all, but it seems to not be as fashionable nowadays as some other straight Virginias of its type. Whatever that reason may be, gentlemen, I can assure you this is not a tobacco to ignore. If you are interested in learning some of the history surrounding Capstan, please read an incredibly well written article by the Dutch pipe smoker, here is the link:

Capstan Original Navy Cut (let‚Äôs call it blue to make it simpler) is a straight Virginia flake, and a glorious one.

Before the smoke:

The tin is absolutely gorgeous. The smells didn‚Äôt wow me at first, but they grew on me. Classic Virginia hay, kind of ‚Äúgrassy‚Äù, but with a kind of strange acidic undertone that I cannot really describe (yes, I know I am a bad tobacco reviewer if I cannot describe it, but indulge me). It doesn‚Äôt really smell like it will be winning prizes for its natural sweetness. I guess it has to do to with the topping. 
 
Beginning of the smoke:

As most flakes, when I use the fold and stuff packing it is kind of hard to light, but apart for that it burns great. First puffs in and you realize it is a sweet Virginia bundle of compressed greatness, even if the smell didn‚Äôt convince me in a first approach.

During the smoke:

I noticed that it tastes really fresh, and even when I smoke it a bit faster, it is easy to get a cool smoke. It is sugary in a good and natural tasting way, but of course, not too much. It is a bit stronger than most Virginias I have encountered, but still not a heavy one whatsoever. Halfway into the bow it starts to get real creamy in the best way imaginable, after that, what I can only describe in a rather silly manner as unsalted butter (what a great surprise). This one is real fun, the type of tobacco you want to go out boating with. Also, didn‚Äôt get any bite, which is rare for Mac Baren produced tins.

After the smoke:

The room note isn‚Äôt for everyone, especially for non-smokers, I have been told. Beard note is light like any Virginia I have tried so far, and it dissipates quickly in the wind. This tobacco will not scorch your tongue or ruin your palate; it is very neutral in a positive way.

Overview:

I really wanted to say the following. Some people on the Internet seem to be convinced that some people like this tobacco because some kind of nostalgic fetishism, or because it is ‚Äúold timey‚Äù. This might be true for some cases, but I would say that old tobaccos get this type of nostalgic status because they are really good, and usually consistent, otherwise they would stop being bought. Dear reader, you really shouldn‚Äôt care for troll nay-sayers, and really do try it for yourself. Where I live it is cheaper than Sam Gawith FVF, available all around the world, and definitely deserves more than two reviews on this sub. Check it out if you haven‚Äôt already and see if it deserves its legendary status or not.

With that out of the way, all I can say about it is that it really beat my expectations. What a fun, sweet, fresh smoke. A fantastic and unique old classic!

Also wanted to ask u/antiwittgenstein , how do you get the time to read so many reviews? 

====================================
aelmer2821: Great review. This is now on my list to try. Also, my own classics list:

All Creatures Great and Small- James Herriot: This is the first non fiction series I read that I wasn't forced to with school. 

Mere Christianity- C.S. Lewis: Just a good overall read. 

War is a Racket- Smedley Butler: I think this should be required reading for any of my brethren in the Military. Written by ol' Gimlet Eye himself.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you, really apreciate your kind words and your classics list! Gonna check them out

====================================
givemeyours0ul: Good stuff, I have many tins, but it is in no way cheaper than FVF. $4 more than FVF on SP.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Well, it is ar least 3 euro cheaper where I am from. Sorry about the confusion, it is probably diferent in the states.
--
givemeyours0ul: That's very interesting, I would have thought there wouldn't be a price difference like that. I would say tarrifs but both manufacturers are in the Euro zone. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Right, well, britain not anymore.. I Just saw you have a discount right now in SP (14) and that it used to cost 20 dollars? Crazy, inside the EU its 11.25. Really on the cheap side.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: I edited the review as to not be incorrect, thank you for bringing it to my attention.
--
====================================
MarxIsMyDaddy69: The Ego and It‚Äôs Own has not gone unnoticed....down with spooks üëªüëªüëª.

====================================
Vendredi8: Absolutely one of my all time favorites good review! 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you sir! 
--
====================================
Poopsock_Piper: One of my favorites, but I just can't spend 15$ on a tin every time I want to smoke it. Kind of ridiculous.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Yes, it makes sense. I guess I am lucky when it comes to a cheaper acess to blue capstan. 
--
====================================
Currucho: Are you perhaps Spanish? Here in Spain, Capstan Blue is also cheap. And as nice as you so well reviewed it.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: No, but I am an Iberian brother. I just import everything from germany since what is available in the market here in Portugal is so terrible.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Well since I am reading this one 4 days late, I don't always have that much time. But I set aside some time almost every day to read most of /r/pipetobacco for that day. It is almost as relaxing as smoking itself. And now that I have something like a porch, sometimes I can do both at once.

Nice review. Have you had Dunhill Flake? Could you compare the two?
--
====================================
VilaFrancaWeimar: I actually cannot compare it to dunhill flake, because I never had it before... yes, heresy, I know. But to be honest, it is pretty different from most Virginias I have tried and stands alone mostly because of its casing. The tobaccos are obviously of great quality, but the casing isnt citrus-like like OGS or cocoa like Veermaster, and it is particularly hard to define
