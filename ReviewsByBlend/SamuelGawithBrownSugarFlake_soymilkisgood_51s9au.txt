====================================
Jaxx666: It was so difficult to keep lit that I let my tins go. That's my review. I think I burned out a full bic on this stuff. 
--
soymilkisgood: Did you /u/DryYourTobacco?
--
Jaxx666: Yea. I also tried microwaving it. Cube cutting. It was just an overall pain. That was my first Gawith blend and I've stayed away from them since. 
--
None: SG flakes take some getting used to, for sure
--
freepancakesforall: Sure do. My usual method is to break up a flake, let it sit, and then remember hours later that I'd started drying tobacco. Then it's good to go. 
--
None: I can't get a decent fold and stuff if I leave it out for more than 45 minutes here, but we have no humidity.  That's ok though, I like how it tastes wet better than crispy dry ... it takes some doing to get lit though.

====================================
Doc_Hooligan: I love it. It's an excellent Virginia with wonderful grassy hay notes, and just enough added sweetness to make it stand out above many other Virginias that I've tried. It's extremely moist in the tin, so it takes a few hours of drying time, but it's worth it if you have a little patience. I'm sad that it's no longer available in the US, but I might be willing to spring for a few tins from Denmark if I find myself with a little extra disposable income. Might have to see if I can find someone willing to go in on a large purchase together just to help offset the shipping costs. Guess I'll need to start paying attention to the exchange rates and buy when the Kroner is down against the dollar.

====================================
CWarriorX: My first impressions were... Meh...

Nothing too impressive but I figured I will hold onto it and give it another try with some age on it.
--
boomermax: Same here.  I suspect it needs age to reach its full potential 
--
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Anyone know where I can get some?
--
Doc_Hooligan: Unless someone who already has some is willing to work out a deal with you, I think the only way to get it is to order directly from Danish Pipe Club. 
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Gotcha. Well if anyone sees this and wants to swap some shoot me a PM. I've got plenty I could trade. 
--
givemeyours0ul: I gotta bsf you gotta SPC reserve?
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: I got nudies if you have SPC reserve! That's another one I would love to get my hands on. Sorry bud. 
--
givemeyours0ul: It was worth a shot.
--
sovietferret: I have some I'd be willing to part with on a trade. 
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: You stocked on OGS? I've got a couple ounces I could send your way?
--
====================================
butterspread: I like it much. Very nice and sweet Va blend. Grassy notes throughout the smoke. Room note is excellent too if you can smoke indoors. 
As with SG blends - dry the shit out of it. I rub my flakes out and leave them on a piece of paper for a full day or two. That does the trick with smokeability. If you can get it - get it.
--
====================================
Zapotecorum: If anyone has any to trade PM me, i'll make it worth your while. doesnt need to be alot, a half ounce would be more than enough for me to get a feel for it

====================================
VonSausage: It was ok. Not worth the hassle to get it in the US. There are many other tobaccos readily available that work just as well.
