Review a Day 12 (Vacation edition): Samuel Gawith Squadron Leader
By: physicsyakuza
---
So I'm out of town this week visiting my parents but that doesn't mean the reviews stop! Faithfully packed 6 pipe bowls worth of different blends into baggies, grabbed a couple of my most versatile pipes, and I'll sneak off for an hour or so to smoke them outside with my trusty computer. Here we go!

Blend Name: Samuel Gawith Squadron Leader

Tin description: Bright and Dark Virginias blended together with Latakia and Turkish leaf to make this a cool medium bodied smoke.

Appearance: Light brown and tan ribbons

Gravity packed in my Peterson Mark Twain pipe. 

Flavor: 
Initial: This blend has always embodied the balanced English blend for me. Nuttiness from the latakia, sweetness from the VA and that great oriental spice that I am personally a very big fan of. SL has always been a meat and potatoes blend in my opinion, although perhaps I'm jumping ahead to quickly to the thoughts sectionâ€¦ The VA's take a back seat on this one, definitely tie the blend together with a fain sweetness abounding. The orientals and latakia provide most of the flavor, but never does one win over the other. This is the german precision engineering of tobacco blends if you don't mind my hyperbole. 

Mid: Dry and leathery. This blend sneaks up on "chewy" territory in the mouthfeel department, but you really have to pay attention to notice it.

Final: This blend reminds me why I smoke. It's tobacco unlike any cigar or god forbid cigarette you'll ever have. It is distinctly pipe. Nutty, slight carmel with hints of salt.

Thoughts: I LOVE this blend, and I can see why it was presented to me 6 or 7 years ago as THE starter english blend. Truth be told, if you started with SL, you may not ever want to keep searching, this tobacco does it all. I do tend to pack this a little wet so it needs some relights, but user error is no reason to knock this blend. If you haven't had SL yet, kick yourself, then track some down. If worse comes to worse, I will GIVE you some. 


====================================
AnotherIvan: This has got me all excited.
I bought a tin of SL which arrived yesterday, now I'm even more excited about smoking it!

However, I consider myself a beginner smoker, and am worried it's going to take me a number of bowls to 'learn' all the different flavours that can be had during a smoke.
Good review, thanks.

xTastlesSWateRx: Not sure anybody has told you yet, but dry it out first, it tends to come very wet in the tin. I hated my SL at first,dried it out, and it has become a favorite.
--
AnotherIvan: Thanks for the tip, I'll be sure to try drying it!

====================================
grabageman: Wife got me a pound of SL for Christmas.  Had it divided up into 5 or 6 jars.  Cracking open the one i'm on now was pretty amazing.  Had a pretty good vaccuum so it sat enough to age a bit.  Really brought out those fleeting flavors I've always chased.
--
physicsyakuza: I'm not sure I can imagine a whole pound of SL. That would be a tobacco filled throw pillow!

====================================
Scrubzyy: Great reviews! And i'd love to take up on your offer (if you were serious that is) i have yet to try this blend and trust me i've been looking. I have to offer some dunhill 965 and orlik golden sliced if you'd be interested in trading.
--
physicsyakuza: Most definitely serious. I can always use some golden sliced. Send me a PM and we can work out the details. I'm thinking a quarter ounce for a quarter ounce.
