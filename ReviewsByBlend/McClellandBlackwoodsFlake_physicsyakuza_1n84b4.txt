Review-A-... err...Month 25: McClelland Blackwoods Flake
By: physicsyakuza

Greetings fellow pipers, it's been awhile! Writing three papers for graduate school and picking up a part-time job (at a tobacco shop no less! Shameless plug: Check out Smoker's Haven for a less picked over selection, especially tobacco.) makes for lots of time to smoke but no time to review! Hopefully things calm down a bit but Review a day may become review-every-other-day for the foreseeable future. But onto the review!

Blend Name: McClelland Personal Reserve: Blackwoods Flake

Tin Description: The characteristic, natural sweetness of mellow, Red Virginias mingles inextricably with the richness and inherently spicy aroma of Black Stoved Virginias in this doubly aged red and black all-Virginia cake mixture. An artistic achievement in tobaccos for the pipe, this beautiful mottled flake is incomparable in smoothness, balance and refinement.

Appearance: Dark oily thick broken flakes. 

Aroma: mmmm, McClelland ketchup. 

Lightly rubbed and packed into my Savinelli Da Vinci Autoritratto. Forgot to write down the tin date, but it was purchased June 2012 from Iwan Ries.

Flavor:
Initial: Nice and earthy. Tastes like that great smell you get when you walk into a smoke shop. Rich, but not overly cloying. Mellow dried fruit tones, like raisins without the sweetness. Almost reminds me of a burley blend. Very small hints of spice, like fruit cake. 

Mid: Rich berry flavors (almost like super mellow bubble gum) with a leathery grass-like undertone. Quite pleasant and very straight forward. 

Final: Leather, citrus and hay really coming out. Chewy, but certainly not what I would call full bodied.

Thoughts: You can't really do too badly when it comes to aged Virginias. Impatient and want to skip the cellaring time a bit? Try Blackwoods Flake! Then put it in a cellar and forget about it for a year for an even better smoke.

jarvis400: Many thanks for the great review.

I need to order some of these tinned McC virginias. Years ago I tried some of their bulks and was put off by the humectants and the BBQ-sauce smell. I have enjoyed some of their latakia blends, though.
