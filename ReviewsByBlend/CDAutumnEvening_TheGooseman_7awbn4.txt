C&D Autumn Evening Review
By: TheGooseman_
---
Description On Tin: None, bought bulk.

Leaf: Red Virginia, Cavendish. Topped with a maple/vanilla coating. The cut is very fine, think cigarette tobacco. I found many stem pieces, not good so I've been told. 

Aroma From Bag / In Jar: Maple, lots of Maple.

Taste: The first few puffs are good, but if you smoke any hotter than bordering on your pipe going out and staying lit, it will taste ashy. You really need to take it slow with this one to enjoy it, but if you manage to do it, it's pretty good. 

Smokability: Easy to light, just puff slow and take your time.

Room Note: This is probably where this blend falls short. I must agree with another review of this blend I saw, it's like going to the smoking section of an IHOP. Stale cigarettes and maple, but if you don't smoke inside, don't worry about it.

My personal thoughts are maybe get an ounce of it and try it out. It isn't my favorite blend by any means, but it is okay. I haven't tried many blends, so I'm sure there are better ones than this. I definitely would not recommend this to a new piper, it will put you off to pipes if you smoke it too fast. If you like Maple, try it, if not stay away from this blend. It is basically all maple with subtle vanilla flavors. 

Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ out of ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

(First Tobacco review, but I hope it is helpful. I would love to hear your thoughts!)
