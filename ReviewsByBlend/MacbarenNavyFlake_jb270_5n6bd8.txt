My first attempt at a review(Macbaren Navy Flake) and some advice from a beginner for other beginners

So I've been smoking a pipe for 3 or 4 months at this point. After dabbling with aromatics and being greeted with tongue bite and flavorless smoke that was more like hot air I picked up an English blend. After that I assumed that I would only like English blends and stuck to those exclusively, the only exception being Haddos delight. That is until now, enter Mac Baren Navy Flake. As my palate is still developing my tasting notes may not be totally complete but I'll do my best. 

Presentation: Very good. The tin design is simple, but elegant. Once opened, the flakes themselves are wrapped in a beautiful gold colored foil, with the company website and "Mac Baren Flake" embossed on it. 

Price: This is the priciest tin I have purchased so far, $24 at my local B&M for 3.5oz/100g. It does however contain 3.5 ounces of tobacco compared to the 2oz tins I have bought previously. It comes in at just under $7 an ounce, which is comparable to the other 2oz tins I have purchased. It can be purchased online for $5-6 cheaper, but I don't mind supporting a local small business(also in a pretty rural area). 

Description on tin: Carefully selected burley, Virginia, and the original Mac Baren Cavendish have been pressed and stored for weeks before cutting into slices. The pressing process secures a slow and cool burning, which gives the ultimate smoking pleasure. 

Tin Note: very sweet and pleasant, I could sniff this for hours. Molasses and dried fruits(plum?). I also get subtle notes of hay/straw. As far as I know this particular blend is not topped with rum, and it does not smell as if it is. I think it is topped with Mac Baren's maple sugar but if anyone knows otherwise feel free to correct me. 

Flavor: The sweet tobacco and molasses definitely carry through in the smoke. I also get hints of spice on the retro hale. The hay and straw are there, but still in a subtle supporting role. The subtle sweetness is a great change of pace from the smoky English blends I've become accustomed to. I'm sure I'll pick up more notes as my palate becomes more refined and I smoke more of the tin. 

Body/nicotine: the is definitely a light-medium body. The nicotine strength is also pretty low. This could easily be smoked multiple times in a row or all day. 

Room note: I asked some non smoking friends and they found the room note to be quite pleasant. In comparison they found the room note of my English blends to range from tolerable to unpleasant. 

Overall: a delightfully sweet and flavorful smoke. This quickly became my new favorite tobacco. I'm glad I decided to try something new and different. If anyone has recommendations for similar blends I would be happy to hear them. This was my first flake and I'm eager to try more. I used the rubbing out method and cube cut method, but preferred rubbing. I'm also curious to try the fold and stuff method. I was worried about tongue bite due to Mac Baren's reputation but didn't experience it. When I was puffing away vigorously I felt a slight tingle on the tip of my tongue as if the smoke was reaching out to say "hey, slow down or I'll bite you" it was very easy to find a good smoking cadence. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone curious to try out a flake or venture away from English blends. 

Now some quick advice for fellow newbies. First, don't be afraid to branch out and try different blends and types. You may find that you like something else even more. Second, flakes aren't all that intimidating, don't be scared of moving away from ribbons and shags. Last, don't pack too tightly. For the longest time I was packing my bowls way too tight. I was having trouble finishing a bowl and required numerous relights. Once I figured that out I had a far easier and more enjoyable time smoking. I think I'm finally out of the technique learning curve. I also finally understand the idea of sip instead of draw. I was taking long slow draws as I would with a cigar, trying to fill my mouth with smoke. When I gave up on making big clouds of smoke and switched to small, gentle puffs I started getting more flavors, less tongue bite, and my bowl stopped getting too hot. I also enjoyed the whole process more and found it more relaxing. 
====================================
VonSausage: Solid first review. 

There's always something to be learned. I'm about a decade deep and I still find new stuff. Each blend and pipe are a little different and it's wonderful.
--
jb270: Thanks! It really is a very rewarding hobby. Hoping this will help stave off TAD, at least for a little while
--
VonSausage: $24 is cheaper than you can get it online. SP has it for $18 plus $10 shipping. If you can get it for $24 you're doing pretty good!
--
jb270: Good point! I completely forgot to look at shipping costs. I suppose if you were ordering several tins online would be cheaper though. 
--
VonSausage: Yep. Sometimes if you talk to B&M owners they'll cut you a break on multiple tins, too.
--
jb270: I happen to know the owner pretty well so I think the $24 price may have already been a little discounted. 
--
givemeyours0ul: Usually on a single tin sp does first class for like $3. Very strange.
--
misterzipp0: $10 shipping? You can buy up to 13oz (total weight including tins) and get it shipped 1st class for >$4.
--
====================================
misterzipp0: Very nice review and cheers to you for putting it out there!

Side note: I find it interesting that a lot of newer people are recommended and seem to gravitate towards Lat blends.  I guess it's because they are the easiest to "get" in terms of actually tasting something?  What made you choose them?

I'm still on the fence about them because I can't taste past the Latakia but I'm probably in the minority here.
--
jb270: For me, coming from cigars, lat heavy blends were appealing initially because they had a fuller and bolder flavor. I think they are widely available, every tobacconist worth their salt will have a bulk English blend on hand. They are also quite forgiving allowing beginners to learn proper technique and flavor. I'm guessing that most beginners started out with an aromatic and found it bland and tasteless, with English blends being quite flavorful in comparison. Bold smoky flavors are also easier to pick up on than subtle sweet, fruit, and floral flavors.

t90fan: > I'm guessing that most beginners started out with an aromatic and found it bland and tasteless, with English blends being quite flavorful in comparison

Here in the UK its kind of the opposite, most people's first smoke will be a Lakeland (very strong and flavoursome aromatic) like Condor or St Bruno as those are basically the 2 pipe tobaccos which you can buy OTC without going to a dedicated pipe shop.
--
jholen: I can definitely relate to the OP as my first foray into pipes I leaned heavily towards Latakia centric blends as I was looking for a similar depth and volume of flavor as I was used to with cigars. However, that focus really didn't sustain me and I gave it up to focus on cigars. I recently just picked it up not to replace cigars but rather to compliment them and am now focusing more on Virginia/Virginia blends as it's entirely different than cigars. 
--
misterzipp0: One of the biggest differences a cigar smoker that's smoking a pipe will see is the volume of smoke; it's a decent bit less.  

I remember the first few bowls I had and kept missing the sensation of all the creamy smoke rolling around my mouth.  
Once (if?) you get past that you can understand the nuances of the pipe.  I find pipe tobacco to be more subtle but have a huge variety of flavors. I find cigars to be bolder and less subtle but the flavors are very easy to pull out.

I had been smoking pipes for a few months when I picked up a cigar I was mildly familiar with and the taste blew me away!  I think pipe smoking can really enhance your palate and help you appreciate more subtle flavors.

I do wish a tobacco blend would capture that silky smooth flavor that a stick like Tora√±o Exodus Silver has. Man that thing is a Hershey's bar!
--
jholen: I think my shift from NCs to Cubans helped shift to a bit more of a nuanced flavor profile in the cigar realm, and think that has helped this go around. But what I missed and am enjoying so much now are Virginia's. Found that was the flavor I was craving. Love that subtle sweetness! 

I agree it is much more subtle and I feel I'm on the verge of really tapping into it. Just smoked a bowl of McClelland 2015 flake and loved it!
--
misterzipp0: Gotta love 2015, a sleeper of a VaPer!
--
jholen: Twas excellent!
--
jb270: I agree that it isn't exactly a replacement for cigars. It is, to use a tired analogy, like comparing apples to oranges. I have come to appreciate pipe smoking for what it is, and tend to save it for moments of quiet contemplation. Cigars I typically enjoy more in a social setting, or to mark special occasions. 
--
jholen: Yeah my approach this go around is entirely different than the first. Really enjoying it more... 
--
jb270: The only thing the two really have in common is that they both involve burning tobacco. I am curious to try a cigar leaf containing pipe blend at some point though. 
--
jholen: I was pretty underwhelmed with them but really only tried Billy Budd and Havana Daydream from C&D. That was when I tried piping a year ago. 
--
jb270: I plan on trying GL Pease's robusto at some point. I've had good luck with all the GLP blends I've tried so far
--
jholen: Heard good things of McClelland Dominican glory and I've really enjoyed most McClelland blends thus far.
--
jb270: I'll add it to my ever growing list of things to try
--
jholen: It didn't make the cut for my most recent smoking pipes order but it's on my wishlist -- too many darned tobaccos to try! Such a great problem we have ;)
--
====================================
claypainter: Solid tobacco - I tend to get honey notes from it.
--
jb270: Absolutely! The sweetness was familiar but I couldn't quite place it, honey is definitely it. 
--
====================================
fortheLOVEofBACON: Good review! Definitely one of my favorites, I get cocoa and nuts along with the sweetness you describe.

I hope you get to branch out more and try your palette with Oriental-forward blends. 
--
jb270: I hope to eventually. Any recommendations?
--
fortheLOVEofBACON: McClelland's Grand Orientals line. They have a bunch of these that showcase the particular oriental leaf. Yenidje Supreme is highly rated. 
--
jb270: I'll check it out
--
====================================
jonknight: For oriental-forward I'd recommend Sam Gawith's Skiff Mixture. 

Great review - and McB Navy Flake definitely one of the best presented and easy-to-smoke flakes out there. Fold and stuff should be pretty easy. 
--
jb270: Thanks. I'll look into it/add it to the list
--
====================================
Dsreven: there are navy flakes other than players and capstan?, news to me ;)
