Stonehenge Flake- review

All right then, its a review after only one bowl so keep that in mind.
Lets get the basics out of the way first
Strength= medium

taste= mellow and smooth, no bite whatsoever

nic hit= it packs a punch, its up there with nightcap and maybe even with OJK.

So you got a mellow tasting blend with a considerable nic hit. That is exactly what I look for in a blend. This is a smooth tobacco and I dare say there are none like it. Let me say first, my only objection to GH is that they use hands down best base tobaccos and chose to muck it up with their arsenic like essence, It is the case with this one as well. Its the carrot juice of pipe tobacco, you either hate it or acquire a taste for it (not to be confused with Ennerdale). I am referring to that almond-y aspect of the Lakelands, it is very much present throughout the smoke and it plays very well with the best Virginia I ever tasted. 

This is a serious blend, a masterpiece even. One one puff you taste the lakeland, perique on other, pure Virginia on yet another. Smoothness permeates the entire experience, from start to finish.Its just wonderful and I will definitely be buying more.
To sum it up a complex, smooth sweet lakeland blend.

====================================
PhysicsNovice: I knew it. I fricking knew it! Those damn Brits leave their nasty ass stank on everything. Oh well. Age and sell it...

====================================
freepancakesforall: It's great to see all the early reviews. But for the casual viewer, please keep in mind that it takes more than one or two bowls to fully understand a blend. Try the tobacco in a few different sized pipes. Try it at different moisture levels. Try it after a large meal. Try it while drinking water. Then with a complementary drink.    

It's perfectly acceptable to not enjoy something. But don't read one person's review and say "not for me, time to sell!" ESPECIALLY with nicotine levels. People can be all over the place. Except for Irish rope. That's fatal.

Nicotine will kill me on this one lol

misterzipp0: Nah :)

SupraMario: I'll die...

They will be like what happened and why are his shoes off?

O he smoked some stonehenge, it's like a medium strength blend, but all he can handle are aros.

zero-hunter: Damn Nightcap slays me. I hope I can handle this one.

====================================
None: I just smoked my first bowl of Stonehenge and I definitely tasted that essence. I can't quite put my finger on what I'm tasting though and I don't get it on every puff.
--
====================================
SmokeOnTheWater17: I did not get any essence but I did not find the smoke very enjoyable. It is raw and off tasting. Hopefully age will help. Otherwise, will be looking to trade. 
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: OK, different pipe, different taste profile. This is much better in a larger billiard. Sweet with a pepper underneath. Will be better with age. 
--
====================================
crimblade: I didn't get much of a nic hit from this one, I'll have to see what future smokes do to really pin down it's strength. I really enjoyed the subtle lakelands with the perique spice.

That being said, I feel like this blend would benefit a lot from a little age so I'm going to jar it and give it 6 months before popping it open again.
--
Alligator_Gar: I didn't say, 'Oh, that's good.'  More like, 'hmmm, someday this is going to be great.'     

Just not today.   

* PS The deeper I get in this bowl the more it tastes like Burley Kake.

====================================
FullFrontalNoodly: In regards to the Lakeland aspect, how does this compare to 1792?


--
RustyShackleford09: Not even close. 
--
FullFrontalNoodly: OK, but does does Stonehenge have more or less Lakeland than 1792?


--
RustyShackleford09: Totally different. And it's less than 1792. 
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: I did not catch any Lakeland. 
--
====================================
sonofwang: I got my tin in at work and haven't been able to smoke any but it smells just like Fribourg and Treyer High Dry Toast nasal snuff to me:
--
====================================
bak1984: I've had two bowls so far. The first was like getting punched in the face with Lakeland. It was heavy and actually gave me a bit of a headache. Let it dry some more and fired up another one today. Much more subdued. Still need some time to process whether I like it or not, but it's still fun to experiment with new tobaccos.
