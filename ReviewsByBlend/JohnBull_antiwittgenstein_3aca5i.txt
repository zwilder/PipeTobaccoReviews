Tobacco Review: John Bull

Review #41

**Blend Name:** John Bull

**Description on Tin:** English blends containing the mysterious and smoky tobacco, Latakia, have long been a mainstay among pipe smokers, and nothing is more emblematic of England than John Bull. A true connoisseur’s delight, this supremely cool and smooth mixture uses mild flue-cured tobaccos, mellow and nutty Burley, a touch of black Cavendish for a subtle sweetness and the star of the blend, magnificent Cyprian Latakia. The result is a well-behaved, all-day mixture that is ultra-flavorful but never overbearing. It’s exceedingly rare to find this kind of premier blend in a pouch, but John Bull is anything but ordinary.
 
**Leaf:** Mixture of nearly black and beige ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisiny vanilla – I thought this was supposed to an English blend?

**Taste:** Welp that is definitely Latakia. It isn’t overwhelming, but it is the forward note – smoky and a but savory. The smoke is incredibly creamy. There is a bit of sweetness to it, I think a touch of Virginia in there – adds a feint citrus note underneath the smoke. Develops slowly – but it develops. About a third way in some oriental flavors come through, savory with a bit of spice. Something about oriental leaf that tastes like sour cream and onion dip or ranch dress to me – complex, a bit garlicky. Shallots if I want to put on my yuppie scarf. The spice is a bare tickle, but once it starts, it burns hotter and hotter as the bowl follows its arc – growing from a mild white pepper to a mouth full of crushed red pepper at the end. The Virginia is long gone, there is but smoke and savory and spice until it turns to ash.

**Nicotine:** Somewhat present, call it 1 shot of bourbon.

**Smokability:** Packs, lights, and smokes easily. Zero bite.
 
**Room Note:** A bit smoky.

**Thoughts:** I have been intrigued about this tobacco for awhile and was pleased to finally try it. While this won’t go toe to toe with old mainstays like 965, this is certainly a true English tobacco. I would have rated it higher, but my second bowl turned pretty ashy in the last third, so be forewarned.

Some might call this a good budget English. Others would say a good beginner English. I am not inclined to agree with either sentiment, with regards to the online oriented smoker. At normal online prices this is $5 for 1 .5oz pouch – that is $3.33 per ounce. For just a few more cents you can get 965 or Nightcap. For $6 you can grab a tin of Sutliff Bosphorous Cruise which is my Balkan crush du jour. As for a beginner, those tobaccos would work as well. 

Where John Bull shines though, I conjecture, is in the physical store. Trapped on vacation with a limited OTC selection? This is a winner. At a b&m with low funds? This pouch will prolly set you back $9 instead of $18 for a tin.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Peter Stokkebye Luxury English, Dunhill Early Morning Pipe

**Summary:** John Bull is a quality OTC English perfect for that unplanned physical store purchase.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
tribial: Thanks for another great review. I don't imagine myself picking this up anytime soon. Also... I like grape nuts.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. That is not the 1st grape nut apologist I have heard this week. Honestly, many of these I haven't tried for twenty years or more, but blessing or curse, I can remember exactly how each smelled and taste. I am not sure they even make Cookie Crunch anymore.

Duly noted, I will give grape nuts another try.

tribial: lucky charms and cookie crisp (goopy aros) are both awful. Cinnamon life was my favorite growing up (well balanced Eng). and Cheerios (cheap dry burley) are the worst.
