Tobacco Review: C&D Pirate Kake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 92

**Blend Name:** Cornell and Diehl Pirate Kake
 
**Description on Tin:** A smooth, robust blend with LOTS (75%!) of exceptional Latakia accompanied by Turkish and Burley from C&D, Pirate Kake is a Latakia lover's treasure.

**Leaf:** Chunky dense kake. Even my 1 oz bag from S&P came mostly intact, the most intact bulk Kake I’ve seen yet. When you handled the stuff you understand why – it is uranium. So it takes quite a bit to rub out to a smokeable state. But even the interior of the kake is dry enough to immediately load up.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Smoke. Wood smoke. Texas BBQ brisket, still in the oil drum smoker. Earthy and a bit vegetal if you really get deep. Pine sawdust

**Age when smoked:** About a year.

**Taste:** Blech. Lavender and soapy latakia. Not as bad as Dunhill but not my favorite flavor. Big creamy smoke. Woody and spicey underneath. Floral flavors fade quickly thankfully. Some fun oriental stuff comes through after 10 or so puffs, red wine vinegar, sharp and puckering, a touch of salt. Piney and a bit meaty, like the tin suggests. Smoky. Grows earthy and richer, smokier, spicer. Herbal flavors and cooking spices – more pasta dish than dessert – come through. Feels stripped down and direct, a counterpoint to the kitchen sink English. It is just to the side of sweet. Not enough to call it sweet, just enough to push the other flavors. Something in the mustard and horseradish family. For one of, if not the, most latakia forward blends on the market, rumoured around 75%, if I tasted this blind I would guess it was mild Balkan. It does have moment when the leather and smoke come fore, there is that just hint of lavender I don’t care for, but the condimental leaf tells most of the story. Of course as soon as I type that I get into the last half or third and the orientals back, letting the smoke and leather and earth dominate. Nutty burley tones come underneath, but lighter, less Big N Burley and more Prince Albert. The vinegar sharpness is still there, but more at the edges of the mouth, less the leading lady. Now it is balancing out, with the oriental, burley, and lat all having their equal say. Sublime. Not like the band. If I was going to make a musical analogy I would say Puccini, the disparate voices sing their own piece then weave back together as one instrument. This is the steady state for the last 15ish minutes until the bowl quits on me.

**Nicotine:** 3Really, really light compared to what I was expecting

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** When you rub this stuff out you get little chunks so it feels natural to gravity feed this one and call it a day. I end up always having to tamp hard after the first few solid light I get. I’d recommend give it a gently push instead if you remember. Takes a few relights for me to get through a bowl, but it isn’t adverse to the flame.
 
**Side Stream:** Smoky, bbq. 

**Thoughts:** I was afraid of this one. Really high Latakia content, from C&D? I made sure to have my big boy boots on – and a bucket nearby. But it was surprisingly gentle, both with the Nicotine and the taste. It was amazing how they were able to blend so much Lat in such a way that still felt evenly balanced. It must be a more mild variant they keep around just for something like Pirate Kake.

At first I wasn’t enthused. Something about the expectations built up around this blend that didn’t pay out, combined with having had a stream of more ‘invite the whole party’ style English blends more recently. Then I got it. Like Mountain Camp, this is a simple, stripped down, acoustic only kinda blend. The magic is using just three components and creating something noteworthy from it. They did so admirably. The result is a really contemplative smoke with enough to keep you interested but not distract.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** C&D Mountain Camp, H&H Ten to Midnight
 
**Summary:** A well balanced high latakia blend with showy orientals

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**++++

Rating system (interpreted through the world of Dungeons and Dragons):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Rolling that Natural 20 right when you need to)

(++++) Great (Magic loot! Or Magic lute…)

(+++) Very good (Go ahead and level up your characters)

(++) Good (Nerd Camraderie)

(+) I think like it (The actual Role Playing)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (The rulebook says…)

(-) I think I dislike this (Math for fun?)

(--)This is not for me (You’ve had 20 minutes to decide your next attack, why does it take another 20 when it is your turn?)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Split parties = dead characters)

(----)This is suffering (4 sided dice don’t roll)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (That 3rd missed saving throw)

====================================
Dr_No_It_All: After a few years of aging, this stuff is gold.  Smoked a 3 year old after a fresh can.  Night and day difference.

Aboleth_Whisperer: I love it when I see /u/antiwittgenstein has posted a new review.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate.

====================================
bamicee: Absolutely love this one, and I recommend it to everyone who likes woody smoky blends
--
antiwittgenstein: If you haven't had em, check out the two similar blends. Mountain Camp is less deep, more piney. 10 to midnight is more oaky, with a heavy orange citrus component. Both are among my favorites.

====================================
mugwump867: Great review!  Pirate Kake is by far my favorite C&D blend.  I liken the flavor and aroma to oily, smokey leather with a bit of cigar thrown in.  And, yeah, for a blend touted to have so much Latakia it really isn't much of a Lat-bomb.
