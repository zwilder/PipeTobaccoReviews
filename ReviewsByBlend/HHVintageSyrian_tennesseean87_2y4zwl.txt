====================================
bonehed: I appreciate the reviews but the parent in me says 'please stop with the distracted driving!' 
--
tennesseean_87: Are you talking about smoking or video recording?
--
bonehed: Both really, but we all know you're *definitely* not going to stop smoking while driving no matter what [this](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/) says...
--
tennesseean_87: When it's this cold, that's about the only time I have to smoke. I keep a hand on the wheel at all times and reserve relights for when I'm at a stop or have no oncoming traffic (without taking my eyes off the road). 
--
bonehed: I hear ya and do the same, I'm just saying leave the video productions for some other, less dangerous (for everyone) time...
