3 P's - Peterson's Perfect Plug [Tobacco Review]

**Blend Name:**

[3 P's - Peterson's Perfect Plug 50g Tin](http://i.imgur.com/73bSi.jpg)

**Description on Tin:**

This excellent plug tobacco comprises selected Virginia leaf from Africa and Brazil blended with Burley leaf from Malawi. The tobaccos are lightly cased before drying and pressing and are then heated and stored for two weeks before cutting. The result is a full bodied yet fruity blend, sure to appeal to the experienced pipe smoker.

**Leaf:**

[Plug.](http://i.imgur.com/enETB.jpg)
The 2cm thick plug is very dark brown almost black with tan coloured flecks and streaks.
It is very hard and dense so you'll need a sharp knife to cut this in to flakes. Medium moist and solid, not very easy to rub out. Probably easier to fold or even cut into cubes or strips. A 2mm thick slice easily filled a small pipe.

**Tin Aroma:**

Comes [sealed in plastic](http://i.imgur.com/Mqpth.jpg) so no smell on opening the can. Once the plastic wrapper is off, it has a rich tobacco smell with no extras.

**Taste:**

It starts with quite a mild taste and a tiny bite on the tongue. It becomes rich and smooth with no specific tastes coming through. Imagine a chocolate mousse without the chocolate. And like chocolate mousse, by the bottom of the bowl your thinking “as wonderful as this is, maybe a smaller portion next time.”

**Smokability:**

Without drying it took a few lights to get going but then stayed lit for almost an hour. I'm a constant but slow puffer and had to stop a few times as the pipe was getting really hot. No gurgling.

**Room Note:**

No one to ask, but I quite liked it. Probably fairly strong. Lots of thick white smoke. 

**Recommend to:**

Anyone who likes flake tobaccos but wants to try a stronger plug.

**Summary:**

Pleasant, long lasting smoke with an honest tobacco taste and no flavouring. Not an all day smoke, more of a sensuous treat every once in a while.

**My Background:**

Long time pipe smoker many years ago. Just getting back into it after a 20 year break. I used to smoke Erinmore Flake almost exclusively with a few drug store brands when I couldn't afford the Erinmore.

polonium9: Awesome review! I'll be sure to check it out! 

What pipe did you use? A Peterson? :)

Erinmore: Thanks! It was my first review.

Yes, a brand new [Peterson bent apple](http://i.imgur.com/Oie9L.jpg). It was its maiden smoke.

polonium9: The maiden smoke to a tobacco pipe is one of the greatest feelings you get.

I'm VERY jealous of your Peterson... I've always wanted one! For so dang long!! You are very, very lucky. Being of Irish descent, I salute you.

None: Thanks for the review. I almost bought a tin the last time I went to the tobacco shop but I went with the Connoisseurs Choice. I'll make sure to pick up a tin next time.

drfalken: Read your review this morning and called 5 shops trying to find it because I HAD to have it today.  Found it at the 5th!  Just smoked a little and it is really good. It's the first natural I have had in a while. I really picked up on the chocolate tones, like many of the scents that make up fudge but without the chocolate. If that makes any sense. I didn't dry it out either but didn't really have much trouble lighting it. I smoked it in the living room and my girlfriend says "it smelt like tobacco" she liked the smell but not as much as the cherry blend I usually smoke inside. She says it lingers in the room more. I smoke cigarettes but I felt the nicotine hit me more than my usual blends or cigs or cigars. But it has been a long time since I smoked natural tobacco (don't know if that means anything). 
But i really like this 3P. Happy with my purchase. Thanks for the review!
