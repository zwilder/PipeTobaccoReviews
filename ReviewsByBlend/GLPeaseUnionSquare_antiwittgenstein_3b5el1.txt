Tobacco Review: GL Pease Union Square
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #43

**Blend Name:** G.L. Pease Union Square

**Description on Tin:** Union Square combines select Virginias, ranging from sweet, ascerbic golden leaf to toasty, zesty reds. The mixture is pressed to deepen and develop the flavors without the need to add a top-dressing or sweeteners. For the cleanest taste of fine flue-cured tobaccos, you have to give this a try.
 
**Leaf:** Standard brown ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisins and bread.
 
**Taste:** Toasty and sweet at first, more akin to a burley flavor in fact. There is a tingle of spice coming through. Now some proper Virginia flavors. Vinegar and maple syrup. Brown sugar. Caramel. Stewed dark jammy fruits. Creates a sort of Balsamic Vinegar effect. Hmm, I wonder that I haven’t picked up on that in another Virginia. Anywho. Complexity. Okay, that is not very descriptive, but bear with me. Floral, peppery, a dash of smoke, strawberries, the bright blue sky of a June afternoon which eases off into forever, a moment in which the memory of night is occluded. Reminds me of baseball for some reason. Earth. No, a sort of dirtiness which. I mean quite literally. Quite akin to the C&D burley kicks like Old Joe Krantz. Definitely a Emperor Palaptine sympathizing Virginia.That is the baseball connection, memories of playing little league, getting a mouthful of powdered earth as I slid for second base – yards too soon. Honey wheat loaf. Really, if I didn’t know this was a pure Virginia blend I would insist there was a chunk of burley hanging around here. Really as I reach the last third, it reminds of Old Joe – earthy, slightly peppery, just a nibble of sweetness, a faint lurk of smoke, buttered toast, whipping cream. Eases back a bit, into hay and grass, the undulating wheat fields of June before summer has won its suzerainty. 

**Nicotine:** Rather stout, I have to set this one aside every quarter to a third of the bowl. I will call it 3 shots of bourbon. The stoutest pure Virginia I have run across thus far.

**Smokability:** Dry to the touch. You will want to pack this a touch light. I used the old codger (scoop from the bag) packing method and gravity feed with just a gentle tap on top. Both worked beautifully. Produces a rather pretty white ash. A thin smoke, but it is far heavier than I am used to seeing Virginia smoke.
 
**Room Note:** Was a Wes Anderson film just shot in here? Premimum cigarettes and fresh sod.

**Thoughts:** This is the kind of tobacco which is made to shake your expectations. Pure Virginia I thought, I know what that means now, right? Some lemons, some raisins, a touch of pepper – pretty much everything I want in a summertime tobacco. I did not expect dirt and bread and dizziness and heat and most everything I tasted. The easiest to swallow explanation is: GL Pease is a liar and there is some burley in here. Maybe not much, but enough to change the whole nature of the smoke. The fairer explanation: this is a unique strain of Virginia quite unlike the yellows and reds to which I have become accustomed to smoking. It transforms my understanding and respect for the leaf. I like the lemonade stand and blueberry wine of Orlik Golden Sliced and its brethren, but Union Square shows a different flare, a Virginia more suited to serious evenings, a stream of smoke transmuting troubling thoughts into paper tigers. 

A final note: This last smoke – the end of my sample sadly (thanks pixee!) – gave me the heady experience shown above, but previous bowls were not as clear, sweet, or overwhelming. I have been smoking this steadily in the same pipe. I recommend that if you have the means, when your tin or sampler is open, that you dedicate a pipe to this so that the flavours can build up to this earth and vinegar peak.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Bayou Morning, Stonehaven, Erinmore Flake, Ole Joe Krantz, Fillmore.

**Summary:** A stomach churning dirt and vinegar pure Virginia blend which I swear has some burley lurking in there.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
Cycleoflife: Ah. I was just wondering what blend would have the least amount of casing. This might be a contender. Great review, by the way, I love the subjective perspective and steam of consciousness. But you lost me at the Bay Area ballplayer hate. I may not watch baseball, but I gotta represent. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! If you like a pure tobacco experience, this should be on your list to try.

I was big A's fan when I was a kid, but the fallout of the steroid era left me pretty disenchanted.


--
Cycleoflife: Me too, man. Me too. As far as the tobacco goes, I'm not sure if I'll like it, but I like the *idea* of it at least, so I got to try it. 
--
pixeechick: Being a Jay's fan myself, I am a little surprised at your support for the A's, but generally agree with it. I pine for 80s-early 90s ball with a naïveté and whimsy that I can't find in the game any more. Sigh. 
--
====================================
Mordenkrad: It's drier and deadlier than many of its counterparts, but it's got a lot of clean and delightful VA sweetness. Like a lot of the GL Pease and C&D blends, it's about as natural as natural gets, so things sometimes get a bit earthy. 

And no, there's no burley in it. It's all those dark VAs; they pack a punch when they mean to. 
--
====================================
pixeechick: That was one of my first tins, and I have no record of its age or tinning date, unfortunately. It was in my possession about a year I'd say before I sent it to you with about 6 months undisturbed there toward the end. 

Glad you enjoyed it! I'll agree it was better in a dedicated, small-bowled pipe. It was lovely at first but somehow lost its shine for me. I'm pleased it found a good home.

====================================
tennesseean_87: Is this the one he admitted has a pinch of latakia in it though it's undisclosed in the tin description?
--
hedonaut: You're thinking of Laurel Heights, which I also haven't tried. He's always sneaking some little twist of something into his blends, though. 
--
tennesseean_87: Ahh, that's the one. 
--
====================================
veritasserum: GLP has been my staple for many years.  I've been less happy with his later outings but this sounds like something you buy and hang on to.  Those VAs will get very tasty with time.

--
hedonaut: You've piqued my curiosity. What do you think has changed over time?
--
veritasserum: I think his newer blends are less subtle and nuanced as compared to his original ones.  I find the new ones have less dimension and complexity, at least the ones I've tried (which has only been a few).
--
====================================
hedonaut: Surprisingly enough, I haven't tried this one yet. I really want to after this review. It's amazing how much strength can come out of the right mix of Virginias, though. 
--
====================================
peckinpahhombre: Great review.  I enjoyed the stuff young, but when I tried a 4 year old tin, I was sold.  I have cellared the stuff pretty heavily.  It turns into pure, sweet VA goodness.  I truthfully think that with 10 years on it, it will be legendary.  Or at least I am betting on that outcome.  Not every bet turns out though, as we all know.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks pipemate! Conversations like this makes me wish I had started smoking 15 years ago. I am just now buying my first tins to cellar. When I have the means I will likely stock away a few of Union Square. 

pixee told me this was one of her first tins, so that must be 2-3 years ago. I don't know how much actual aging time it had in the tin, but it never tasted in the least bit young.
