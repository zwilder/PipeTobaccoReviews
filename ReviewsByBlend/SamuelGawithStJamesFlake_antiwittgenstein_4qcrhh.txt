Tobacco Review: Samuel Gawith St. James Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 72

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith St. James Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** A sumptuous blend of Virginias and Perique from Samuel Gawith, this big, bold British style flake incorporates a generous proportion of St. James Parish, Louisiana perique.

**Leaf:** Black and blood red rough chopped flake
 
**Tin Aroma:** McKetchup, Heinz 57, HP Sauce, a bit fruity, something fermented and malty

**Taste:** Immediate flavors are… leather and nutty and woodsy? Kinda surprising. Then the spice comes. It isn’t tame but it isn’t overpowering, sort of in the Anniversary Kake or McClelland 2015 VaPer Flake territory. Spicy and tangy I should say, as the two flavors seem married in this blend. A hard vinegar rinse with a citrus bite, lemons, oranges equally sweet and sour.  All of this over a woodsy background. Some plumminess just as good if not better than Full Virginia Flake. As it develops Savoury and dark flavors, a bit of soy sauce, a bit of Worcestershire sauce. Heinz 57. So McClelland aren’t the only ones to patent that taste. A good bit of meatiness there, akin to Black Irish X but not nearly as intense. Throws off a bit of dark cherry here and there too, either with or instead of the plums. As you flame the dottle – and you will – it completes the circle, becoming less tangy-hot and more leather-woodsy again.

**Nicotine:** 4 bordering on 5 – though I always seemed to smoke this after a very light meal but one of those times I was laid out for 90 minutes. I packed smaller, less dense bowls after that.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Painful as anyone who has encounter an SG flake would expect. I finally tried the microwaving method. It worked but didn’t really suit me as I believe the flavors changed a bit in the process. I resumed my old habit of tearing out a week’s worth of flake and letting it dry. In this delta like humidity it didn’t actually dry out that much, still having a bit more spring to it than I like. Stuff’n’fold was a no go, so it was always a tangle of rough strands and chunks. 

**Aged when Smoked:** This was jarred about 9 months.

This a new addition to the ole review format. It used to be most of my reviews were from the baccy fresh off the truck, but my cellar overflowth and I guess I need to account for the slight differences time can make.

**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but the sidestream smelled like tobacco and ketchup.

**Thoughts:** I would say this or McLelland 2015 VaPer Flake should be the gold standard of VaPer Flakes. They are quite similar though this one was a bit more varied in flavors, having more of the umami side and a bit more upfront the dark fruits region as well. 2015 is much easier to smoke and I remember being a touch spicier too, but I think overall, this is a superior product – but then again, this costs twice as much.

Tangential to this, this is a great test flake for our international friends who have limited access to McClelland’s products. Here you get the same McKetchup tin note and taste, not as strong, but it is still there. If you find this not just to your liking, but something you absolutely crave, then it is worth your while to fork over the shipping (and … I am so sorry… the taxman’s share) for blends like Blackwoods, Dark Star, and the Matured Virginia line. If you try this and *don’t* like this range of flavors, well you just saved yourself quite a bit of money and heartache.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** McClelland 2015, Sutliff Court of St. James, McClelland Blackwoods, McClelland Dark Star
 
**Summary:** Medium spice woodsy-plummy VaPer with some of the McClelland style Ketchup magic

**My Background:** **My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
mtn_mojo: I love your reviews! I am going to grab a tin of this stuff on my next order for sure.

I especially love that you used surf rock as your rating system. Just learned about La Luz, I am loving them! If you're interested in more sorta modern surf inspired surf stuff, if I may recommend the following: The Reigning Monarchs, Man or Astroman, and The Growlers!

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I just learned about La Luz a couple of days ago from a thread in /r/listentothis - I am going on a big surf rock kick. Thanks for the recommendations!
