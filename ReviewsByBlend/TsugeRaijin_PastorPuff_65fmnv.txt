Review: Tsuge Raijin

Component Tobaccos: Uhh.. This depends on who you ask. Smokingpipes has Orientals and Virginias, while P&C has Burley, Cavendish, Perique and Virginia. Tobacco reviews has Kentucky, Latakia, Oriental/Turkish and Virginia. There seems to be no consensus as to what's in it. 

Cut: Coarse ribbon.			

Tin Note: Tangy, like the elephant enclosure at the zoo. There's an underlying hay or grass mustiness. Interesting, complex and a bit off-putting.

Body: 9/10 

Strength:  8/10 

Nic: 7/10 

Mechanics: I have some trouble getting it lit. it has a tendency towards harshness upon lighting it up. After you get it going it is a cool, dry smoke.

Taste: 

1st half 

At first light you get a hit of oriental tanginess. A bit of spiciness from either the Kentucky or perique but I don't get any flavor from them. Definitively some Cavendish, it raises it's sweet head from time to time. I think I get hits of Latakia but I can't be sure. The star of this show are the superb orientals. They are deliciously tangy and help give the blend a nice full body.

2nd half

As I get down past half-way in my bowl I am becoming more confidant that this is Kentucky leaf and not perique but there is a note of fig, so I could be wrong. It may, very well, have both. At this point the orientals are starting to lighten up and the smoke becomes more homogeneous through to the bottom of the bowl. The Cavendish is definitively there, but not in abundance. It makes a few puffs through a bowl sweet. Nearing the bottom the smoky nature of the Kentucky really starts to come out.

Thoughts: I first picked this up a couple of years ago when I first started pipe smoking and the complexity of this blend was lost on me. As I revisit it today, man, I realize how great this tobacco is. They are really asking you to search this blend and pick out the component tobaccos. There is oriental tang, a bit of sweetness, some smokiness, some earthiness, a bit of fruit and undertoned with a musk that I can't place. It leaves a spice in your mouth, a smile on your face and you longing for another bowl.

Overall: 8/10

====================================
eelapl: An additional question (I'm pretty new so I'm trying to flesh out my tastes) What other tobaccos do you like?

Some of my favorites so far are RO Firestorm, Plum pudding and Magnum Opus. Could you say I might like this after knowing I really enjoy those? 

Thanks for your time!

PastorPuff: Some of my favorites are [Escudo](https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/A-C-Peterson/Escudo-Navy-Deluxe-50g/product_id/782), [3 Oaks](https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/mcclelland/Collector:-3-Oaks-Original-50g/product_id/54377), [Nightcap](https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/dunhill/Nightcap-50g/product_id/177) and [Pure Virginia](https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/mac-baren/HH-Pure-Virginia-1.75oz/product_id/185198).

I have never had Firestorm or Magnum Opus but reading the descriptions and component tobaccos I'd say give [St. James Wood](https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/mcclelland/Personal-Reserve:-St-James-Woods-50g/product_id/2893) a try, it lacks the Kentucky leaf but it is a very, very good VA/ per. Magnum Opus seems to be a [Durbar](https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/dunhill/Durbar-50g/product_id/265) lite. So, I'd give that a try too if I were you.

Plum Pudding is just so good I think that it's tough finding an alternate.

====================================
stogie-bear: Nice write up. I have a tin that I picked up at the Cigars International store last year and I think it will be one of the next ones I crack.  As to the blend, according to the description in the Drew Diplomat app, it's made by Daughters & Ryan and the blend his described thusly:

"A robust blend for the VaPer lover, this mixture packs a punch with a handsome portion of select, one-of-a-kind perique from St. James Parish, masterfully blended with select air-cured Dark, toasted burleys, Virginia tips and Fire-Cured tobaccos. This is a well-balanced and strong smoke."
--
PastorPuff: The stuff is good, you should give it a try. However, if you are looking for a VA/ per you'll probably be disappointed. I don't think that it comes close to being a VA/ per.
--
stogie-bear: Well I was definitely expecting something different. 
--
====================================
eelapl: I was tempted to get one of these series during IPSD but didn't putt the trigger, I was especially looking at this one. 

Thanks for the review, I think I'll definitely get this one during my next restocking.
--
PastorPuff: Go for it, I'd love to see this blend get elevated a bit. 
--
====================================
misterzipp0: Thanks for the review! 7/10 on the nicotine huh? Sounds like it's quite strong!
--
PastorPuff: Yeah it is. You're gonna feel this one. I don't typically 'feel' nicotine aside from a bit of relaxation but this one had me a bit woozy.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice writeup, much appreciated as I hear oodles about the tin art of this line, but never anything about the contents of said tins. Any similar tobaccos you could compare or contrast this with?
--
PastorPuff: Thanks! It does make me want to try the rest of the line. As for similar tobaccos, nothing comes to mind. It is very unique.
