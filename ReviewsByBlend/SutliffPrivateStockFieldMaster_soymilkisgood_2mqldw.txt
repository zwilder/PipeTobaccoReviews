Review: Sutliff Private Stock Field Master

**Blend Name:** Sutliff Private Stock Field Master

**Description on Tin:** Luxurious English mixture with Latakia and Matured Virginias

**Leaf:** Burley, Latakia, Oriental/Turkish, Virginia

**Appearance:** Coarse ribbon cut. Light, medium, and dark colored tobaccos evenly distributed throughout. 

**Tin Aroma:** Some sweetness and the typical smoky note of Latakia. A little bit of nuttiness as well, but very faint. The balance is nice on this one. I usually like some natural Virginia sweetness in my Latakia blends, so I think I’m going to like this one.

**Taste:** Medium amount of smokiness in this one is balanced with a little bit of natural sweetness from the Virginias. There is a tiny amount of nuttiness from the burley but it is very slight in comparison to the other flavors. The orientals are not detectable. 

**Strength and Nicotine:** Mild. It’s not going to satisfy the nicotine cravings of even a moderate smoker, but it’s better than an aromatic nicotine level-wise.

**Smokeability:** Beautifully mild, I could smoke this all day long. Not overwhelming in any department, it’s the tobacco equivalent of a session beer. I think it would be perfect to start the day, especially now that winter’s setting in.

**Room Note:** Your typical English room note but milder. Lightly smoky, but not overwhelming. Not going to please the girlfriend, but won’t send her running for the opposite side of the house, certainly. There’s a light Virginia afternote that is present as well. Nice mix of smells. The nuttiness is a little more prominent in the room note. But then again I’m smelling it mostly right out of the pipe, so my sense of the room note might be a little biased.

**Thoughts:** Solid mild English and I could smoke all day long. Non-offensive in any way, but also not particularly special in any way either. It’s the tobacco equivalent of a session beer – something tasty that you can smoke over and over again without getting tired of it. May not be the best to smoke around non-pipe lovers, but then again what English is?

**Recommend to:** Someone who wants a mild English to smoke all day, something to smoke in the morning, or something to sit down with if you want a lighter smoke. An individual that is starting out and wants to move on from aromatics and/or someone that wants to try Englishes out would be well-advised to try something like this tobacco out. It’s a nice introduction to the genre.

**Summary:** A nice light to medium English that’s a pleasant all day smoker. Nothing that’s going to offend or wow, it’s a solid middle of the road choice for someone looking for an English that’s a good representation of the lighter end of the style’s flavor spectrum. Although I wish it had more pepperiness, the lack of pepper overall makes it all the more smokeable over a longer period of time and/or multiple bowls.

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for nearly three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a few weeks ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and received six tins of Sutliff Private Stock in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is the fourth of many that I'll be doing as part of the program!

====================================
None: Nice review, I like this blend.

soymilkisgood: Thanks! It's not bad at all.

====================================
Flatticus: Excellent review, man.
--
soymilkisgood: Thank you. It was nice to get a break from all the aromatics.
--
Flatticus: Plus, TIL the expression "session beer".
--
soymilkisgood: Yeah, that's something I picked up from hanging around /r/beer. I sub to it but I only drink beer maybe once or twice a week, a beer or two at a time. Same thing with /r/bourbon. But then again, I only smoke a couple times a week too and I'm subbed here and to /r/cigars so I guess it's more the fun of reading what other people are drinking and smoking.

I swear I'm not an alcoholic, haha.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nicely done. I have been eying this blend even before I took the leap. Sounds like I will have to try it out soon, before winter ends. So in the next 6 months.
