Powdered Toast Man - A Review

Let's get the important stuff out of the way first: I really like this blend. It's only been one bowl, but I look forward to the next smoke tonight after dinner. I think the reason I like it is because I like burleys, and that's what this is. A solid sweet burley blend.

When I popped the tube (great presentation, btw), I was greeted with the subtle note of toasted marshmallows and pancakes. Not knowing if it needed drying time, I emptied the tube into a paper towel and let it dry for about twenty minutes. The tobacco is a very soft shag, and there is almost no topping present. It's easy to light, and stayed lit pretty well.

It's a light smoke, sweet from the start, and the toasted marshmallow hit my tongue about a third of the way down. It stayed subtlety sweet throughout the bowl. I barely picked up cinnamon, but did get a buttery-nutty flavor about half way down the bowl. This is an easy smoke that tastes good. I only smoke about once or twice a week, but I could see this being someone's all day smoke. As a burley fan, I would buy this, and smoke it often.

Thank you, u/coldsolderjoint and u/linearone for blending a nice burley aromatic, and giving me the opportunity to be your guinea pig.
