Tobacco Review: HEXAEMERON's Hand of God (Test Batch)
By: PereCallahan
---
First let me thank Hex for letting me be one of his guinea pigs for testing his new blend. I got it about a month ago but just now got around to having the time to review it. I promised him a formal review of it when I did, so here it is. 

**Blend Name:** Hand of God (Test Batch) 

**Description on Tin:** [None, but I do have a picture of the bag it arrived in.](http://i.imgur.com/l7W3hzm.jpg) 

**Leaf:** Pretty thick cut ribbon full of dark brown and black leaves. 

**Tin Aroma:** Light smokiness with a hint of a sweeter undertone. Smells very mellow for what this blend is supposed to be. 

**Taste:** Char light-Definite smoky flavor from the Latikia, light touch of cigar leaf shines through along with a sweet undertone I couldn't place. (Maybe oriental?)

The first part of the smoke is full of earthy tones and bursting with flavor, the Latikia is present but not in an overwhelming way, the cigar leaf still is just an undertone, and you get hit with some definite spiciness.

As the smoke progresses the spiciness mellows out and moves to the back of the smoke, still quite earthy with the cigar leaf in the back ground.

The end of the smoke is extremely smooth, with the Latikia having taken a back seat to be replaced by what I am going to go out on a limb and say is some oriental tobacco leaf. The cigar leaf stays in the back still and the spicy pepper taste is just the most subtle of undertones now. Overall a very delicious smoke.    


**Smokability:** The large cut of the tobacco makes packing a little tough but nothing a little draw testing can't make sure you get right. The blend is very easy to light which is good because it also goes out easily if you are not careful. The beginning of the smoke is a little harsh to the back of your mouth and throat but this goes away about 1/4 of the way through when the blend starts to mellow out. After that there is virtually no bite from this blend and the entire time it smokes quite cool. This is a nicotine heavy blend but it doesn't come right out and punch you in the face, it settles into your system over the smoke and by the halfway point you are smoking on an empty stomach you would be swimming. I almost feel on my ass when I stood up after smoking this and I smoked it right after dinner.  

**Room Note:** Smoked this outside so I couldn't really pick up on much but there was some of that signature Latikia camp fire to it.  

**Thoughts:** I can officially say I'm in love with this blend. It's almost like smoking a cigar but it still definitely tastes like an English and is not overpowering. This is a very good blend that Hex has outdone himself on, I would order a pound of this stuff with out a moments hesitation. Hex, I think it is time you quite your day job and become a blender. 

**Recommend to:** People that like nicotine heavy blends, English blends, and cigar lovers looking to get into pipe tobacco. 

**Summary:** This is an excellent blend for people looking for a massive dose of nicotine but don't want to be punched in the face by it at the beginning of the smoke. This is also perhaps one of the best full bodied English blends I have ever smoked and just wish I had more of it to be able to pick out the rest of the flavors that eluded me this time around. If Hex ever starts making this blend for people on this sub I highly suggest you put your name done for some.

Smoked out of a MM Legend on a relatively cool Atlanta night while listening to Stevie Ray Vaughn.      

**Rating:** 5/5

**My Background:** I have been smoking pipes for over a year and a half now and have tried many different blends in that time frame, as well as collected a few too many pipes. My favorite blends are Virginias and Virginia/Periques and non Lat heavy Englishes and I do not like Aro's.    


====================================
HEXAEMERON: Thank you very much for the review! I'm glad it turned out to your liking. I'll work on chopping down some of the thicker-cut components of the blend to aid with packing.  
  
The blend is light on the latakia, though heavy in cigar leaf, perique, and a nic-heavy VA. There are two types of Oriental tobaccos in it, as well as some burley.  
  
I'm glad this translated into a smokeable yet nicotine-heavy blend!

PereCallahan: Out of curiosity what have the other testers been saying about it? 
--
HEXAEMERON: Good question. You're the only one I've heard back from. Thanks again!

====================================
Sawysauce: Given that review, officially sign me up for some of the next batch! 
--
PipeSipper: Likewise!

====================================
lolwat_o_O: How... do we get a hold of this?
--
physicsyakuza: Same question. I need this in my life
--
HEXAEMERON: Maybe try contacting the guy who blended it?
--
lolwat_o_O: But.. but... that makes too much sense... 
--
PipeSipper: Well, hey hex, how can we get some? Lol
--
HEXAEMERON: Well, by now the rest of the test batch has been claimed. When I blend some more and it's ready, I'll make a post in /r/PipeTobaccoMarket.

asdf3730: Great review. I remember hearing about this some time ago. What would you say about it for someone who smokes mostly aromatics but has just had a successful foray into english blend via FMOTT?

Thanks for the review! I am interested
--
PereCallahan: If you can handle the nic hit I would say it makes for a great English if you like FMOTT. 
--
asdf3730: I may give it a try, thanks!
