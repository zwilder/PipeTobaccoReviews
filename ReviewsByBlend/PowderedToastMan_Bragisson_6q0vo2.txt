====================================
Bragisson: Initial note from the bag is right on, the cinnamon-sugar is not overdone, nor confused with maple, well done. It's exactly how I was hoping. 
Now, I'm not too big of a fan of aromatics. For one, they are never strong enough, and two, they sit too sweet on my tongue. 
How other Aros made me sigh in let down, Powdered Toast Man delivers a triumphant roar. 
Lighting up the tobacco, for many aros, you'll get a strange chemical taste. Not with PTM. I was met with a friendly surprise; warm, and a gradual cinnamon sugar that didn't make me gag. It hit nice against the throat - which many aromatics don't (yeah shoot me, I inhale) The room note had my partner begging me to try some herself, which I obliged happily. When she handed the pipe back, I was met with a considerable changeup. This is when the toasted notes started shedding themselves, and the mix between a now gradually fading cinnamon, and toasted tobacco made it hard to pace myself. This taste kept itself throughout the majority of the bowl. 
As the tobacco slowly turned to ash, I had a weird moment as a kid at my friends house when his mother would make these homemade pastries. No other aromatic has ever brought back memories, so I'll add that to the list of positivities. 

Overall, two thumbs up. This is definitely a winner when it comes to aromatics, and coming from someone who prefers straight Virginians and English tobacco, that's a hefty compliment.
