Tobacco Review: C&D Big 'n' Burley
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 60

**Blend Name:** C&D Big ‘n’ Burley (aka Big & Burley No. 103)
 
**Description on Tin:** Big & Burley is a lightly sweet, rough cut Burley with hints of earthy Turkish, deep, smoky Latakia and fruity/peppery Perique. The result is a blend that delivers a real, natural, nutty Burley flavor that’s enhanced, not masked, by the other players.

**Leaf:** Very short nutty brown ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Sweet and sour. Vinegar.

**Taste:** Burley mouth. That might not be a taste, but it is a sensation. Mellow burley, nutty and just barely sweet. The condiment tobaccos are noticeable, a bit of smoke and tang from the Latakia and oriental. Fruit and peppery spice from the Perique. An elegant taste, rich and creamy, very much like there was cigar leaf in here. One of the most striking things about this tobacco is what is *doesn’t* taste like: sour. None of the classic C&D souriness that is exemplified by its close stablemate, the legendary Old Joe Krantz is in here. And you know what, as much as I like OJK, I think that this makes Big and Burley great, and noticeably different. OJK is more of an old fashioned codger blend by its tastes, the kind that makes me look at my hand tools with longing and feel wrong when I don’t smoke it out of my banged up cob. This blend is more sophisticated and rich. It makes me want to finally start putting that walnut paneling up. I think this comes from the sparing, but impactful addition of the oriental, Latakia, and Perique. Notes of cocoa come out. But the star of this, as you would imagine, is the burley. Rich, warm, just barely sweet. If you want a pure tobacco experience, this would be a fantastic addition to your rotation. Doesn’t go bitter even when you chase the dottle. 

**Nicotine:** Rather strong. Maybe not quite OJK level but close enough. I only smoke a half bowl at a time. You have to respect this one.

**Smokability:** It comes classic C&D dry and smokes well as long as you pack it right. 
 
**Room Note:** Rich tobacco, nutty and bready and sweet. Good for someone who likes that sort of thing.

**Thoughts:** What a tobacco. I love OJK but I might actually prefer this one. I know. My apologies.

My only complaint, and what keeps this from hitting the top echelon of my scores, is – and /u/hedonaut is tired of hearing this one – it is so fresh and young. This is results in the harsh burley mouth. It dissipates from the first light. Or you get used to it. But it is a black mark on an otherwise phenomenal blend. This has only sat in the jar about two months which is not quite enough time. I would suggest if you have the patience and funds to buy Big and Burley 6 months to a year out from smoking it, just like you might for a Virginia.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Old Joe Krantz, Billy Budd, Prince Albert
 
**Summary:** An elegant burley with just enough condiment tobacco to perfect it.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
SupraMario: Nice review, I haven't gotten to much on the burley train. I do have some 2010 MB Burley, London Blend that I finally opened for the first box pass from levins0 and still haven't tried it. It has called to me though, as I have another unopened tin of it...Might have to give it a shot soon.

====================================
carnesy: Almost bought some of this but decided to go with a selection of LJ Peretti blends instead. I haven't been a fan of burley in the past, mostly due to not getting good quality blends and an inexperienced palate, but after some more pipe experience  and education on what blends use good leaf I decided to jump in and see what's what.
--
antiwittgenstein: I have almost tried all the burleys I have now. I reckon I will have to get to those LJP blends sooner or later as they are always lauded when the Burley conversation comes in. Burley is tough to get into. It is drier, less expressive, and frequently brutal on the senses. Plus the aforementioned burley mouth. But I am really enjoying my journey into it thus far, though I am just getting started.
--
GanDuff: I highly recommend picking up and trying some Peretti, it'll change everything you know about Burley blends.

/u/LJPeretti can probably help you pick out some good blends to try as well. My personal recommendations are going to be Blend No. 333 and Cuban Mixture.

Let us know what you think if you ever pick some up.

Cheers

carnesy: I went with  2 ounces of:

Cuban Mixture

Blend 1072

and 1 ounce each of:

BPC

DD

102

333

33

Seemed like a good bit of what I was looking for in my smokes. All that shipped for just under $40, would have been cheaper but I didn't know about the 15% off code that was posted on here. That paired with the smoking pipes order I also placed should keep me quite happy for a while.
--
GanDuff: Nice. Have you tried Cuban and 333 yet?
--
carnesy: Nope just ordered last night so it won't ship till tomorrow at the soonest and will likely take 3+ days to get here while the whole north half of the east coast digs out. Will make for something nice to have when I reconnect with some HS buddies on Friday night though.

After you and Den talked up CM I figured I'd go in for a tin's worth. While figuring out what I wanted 1072 sounded right up my alley on Tobacco Reviews so I grabbed another tin's worth of that.
--
GanDuff: Well then, you're in for a real treat!
--
carnesy: Same. I was about to jump on a big Va order but held back from ordering right away. After a few days (and a hangout chat with /u/ganduff and /u/mordenkrad) I decided to give some burley blends another go and loaded up with 7-8x 1 ounce samples of LJP blends. 

I think in some ways so many people start with Englishes because those are the most immeadeately flavorful and easy to taste, then once they can find the nuances they move to Va blends. At least that's what happened with me. I then found enjoyment in previously disliked Kentucky and Dark Fired blends and decided to give burley another go. I smoked from a fresh pouch of Carter Hall today while shoveling snow and was shocked at how flavorful it was, especially compared to a little over a year ago when I last tried it. Back then it was pretty tasteless and boring to me.
--
Mordenkrad: I'm telling you man, I'm not crazy. Carter Hall has a 2 week shelf life from when the pouch opens and it's fucking beautiful in that sweet spot.
--
carnesy: Yup and it's caking up the old basically unsmoked Peterson I got off of ebay nicely. Between breaking in that one and the other pipe I got from the same guy I think the pouch will be gone with in the 2 weeks.
--
GanDuff: I was lucky enough to try some Peretti Burley blends early on in the hobby, and I truly appreciate good Burley because of it. Admittedly, I haven't strayed far beyond Peretti blends, Orlik Dark Strong Kentucky (oh, so good), and the occasional Carter Hall.

I've still got plenty of tobaccos that I need to try and learn about, but as it stands, Peretti makes amazing Burley blends.

Let me know what you think of the Peretti blends you bought.

Cheers
