Review thread! Put them in here with a 0-4 star rating.
====================================
Doc_Hooligan: I love Virginias. I can't seem to get enough of them. I've tried quite a few and I have to say that I'm a fan of Bijou. It's a decent Virginia-based blend with just a hint of honey casing to add a touch of additional sweetness, and just enough Oriental to give it a little spice. Room note is pretty mild; it's got an earthy, grassy flavor with a hint of sweet and spicy, and requires little to no dry time. The primary drawback that I've found is that the additional sweetness from the casing disappears after a short time, and the spiciness of the Oriental fades out after about half a bowl, leaving the Virginia as the star of the show. While I would like the accents (the honey casing and Oriental) to stay around a play a little longer, it doesn't fall flat. There is still the grassy, fresh aroma and taste that I expect from a Virginia, although maybe not as bright as some others. I've never had it bite me, even if puffing pretty aggressively. All in all, it's a decent Virginia and a pretty pleasant smoke. 

3 out of 4 stars

crimsonrat: This is a good one and one of the few newer blends I'm genuinely happy about. I rub it out, as with most flakes, and the moisture is where I like it out of the tin. It's sweet all the way down for me, even more toward the bottom. Kind of a pleasant sour fruit flavor at times, maybe the oriental? Light on nic, but has a rich flavor and isn't bitey at all. It's a really easy smoke, and I'd consider it an all day. Bought a handful of tins, but will likely buy more. 

3/4, higher with age, no doubt.

Ferivich: I've never had a bad experience with Bijou while smoking it (it sitting on a shelf is another story) and it quickly moved it's way into my normal rotation.

It's a solid everyday smoke, it's light, sweet and dry. Directly from the tin it smokes well, is a good moisture content. Flakes break down is easy and I found stuffing/folding/etc to be a bit on the finicky side.

I get a lot of honey on the charring light and maybe the first quarter to third of a bowl, at which point the virginias and orientals really step forward and make for a nice pleasant smoke with the faintest hints of honey every so often through out the bowl. Those honey hints remind me of the pleasant surprise the cavendish in Luxury Bulls Eye flake provides.

This is a blend that has handled well for me in meerschaum pipes as well as briar pipes, it doesn't get wet, doesn't bite and is pleasantly not as bright as a lot of other virigina based blends.

I'd give it a three out of four star rating. I'm interested in coming back to this blend in a few years to see how it's changed.

hvywldrnss: Imagine sitting on a moss covered forest floor surrounded by freshly fallen oak trees, packing your pipe with a middle of the road Virginia of decent age while enjoying a peanut butter and honey sandwich.

The Virginia is slightly grassy but not young. The Oriental is woody, nutty & slightly musky but not spicy. I clearly detect a natural honey topping but not cloying in a Danish style. 

As intended I expect this to age quite well. I'm excited to find out what a few years of age will do to the Oriental/Turkish component of the blend.

This is the first C&D tobacco I've truly enjoyed and wanted to cellar. I have plenty stocked up and will eventually add a few more tins to inventory for the future.

3.5 stars.

None: I smoked 2 tins over the past month, love the Virginias in this blend, I'm too novice to give it a rating though

dfafjf: I bought a tin just so I could join in on the reviews and feel like I'm part of the community. I smoked another bowl a few hours ago, and while this is a good tobacco, I'm not crazy about it. I enjoy the initial sweetness and I agree with another review who said there is a musky quality to it (which I usually enjoy). 

Sadly I feel like the second half of the bowl isn't great. I don't think I can put my finger on exactly what I dislike but I'm glad I only bought one tin. Overall it is a good smoke but not something I'm gonna stock up on. 

BUT NEXT MONTH... I'm really digging the Brown Sugar Flake I was able to get from the one and only /u/dankpipes. If anyone has any leads on where I can get more of that PLEASE let me know.

givemeyours0ul: When I started looking up the link I thought it would be cheaper. Then I was already there, one thing led to another.... And that's how you were conceived!

hedonaut: Having smoked through some of the prototyping process, then, finally, smoking through a tin of the finished product, this has become one of my favorite "sweet" Virginias. To my taste buds, the Katirini follows the whole way down, but the honey bolsters up the Virginias just enough to keep it in balance. While on paper, I might have liked more Katirini (I'm a whore for all things Turkish), I think the final blend had a lot more balance. Somewhere in the 3-4 category for me. Unusually sweet for a C&D Virginia blend, but perfect for when I'm in the mood for that kind of thing and want something brighter in profile than Winchester. 

EDIT: I'm smoking this now in a little Sara Eltang poker. Green tea, that's the main flavor note to me. Green tea with just a touch of smoky leather in the background and a touch of honey on the front. Very earthy without being dry at all.
