Tobacco Review: Hearth and Home AJ's VaPer
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #2

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home's AJ's Vaper

**Description on Tin:** Blended with Andrew (AJ) Smith, this is a different  turn on the Virginia/Perique genre. A variety of red Virginias is combined with a generous amount of Perique, and the mixture is slightly mellowed and sweetened by Green River black Cavendish

**Leaf:** Light brown ribbon cut with a smattering of small black chunks.

**Tin Aroma:** A bowl full of Kellog's Raisin Bran.

**Taste:** This tobacco gives two different experiences, one for briar, one for a cob.

Briar: Starting off, tobacco. Just plain tobacco Like smoking a Marborlo to be honest. A bit ashy sometimes. Grows into a virginia like flavor, but very subdued. Ocassionally a bit of tang or raisin will show, but very fleeting. About halfway through the bowl the perique asserts itself. It is not overly heavy, but you cannot ignore that steady black pepper hum. It quickly builds then plateaus well before becoming over whelming. The next (and final flavor) you will taste is ash.

Cob: Starts off pure, sweet virigina. There is a light playfullness about the smoke, switching between solid tobacco flavor and a pleasant dark fruit sweetness. Tastes more of burley than virginia to be honest. Halfway to three-quarters through the bowl the perique shows up, but it is not a pepper-pot. Hums along happily till it ashes out.

**Smokability:** Easy to light, keeps lit. Give it 5 minutes or so to dry out. Yields a thick smoke that doesn't mind forming rings.

**Room Note:** Almost maple syrupy. Very pleasant.

**Thoughts:** In a briar, this a is strong meh (+/- on my scale) - however, if you throw this into a cob, it sweetens up, and gives off more of the few flavors this tobacco offers. 

**Summary:** A pretty tame VaPer with no obvious flaws.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
crimsonrat: Really good review, thanks! I tried some and liked it actually. Big points for the rating system.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I think this will be a pretty swell smoke after maturing for awhile. 

I hope the rating system works out, but I am afraid it will suffer the same issue of the 4, 10, 100, or letter scale - that most everything will fall over about 30% of the range, wasting both its resolution and usefulness. Let's see if I can come up with another cultural reference with 11 points of comparison by next week...

AleWatcher: Excellent review---  I feel like reviewing something.....   using Pixies songs as my scale.....
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I won't sue, I promise.

====================================
ColinOnReddit: Irrelevant to the discussion, but what's a vaper in regards to pipe tobacco?
--
Darwin7848: Actually is really should be written VaPer. It refers to blends that combine Virginia tobaccos of various sorts with Perique which is a dark spicy fermented tobacco made in Louisiana.
--
ColinOnReddit: Oh. seems unnecessary and problematic. *Vaper* is already in the tobacco/nicotine lexicon. 
 
(Ironically, I just finished a VaPer. That's the last time I'm describing a blend as a VaPer.)

Just another side note, can we stop abbreviating everything. *TBH,* I'd rather live in a world where we fully explain our thoughts.


**Thanks for the explanation though!**

Chrisj2001: I just spoke with Reddit and they agree; all abbreviations will be terminated as of midnight CST, err, central standard time.

ColinOnReddit: Tnx
--
Chrisj2001: NP, BFF. 
**TL;DR** NP

====================================
Darwin7848: I dunno.  Might be good to have a bit of differentiation from "vaper" which is what folks who use them there funny e-cig thingamajigs call themselves.
