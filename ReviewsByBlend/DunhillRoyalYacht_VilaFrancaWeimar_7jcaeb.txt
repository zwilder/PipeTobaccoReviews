Royal Yacht by Dunhill: A Review
By: VilaFrancaWeimar
---
Royal Yacht could only be made in England. Think of it this way; what is a royal yacht? It is a gigantic boat that was made for the royalty of silly places that still like that sort of power dynamic. The fact is, many places in the world had some sort of a royal yacht: Spain and Egypt had one, Italy and Germany were crazy enough to have had three, some places were so connected to the maritime world that even had more than that, like Norway (7), Denmark (8) and my home country of Portugal (6) that decided to kick the royals to the curve but keep the ships! Think of it like the Air Force One of the seas that only gets replaced very occasionally when it is really needed. Cut to those crazy chaps in the UK that had 85 different royal yachts since Charles II! No wonder our dear Alfred Dunhill was so focused on it! It was on his British DNA. All jokes aside, this is a very unique and curious blend that I wanted to review for the sub, and if you never tried it before, I urge you to get it out of the checklist.


Royal Yacht is a Virginia based blend with a plum topping.


Before the smoke:


Smells really great, which is really not a good sign in my book. The best smelling tobaccos I’ve ever had were boring, would bite me, tasted like bitter gunk, or all of the above. There is a difference, however, that in this case it actually smells kind of natural, as if you actually had tobacco inside your tin! Either way, it smells like dessert, not like the manly mixture it is... you get dried fruits, raisin like, sugary sweetness, mixed with the actual smell of tobacco. The cut is classic Dunhill ribbon, packs really nice.


Beginning of the smoke:


Burns even and great, but it starts kind of a medium strength mixture and progressively gets kind of heavy when it comes to strength and nicotine.


During the smoke:


Wow. You can really tell it is heavier with the Nic-Hit, and I usually don’t even bother with that sort of stuff. Tastes real sweet, but it also has a heavy hand. You will feel like you are eating a fruit that God made specifically for lumberjacks or firefighters, you know, real manly dudes.  Well, in some pipes it is kind of nice and a great mixture to have around your mouth for 45 minutes, in other ones it is a nightmare! I really recommend a filter, because it might aid you to really getting to know it before you get scared by its strength. Either way, the taste isn’t just the plum topping. You can clearly tell that the topping is here to exacerbate and work with the already existing flavors of a Virginia. It really blends together, and I get to the point that I just cannot tell what taste derives from what (which, as I mentioned in other critiques, makes me a pretty crummy reviewer). It makes it better than the gloopy aro’s that I have encountered before.


After the smoke:


Christ, I really need a glass of water, the back of my throat feels like a tar factory. Room note is neutral, I guess. It doesn’t stink up the place, but it also doesn’t make it smell of plums. Beard note is kind of nice.


Overview:


Don’t get me wrong, it is a great tobacco… just not for my rotation. I can see myself buying more just to enjoy during Christmas time because that is for aromatics and giving second chances to toppings. I see some of you guys puffing on cherries and grapes and the likes, and I just feel like the Grinch. Now, I don’t want to be a snob and say that I just don’t like toppings and casings, because I know most mixtures (if not all) have them, they are just more subtle. I usually like my tobacco to feel more “tobaccoey” but the Royal Yacht really didn’t offend my taste buds at all. It really reminded me of the Peterson blends that I have tried (with the exception of Old Dublin), that are made with fantastic tobacco, blended with expertise and then the topping is added to accentuate the natural flavors. I even think I like the Royal Yacht a little bit more than those, but then again I haven’t tried them all. By the way, let me be clear, I wouldn’t consider this blend an aromatic, because it doesn’t emanate aroma from smoking. Of course it smells like something, like absolutely everything in the world, but it doesn’t make the room you are on smell like plum. I wouldn’t say the same for some of those Peterson blends. 


When it comes to nicotine, you just got to like it, or at least be used to it, or else you will never really enjoy this powerhouse of a blend. However, as I said before, an actually good filter would do the trick for our lightweight brothers. It is not super complex, but it is definitely a sit down type of blend.

brainskan13: Great review, thanks. This is one of those blends I always wonder about, but I think I am too wimpy to handle that level of nicotine. This reconfirms my suspicion. I believe the folks who love it and say it's a great smoke. It's a classic blend from Dunhill. I just don't see myself stocking it in my cellar. I would probably try a bowl.

vertdeferk: I went to a concert, smoked Royal Yacht, and shotgunned Red Bulls. It was a truly glorious night.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you, man. I'm glad you've enjoyed it! Honestly, it isn't going to kill you with all that nicotine. Try it with a filtered pipe after a nice meal and you will probably enjoy it. A lot of people appreciate dunhill blends like nightcap, elizabethan and the likes. If you can smoke those, you can certainly smoke this blend too. Don't  overthink it too much. And hey! If you smoke a pipe, you probably ain't a wimp!

brainskan13: I bust out some FVF and enjoy it now and then. I can handle stronger stuff like that occasionally. I just have to be very careful and pay attention to my pace. Same goes for me and cigars.
