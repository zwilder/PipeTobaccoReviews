Tobacco Review: GL Pease Gaslight

Review # 100

**Blend Name:** GL Pease Gaslight
 
**Description on Tin:** A rich Latakia mixture pressed in 1 oz cakes

On a misty, moonless night, along twisted cobblestone lanes illuminated only by the glow of ancient iron lanterns, you follow a scent as dark as the night itself, the exotic fragrance hauntingly familiar, compelling, irrestible.

Uh, pretty, but not that helpful.

From tobaccoreviews.com, a quote from Master Pease:

"Deep, rich and full flavored, Gaslight burns very slowly, delivering a lingering, satisfying smoke for the true connoisseur of latakia based blends. The red Virginias present a background of natural sweetness, whilst fine Orientals provide just the right amount of spice. I like it best sliced thinly, rubbed out and packed loosely in smaller bowls for a satisfying, surprisingly long-lasting smoke."

**Leaf:** If I gave out points for presentation this might be my favorite so far. The tin holds two dense dark brown to black plugs. They pull apart easily or slice readily with the knife. If you slice with the grain you get ready made flakes, often which peel apart into almost individual tobacco leaves. If you cut against the grain you are gonna get something more akin to ribbon. No matter how you slice it – sorry – the leaf is just a bit damp to the touch immediately after surgery, so give it some time to dry.
 
**Tin Aroma:** This is a funky one, funky and powerful when you crack the tin open. Sour, burnt rubber, Sulphur, roasted nuts, wood smoke.

**Age when smoked:** About one and a half years (which equates to about one metric year)

**Taste:** Smoky, earthy, leathery goodness and…and then the funk starts. What is going on here? Citrus, lemony, salty, floral. Lemon-pepper-mustard sauce. Especially on the retrohale. Sweetness from either Virginia or Oriental. High wailing orientals, metallic and woody, sharp and furry, there is this distinct flavor here which is *new* to me. I mean it is flavor, separate from the rest which I have no experience in food or drink to compare it to. It would be like viewing a painting and seeing a new color pop out. Not a mixture of other colors but something your brain just learned out to decipher. Sort of like lemon-grass and seaweed if you had to press me. Grapes. Smoky again, with a floral lavender soapiness. This soapy lat doesn’t bother me as much as the Dunhill stuff does, or maybe it is just better integrated here. Incense. Matchhead Sulphur.

In the second half, this turns into more of what I expected, a big, Latakia forward English. Smoky and woodsy, leather and earth and cigar like notes. The citrus is tamed and the oriental madness tappers down to just an incense like note.

**Nicotine:** 4-6. Pretty variable, I go quite awhile then hit a power pocket and usually have to put myself in timeout. 

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** An honorary McClelland flake. Which is not a compliment. It is such much fun to be able to cut my own flakes. It would be nicer if I could *smoke* my own hand cut flakes. Once it gets going it is great though. I like to sort of cannonball or just cram my flakes in the bowl and then rub out a generous portion for the top. I mean not just a dusting, but a complete layer. This minimizes but does not eliminate the slow start.
 
**Side Stream:** Floral incense.

**Thoughts:** Wowza. I mean I had high expectations, this stuff has a cult, but so do quite a few other blends I have reviewed and found to be mediocre or at least not life changing. This one delivers. Smoking my first bowl my immediate thought was to order more. Let me be clear – I have an unhealthy TAD but after threeish years of pipe smoking I still don’t go deep on anything.

As another aside about expectations: I was expecting something smokier and woodsier. I guess because people call this an English Plug, but really it is a Balkan Flake by my tastes, with the oriental taking precedence and the smoke hanging back, at least until the end. So if you are a real Lat hound it might not do you right, but for us that regularly Balkanize ourselves, look this one up when you can.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Kind of its own thing, but if I must, C&D Star of the East, H&H Cereberus, H&H 10 to Midnight
 
**Summary:** Oriental-earthy funky chunks’o’goodness

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
SickWillie: Review 100! Dang man - congrats! Also, thanks for adding yet another tobacco to my SP wishlist... this sounds delicious!
--
antiwittgenstein: Feels like a real milestone. I know I am ages back from guys on tobaccoreviews, but I also write more longform and am a few decades younger. It also very close to my actual piperversary.

zero-hunter: Damn, haven't seen a natural log since high school algebra.

antiwittgenstein: Eat more fiber.

SickWillie: Bad bot
--
====================================
Zenith251: Your reviews are wonderfully written, clever, and helpful. That's a C&D I haven't had yet, so thanks, very informative. 

Also, you had me at Metric Years.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks man, I try to capture the tobacco as best as I can. This is one that I can basically guarantee a Balkan/English smoker will like.
--
====================================
zero-hunter: How fast does the nic creep up on you? 
--
antiwittgenstein: It is slow, but always catches me unawares, I guess because of the slow build up. Suddenly I realize my vision is wonky and say that is that. Since I always stop it early, it hasn't made me sick yet. If I smoke it in my sav pot, I can do a full bowl. It is just my meer calabash I have to bail on.
--
====================================
professor_throway: I have a love hate relationship with Gaslight. Sometime it is in the zone and amazing most of the time it is meh. I just can't seem to figure out what makes it sing. The flavors are all there just muddy.
--
antiwittgenstein: I've been lucky and all the bowls I've had were great, but that really isn't that many at this point. The preparation of it is so dicey and customizable, I can see how it could go awry easily. What's your approach?
--
professor_throway: I have tried to slice it thin and rub out, cube cut it, blender it. I have had great smokes all way but mostly mediocre. It is frustrating that the "plug" is so loose that mine had pretty much fallen apart into layers by the time I opened the tin. I sort of have to stack the thing back together to try to slice it.  Jackknife plug was much denser and stayed together much better than Gaslight for me. 
--
antiwittgenstein: I wonder if this is batch variation, age, humidity, Coriolis force effects, or something metaphysical, but my plug is *dense* - it gave up flakes pretty easily when I first started carving, but now a few months into it, I am almost thinking hammer and chisel are the way to go. I am sorry you got a bunk plug. Might be interesting to see if anyone else here has a loose or dense plug vote.
--
====================================
postprandialrepose: Slice all the way through the plug to experience the blend as intended, try using a small or medium bowl, and smoke thoughtfully.
--
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Great review! Thanks!
--
====================================
MrHieronymus: Damn, now I gotta smoke another bowl of it. It's like Deus Ex - "every time someone mentions it, someone else'll reinstall it". :D
--
antiwittgenstein: Lulz. I still have Deus Ex and haven't installed it. I guess maybe I oughta soon...
