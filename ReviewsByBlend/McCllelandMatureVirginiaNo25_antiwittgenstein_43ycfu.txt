Tobacco Review: McClelland Mature Virginia No. 25
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 61

**Blend Name:** McClelland Mature Va No. 25
 
**Description on Tin:** Matured Virginia: No. 25 from McCllelland is a balanced mixture of the smoothest and most refined Red and Black aged Virginia cake tobaccos in a fully rubbed form.

**Leaf:** Very dark very short hefty bits. Like flake that was aggressively rubbed out.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Sweet, vanilla, prunes and raisins.

**Taste:** An almost Lakeland waxiness. Austere and restrained for the first dozen puffs or so. Charcoal. Then it grows sweet and tangy. Creamy and woodsy, almost like there was some Latakia in there. Very plummy. Very light vinegar and citrus. Something pleasantly bitter like wood char, cocoa, or coffee. Very dark flavors.  Smoking night. Kinda of elusive. Pecans. Growing cocoa and coffee and plums. Very restrained sweetness. Towards the end it gets spicy and even more rich. Elegant. The taste equivalent of velvet curtains. Plums married to oranges. Fresh nutmeg on top of cocoa and coffee again. This is a work of art. It makes me a bit melancholy when the last dottle gives its all.

**Nicotine:** Just past medium. Which is rather high for a Virginia flake.

**Smokability:** My sample was bone dry, in crunchy bits that gravity feed perfectly, fairly easy to light, fairly easy to keep going.
 
**Room Note:** Was the cigarette smoking man just here?

**Thoughts:** I am impressed. More impressed than I have been by a new blend in a long time. I have been eying this Mature Virginia line since even before I smoked my first bowl of Prince Albert. I am glad I have waited so long, so that my Virginia palate has developed and so I can appreciate how exceptionally good this blend is. If you are a Virginia smoker, you owe it yourself to try this out. 

**Late Edit:** I wrote all the above from the first 3 bowls of my 4 bowl sample. The last one though, the last was a doozy. It was wax and char all the way down. I was confused and very disappointed considering how transcendent my first bowls had been. It was out of the same pipe, the same pack, the same light. Just this time it was, well, bad. Not horrible enough to toss out, I kept smoking and smoking, hoping it would turn the corner as there was always a bit of a break in period before it turned sweet and tangy, but no, the cavalry never came. I am still very confused. I’ve had blends that were inconsistent before, but not so drastic from being close to the pinnacle of perfection to something I was happy to toss out unsmoked.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Dark Star, Blackwoods, Full Virginia Flake
 
**Summary:** A complex sweet-savoury dark Virginia that maybe can’t be trusted.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about two years ago. My current top three are: McClleland Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** +++++ and somehow also ---

Rating system (interpreted through numbers. Bear with me here. ):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (1984)

(++++) Great (Super 8)

(+++) Very good (The Hateful 8)

(++) Good (50/50)

(+) I think like it (12 Monkeys)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (12 Angry Men)

(-) I think I dislike this (7 Years in Tibet)

(--)This is not for me (The Legend of 1900)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (8MM)

(----)This is suffering (The Naked Gun 33 and 1/3)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Formula 51)

Thanks as again to the ever so generous /u/pixeechick for the sample!

====================================
Pandam: I always enjoy reading your reviews. In the beginning I come for your rating system, but I stay for the oddly specific descriptions you use for your flavors. I've gotta eat more velvet curtains...

I'd be interested in maybe getting your take on a few blends sometime in the future. I'm sure I have something lying around you'd be interested in trying!

SupraMario: Same here the reviews are great. Question for ant, do you smoke through a whole tin before writing the review or just a few bowls?

Just for clarification, I did see with this review you said 4 bowls, but others you don't mention how many bowls you had.
--
antiwittgenstein: It varies. To co-opt language from my day job, I smoke a blend until the experience converges. Or in the case of samples, if not convergence until I run out of iterations. The number of bowls varies widely from needing 20 or so bowls to figure out Billy Budd to needing half a bowl to know the lakeland poisoned travesty that is GH Dark Flake *Unscented* was a foretaste of hell.

I would say on average it takes me about half an ounce, say 7-10 bowls, to really understand a blend. If I really like it though I generally keep smoking it, because my usual practice is to put any remaining leaf back in my cellar once I put up the review, so I can move on to the next new blend. Yes that means I have close to 50 blends lying around waiting for my curiosity to circle back around.
--
SupraMario: Cool, I've got a little note book I bought and hope to begin to fill out one day, as like you my cellar probably have 50-70 different tobacco blends right now...
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks, I try to have fun with it and sometimes my memory gives odd associations. Yes I can do requests. I can even trade you something in return.

====================================
GanDuff: I think your last bowl may have been a product of how dry the tobacco was. I'm surprised that the first three bowl were that pleasant, given that you described the sample as being "bone dry". I think you ought to try a fresh tin of it, maybe it'll even be better than those first three bowls.
--
antiwittgenstein: Eh, I prefer my stoved  Va Flake this dry. Too many bad experiences with soping wet Blackwoods and Dark Star. So far, I haven't had any issue with it changing the palate, and it makes it so much more pleasant to smoke. If I bought a tin my first move would be to open the lid and let it dry out for a few weeks. Its the only way I can deal with these hydrophiliac McC flakes.
--
GanDuff: Well I wasn't saying that they should be smoked wet. A lot of blends need some drying time, but having a blend completely dry out can take away from the flavors it could otherwise impart. That was the point I was trying to make regarding why your last bowl may have tasted like that.

====================================
CaptainDickPuncher: Excellent review as usual. I always look forward to seeing your reviews on here.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks!
--
====================================
mapguy: Thanks for the review.  If what you say about the room note is true, I'm not sure I want to try this one indoors.
--
antiwittgenstein: So many Va flakes have a wretched room note.
--
mapguy: Thanks for the info.  I've been smoking exclusively latakia blends for the last few years.
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: Insightful, as always. Being a recent convert to the gospel of Dark Star, and perhaps to Blackwoods after the weather here warms a bit, I'm wondering how you think this compares to them, as it does sound very similar. Is it just an all around outstanding VA, with differences in the subtleties? Or is are differences very noticeable?
--
antiwittgenstein: This one is much less sweet, even when it does perform how I think it ought to. There are also more savory flavors. Blackwoods is much more tangy and varied in its flavors then the other two, Dark Star is much more narrow. And I never got the wax or ick from those other flakes either.
--
====================================
DarumaRed: Inspiring - I shamelessly stole your review structure for my Evernote tobacco notes notebook with some small revisions.
--
antiwittgenstein: I shamelessly stole it from the template made by /u/renholder so it is all fair. I just added in nicotine which I felt was missing, and pixee suggested I put in some similar tobaccos.
--
====================================
grilled_okra: I had a similar love/hate experience a while back with H&H Anniversary Kake. First couple-three bowls magical, heck I dedicated a pipe to the blend. Then I got one bowl that was just off (or probably more accurate, *something* was off). I haven't revisited it since, but I know I can learn to love it again....

I've read some people talk about mouth chemistry, and palate based on variations in recent blends you've smoked - I think that all these things and others (clean hands? sour pipe? scraping some dog hair into the bowl?) could impact a smoke. 

Maybe revisit after some time with other VAs, or ? Try, try, try again?

--
antiwittgenstein: Well that was the end of my sample. Through the 1st three bowls I was pretty sure I would buy a tin for myself, but now I am not so sure.
--
grilled_okra: ...Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back. 

~~Greener~~ Other pastures for the time-being at least?
