====================================
lord_garrett: First and foremost I would like to thank /u/Comintern for surprising me with a sample of this a few weeks ago. I wouldn’t have been able to do this review without you, buddy! 

Secondly I would like to apologize for the long windedness of this review! It’s my first one and I really wanted to be thorough. 

This is going to be a two bowl review. The first one I smoked out of a briar (Yello-Bole bent billiard) and the second out of my [Frankenclay](http://imgur.com/XJEumqo). 

Also be forewarned that there is at least one terribly off topic and gratuitous Monty Python reference contained herein. 

**Description on tin:**

(Brace for gratuitous melodrama…)

>You enter the dark paneled room, its walls lined with ancient books. An antique table stands beside a leather club chair. Upon it, next to a small silver coin, an open tobacco tin entices you with an aroma deep, rich, authentic. You fill your bowl, strike a match. The first puff stops time as the smoky magic weaves its spell... Sixpence. The mystery continues.

(Why?)

**Leaf:** 

It’s a broken flake, mostly dark brown and black with light brown and tan streaks. 

Kind of reminds me of the last bits of beef jerky in the bottom of the bag after you’ve eaten the rest. 

**Jar note:**

If I just had to pick two adjectives, those two would be “dark” and “sweet”. There is a hint of underlying “tobacco spiciness”. I remember the first good whiff I got when I opened the sample from /u/Comintern… It instantly reminded me of the Red Man my dad chewed when I was little. It had a similar spiciness to it. The smells aren’t the same - just reminiscent of each other. 

There is also a musty note in there that, when it melds with the aforementioned sweetness and spiciness, makes me think of damp, old pine straw. 

I’m not sure if I can detect the casing or not just from this. There is an unusual scent that I can’t quite put my finger on in there… Other reviews I’ve read state that the casing on this is a sweet liquer of some sort, so that may be what I’m detecting. I should note that I expect the casing to be much weaker on my ‘Pence, which I hear is for the better. My sample was both thoroughly dried (to the perfect moisture content, I might add) by /u/Comintern and then jarred for a while by myself. I’m not sure how long /u/Comintern had it cellared; perhaps he’ll chime in. 

**Taste:** 

At first light, something dark and… dare I say, bready?... makes itself known. It’s almost malty. The casing isn’t immediately apparent - I’d say it manifests itself more in its interplay with the perique. There is the lingering spice that I expect from perique, but accompanying it is a very subdued sweetness. Almost like I’d eaten a candied pepper five minutes ago. (If you’ve never had candied peppers, why the hell not?) One reviewer compared this tingly-sweet sensation to clove cigarettes. I don’t recall if they were talking about this tobacco or something else but I get it here too, and I quite like it. (Djarum Blacks were practically my only reason for my brief flirtation with cigarettes in my “rebellious teen” years.) Sometimes the malty/bready thing will dip in - then the flavor becomes something like malted milk powder, or malted milk balls (sans chocolate). It’s fleeting, but tasty.

About ⅔ left of the bowl, and the flavor deepens considerably. The sweetness is no longer sugary and playing with just the perique - now it’s a malty, toasty sweetness that’s all about the virginias.  Occasionally the sweetness bows out of the way and leaves me with a warm, enveloping flavor akin to baking bread or a beer in which toasted malts are the main player. Think brown ales, like Newcastle and the like. I think it’s exquisite. All this is supported by the mellow, creamy smoke and the perique tingling at the back of my palette. 

Down to the final third of the bowl. I get this interesting spicy, peppery, deep, dark musty thing going on… there are even hints of salt wisping through here and there, strangely enough. It’s like someone snuck in and replaced my candied peppers with chipotles preserved in olive oil. Is this the dark fired, I wonder? The flavors are the darker, more intense versions of what came before. The malts from brown ales have become those from porters or stouts. The fresh baked bread is now a week old crust of dark rye used to sop up the last bit of chili from the bottom of your bowl. There’s a nice dark roasted coffee note that I get too. I like it just fine. Just fine indeed. 

**Smokeability:**

I found this to be really quite smokeable. Overall, it was creamy and smooth. I even *tried* to make it unfriendly but I just couldn’t do it. Let me explain:

I ended up having to take a phone call about ⅓ of the way through my first bowl of this. I decided to give it a 2-3 minute rest and relight when I got off the phone. When I came back I decided to really ramp up the smoke and see if I could get it to bite. For science! I puffed and puffed until my match was almost burning my fingertips, but nope. No bite at all. 

The volume of smoke was huge though. It was quite remarkable in both smoking sessions. If you really try to get it going, you can spit clouds like those guys on the youtubes who have custom vape boxes. The really interesting part is that the smoke isn’t all that unpleasant or harsh when it’s like this either. 

I would also like to point out that this burned for a long time for me. About 30-50% longer than I’m used to out of the two pipes I smoked it in. I got like 45 minutes instead of the usual 30 minutes from my Frankenclay, and over an hour when I’m used to 45-50 minutes in my Yello-Bole Imperial. 

Oh, one more thing. This tobacco expands a lot when you light it - and I mean that. It straight up tried to crawl out of my bowl twice. Two charring lights and tamps were necessary with my clay and three with the briar. 

**Nicotine potency:**

I would like to temper these statements by first warning you that I’m a nicotine wimp and you should hear what I have to say with that in mind. 

It’s a little stout for me. It rang my head, but it wasn’t, “SURPRISE! Go throw up now. :)” kind of nic hit. Think of it like a cymbal crescendo rather than someone ringing a gong. I just leaned back in my chair, breathed for a bit, and waited for my meal to digest some more. 

**Room note:** 

The first time I smoked this I was outside so I can’t comment on the room note much from that time. 

The second time I was in my car, and that got much more interesting. 

There was, of course, the backbone of a typically “sweet pipe tobacco” scent. I guess the casing may have had something to do with it. There was also this really [nice woody sort of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwXJsWHupg) scent. Sort of like a stack of old firewood or the inside of a log cabin. 

Here’s where things get weird though. 

I was smoking in my car and listening to NPR, which lead to me being somewhat distracted and letting my pipe go out a couple of times. On relight, I quickly got scents of… gunpowder. Not  smokeless powder as is used in modern firearms cartridges, but the stuff in fireworks. Strange. And then, about ½ through the bowl I started, every now and then, getting wisps of none other than our old pal Grapico. Both of these were odd, but not unpleasant. 

**Recommended to:**

Someone who reads this review and says, “Hey, that sounds pretty good!” 

**Summary, aka TL;DR:**

Warm, malty smoke with various natural flavors that develop steadily throughout the bowl. Mr. Pease has not let me down yet. Perfect Autumn or Winter smoke. I’d love to take it on vacation in the mountains. 

**Rating:** ++++

antiwittgenstein: Well done review, very through. Excellent rating list.

Comintern: Nice review /u/lord_garrett very thorough. I'm glad you put one up. The tin was only a couple months old when I popped it open and since then it's been in the jar periodically opened and smoked for about 5 months. 

I'll probably put up my review after work but I'm right there with you I love this stuff.
--
lord_garrett: Awesome! Thanks again, sir. 

I'll be looking forward to hearing what you have to say about it as well.

====================================
naughty_corner: So I smoked a tin of this over the spring/summer (and have about two very dry bowlfuls left in a jar).  I also have a fresh tin that I've just cracked for comparison.

Fresh Tin Note: Right away a little bit of ketchup smell.  Not anything near the McClelland VA smell, but it's there (and not a bad thing).  Beneath that are notes of liqueur and raisin bread.  Probably more, but I'm a bit stuffy at the moment. 

Old Jar Note: Earthy hay smell.  Like if I tried to make an adobe brick with garden soil.  I want to say it smells a bit like a petting zoo, but that's both gross and inaccurate.  I think the most similar scent I can think of is the pellet food you feed to pet rabbits or guinea pigs.

While I smoked it through the spring/summer I kept it in its tin and took it outside with me in the hot (but not too humid) Upstate South Carolina weather.  It dried (in tin) pretty quickly over the time that it would stay out with me.  So each day was a bit of a different taste as it dried.

There was a sweet spot that it hit where the topping had lost some (but not all) of its flavor from drying.  As it continued to dry out, the liquor flavors vanished.  It was kinda fun to smoke it this way and see the flavors change.

The broken flakes were pretty easy to rub out when fresh, but as it dried they turned into wood chips.  I hate broken flakes because rubbing them out causes my arthritis to flare up, and I don't care to be reminded that I'm arthritic.  I wish this were just ready rubbed or sliced into a proper flake so I could fold-and-stuff and be done with it.  Which is why I'll be rubbing out this new tin before stuffing it into the jar.

Overall, I enjoy this blend. I think the added Kentucky and liquor top dressing bring in some interesting flavors into what could otherwise be a run-of-the-mill VA/Per, and there's a lot of subtly (for me) to pick through while smoking a bowl.

I'd give it a solid 3 out of 4 stars, even with the annoyance of the broken flake.

====================================
J_piper33: The first couple bowls that I smoked of this blend i was unimpressed. Despite this I stuck with the blend and continued to experiment with it in different pipes. The more i smoked it the more I started to enjoy it. By the end of my first tin I fell in love with it. Traditionally C&D/GL Pease tobaccos tend to be very young compared to say McClelland tobaccos. With that being said I will be eagerly stocking up on this blend to see how it will age. I have now smoked several tins and eagerly give this blend a 4 out of 4 star rating.

====================================
crimsonrat: The tin note smells like some sort of plum liqueur or something along those lines. Not sickly sweet, but something along the lines of a dried date.

The broken flake rubs out really easily, and mine was even a bit dry, making it burn a little quickly. Then last half to 1/3 of the bowl was the best, after the topping had burnt away and the tobacco in the bottom had time to stove from the leaf burning above. Fairly deep and complex, the perique was there, but not in the quantity as in something along the lines of Haddo's. I like it, but I'm not in love with it. It's like a broken flake Cumberland with a topping. It's always worth trying, but I won't be stocking up the cellar like a madman: 3.5/5
--
_troubadour: I find its best after jarred for a while, and even dried out a little. The topping was a little too strong/tangy for me right out of the tin.
--
lord_garrett: The sample I got from /u/Comintern was both. The topping went away almost entirely. I liked it.

chewsyourownadv: > The tin note smells like some sort of plum liqueur or something along those lines. 

It's a neat combination, a bourbon topping mixing well with the typical dried fruit notes of a VaPer. I'm a fan.
--
====================================
Mordenkrad: Heh. Leroy. No wonder he uses L instead.

I've got nothing inventive to say about it besides the fact that it's a solid VaPer that's sweeter and fruitier due to GL. Pease toppings. It's good. I also agree with /u/crimsonrat, it's cumberland with a aromatic topping and I think cumberland's the better blend.

2/4. Buy some if you like VaPers, but this won't change your mind on the style itself.

Comintern: **GL Pease Six Pence**

**Technique** 

I've smoked this blend every way I could think of. I've stuffed the broken flakes as is and rubbed it out but by far my favourite way is to give the flakes a nice cube cut and gravity fill.

It lights well, smokes well and generally behaves itself.

I've never experience tongue bite with this blend but that generally doesn't count for much as I expect that of any quality blend

**Weapon of Choice**

I almost always smoke it in my J&J Pipes Sierra Dublin nosewarmer with a narrow bowl.

**Tin Note**

Just gave it a whiff. For me I get a pretty standard VA/Per nose. Some grassy, hay like virginia notes with some dried fig or raisin like perique notes. But you also get a whiff of the dark fired which to me adds something somewhere between a BBQ and a barnyard.

**Taste**

This blend really shines with it's dark virginia notes and light hints of Dark Fired Kentucky savouriness mixed in with the fruity perique.
It's a largely virginia based blend and it mostly tastes of it but you get tantilizing savoury hints of kentucky hanging around as well. 

The aroma of the smoke is mostly grassy virginia but you tend to get darker earthy flavours rather than the grassy and citrusy notes of brighter Virginias. Although I find the lower you get in the bowl the Virginias come out even more.


I don't know if it's me or my particular tin of Sixpence but I really do not get a lot of the sweet spirit topping people talk about. I might have dried mine out. There's a hint of an anise like flavour at times but that's about it.

**Verdict**

I actually didn't like this one much at first. But I found I kept reaching for this jar more than any other and it grew on me enough to take the top spot. This is my favourite blend and while I'm normally a big fan of variety I could smoke this every day without complaint. So far this is my desert island blend although there are still a lot of blends in the world left to try.

====================================
vivalanation734: I haven't smoked this blend in about 4-6 months, but all I can say is that I was incredibly disappointed by it and that it sucked. I'm not sure if it was the topping that put me off or what, but I could never get past the first 1/3 of the bowl without being overwhelmed by acrid flavors. 

I give it a 2 out of 4. I would give it a 1 out of 4, but I know people love it and Greg is legit, so he gets a free point for that.
