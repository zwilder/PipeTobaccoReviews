Tobacco Review : MacBaren's Vanilla Flake
By: Jaxx2112
---
**Blend Name:** MacBaren Vanilla Flake

**Description on Tin:** "A flake tobacco of select matured Virginia and mild Black Cavendish tobaccos, rounded off with an aromatic vanilla flavor. This combination gives an unusual blend with a pleasing sweetness and a special taste."

**Leaf/Cut:**   To say this tobacco is pretty would be an understatement.  The tobacco is presented within a small rectangular 50g tin.  And when I say a small tin, I mean it.  The tin is at most, 2.5’’x1.5’’x1’’ compared to the standard 3''x2''x1''.  When I first opened the tin, I expected to find 30g of tobacco.  In actuality, the full 50g of tobacco is presented wonderfully.  Packed tightly and compactly, this is a flake that I could watch for hours.  The cavendish is woven into the virginia with a very tight grain.  The flake holds together well until the 2nd fold when it starts to crumble and separate into ribbons.  The tobacco comes a little bit on the damp side, so let it sit out for a little bit before you smoke it.  

**Tin Aroma:**   Oddly enough, the tin smells of fig newtons.  No, seriously, stay with me.  The initial note is vanilla, with subtle undertones of dried fruit, in this case, figs.  The result is that the tin initially smells like the sweetness you get from opening a box of fig newtons, followed by the actual figs beneath the pastry/cookie goodness.

**Taste:**  The charring light doesn’t really bring a whole lot of flavours.  The vanilla is there, but rather muted and subtle against the virginia base.  After the relight though, you are greeted with a promising sweetness and vanilla.  As the bowl progresses, the vanilla intensifies and comes forward.  After a certain time, the vanilla notes begins to die down, and the tobacco beneath presents itself.  You are rewarded with a notes of fig and dried fruit, accompanied by the vanilla, not masked by it.  The vanilla acts to accent to the tobacco beneath, rather than covering it up.  Around the last third of the bowl, the vanilla dissipates and you are left with that fruity virginia base.  

**Room Note:** Overall quite pleasant, the room note tends to spread quickly.  Notes of vanilla are present, and it is definitely a sweet smelling tobacco.  Post smoke room note consists of sweetness and vanilla.

**Smokability:** The best way to describe this smoke would be to say that it demands your attention.  Attention to how you pack, attention to how you light, and attention to how often you are puffing.  If left to your own devices, it’s very easy for this to turn into a bitter, harsh, flavorless  tobacco.  When nurtured, this tobacco really comes into its own.  It’s important to understand that nurtured isn’t necessarily the same as babied in this instance.  Smoked in a relaxed environment, where time isn’t a worry, this tobacco really delivers on a quality aromatic experience.  The kind of experience where vanilla marries with fig and presents itself in a unique way.  This tobacco responds well to relights and short breaks, and has given me evidence to assume that a minor DGT of say 30 minutes to an hour may enhance the flavours.  When left to its own devices for 40 minutes while I battled the parking authority, the vanilla seemed more prominent and the figs mellowed.  This is the kind of tobacco that when it burns hot, it’s best to simply set it down for 20 minutes and try again.  Persistence and stubbornness will make you hate this tobacco.  Overall, it’s smokability is hard to judge-- yes, it requires a fair amount of attention, but in the preferred environment for pipe smokers (i.e. relaxed, preferably with a drink, a leather chair and a good book) it shouldn’t be too unreasonable to ask for this.  

**Thoughts:** With an aromatic like Vanilla Flake, it’s very easy for me to say what annoys me and what doesn’t.  I dislike how much attention this blend can require for what it delivers.  That being said, when paid attention to, this is a wonderful smoke.  Complexity isn’t necessary lacking in this blend, but it can be difficult to ascertain what flavours are to be expected and when.  This blend initially walks the line between aromatic and virginia quite well, but as it continues and the topping evaporates/combusts, you are left with what is just a decent virginia.   That being said, when the blend performs well, it really sets the bar for vanilla aromatics.  It is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming, and works with the virginia present to provide a wonderful complementary experience.  Despite MacBaren’s pitfalls, Vanilla Flake bites the least of any MacBaren aromatics i’ve smoked, and provides some of the best flavor.  Vanilla Flake is without a doubt lightyears ahead of its Vanilla Cream ready rubbed counterpart.
 
**Smoked In:** Missouri Meerschaum Country Gentleman with a 6/8’’ bore and a Meerschaum pipe with a 5/8’’ bore.  Of the two, the narrower Meerschaum made the virginia base stand out more and the vanilla appeared muted.  I would stick to 6/8’’ or even go as far as 7/8’’ with this tobacco-- narrow enough to concentrate the virginias present, but wide enough to allow the topping to combust properly.

**Fire Used:**  Angled flame Tsubota Pearl Eddie (old boy style) lighter.

**Packing Method:**  While I tried both folding and stuffing the flake (z-pack) as well as rubbing it out, the fold and stuff method results in a more consistent, heavier vanilla flavour.  Rubbing out this tobacco just felt like muting the vanilla flavor, which is the sole purpose to choose this tobacco in the first place.

**Recommend to:** Aromatic Smokers and anyone looking for a change of pace.   I'd highly recommend this tobacco to anyone looking for a beautifully executed vanilla aromatic.

**Summary:**  MacBaren aromatics tend to get a horrible wrap.  They are weak in taste, and when they are flavorful, they bite like a dog being castrated.  MacBaren's vanilla flake however, is the exception to the rule.  It's vanilla is subtle yet pronounced, but doesn't overwhelm the virginia base.  This ***is*** a danish style aromatic, so those expecting sickly sweet, sticky tobacco should look elsewhere. Yes, this tobacco will bite you if you puff like a madman, but (relatively)patient sipping is rewarded with a mouthful of flavor.  Overall, this tobacco is a fantastic example of how to do an aromatic right.  If it wasn't as prone to biting as it is and held up better towards the end of the smoke, i'd rate it higher.  I give this aromatic a 4.5 out of 5.


**Would I buy a Pound of it?:**  Personally, the tastes do not align with what i’m focusing on.  That being said, if i were an Aro smoker-- i’d buy a pound of this in a heartbeat.

**Value:**  At $6.12 a 50g tin online, this tobacco is reasonably priced at $3.50 an ounce.  While it may not be dirt cheap, it’s definitely an affordable baccy to stock up on.

**My Background:** I’ve been a pipe smoker since 2010.  I’ve run the gamut between styles and have settled (for now) on Virginias, VaPers, Aro-English and Burley blends.  Occasionally, as the mood/environment requires, I’ll smoke aromatic blends.  My staples as of this review are LJ Peretti’s Park Square, Hal O the Wynd, Carter Hall and Peter Stokkebye’s Luxury Twist.

ubergeekking: I thought it was just me who smelled fig newtons!
--
Jaxx2112: It took me 9 months to place it, and then BAM! Fig Newtons.
--
Jordoom: I smoke Mac Baren Original Choice primarily, and it smells extremely like figs.   I've never smoked an aromatic yet, though.  I want to try this one.  
--
orgchem17: The first time I opened my tin of the loose cut version of this blend, I thought of fig newtons also. On that note, it's been a few weeks since I've picked up any of my pipes. I should really catch up on some reading and pipe smoking.

mjtski: Is it just me or does it seem that most Mac Baren blends can lend a challenging smoke? 

Not bad but can turn bitter quickly.

Great review!

JEDISMOKE27: the problem is that almost every blend that mac baren makes has a topping of sugar syrup. and with the added flavor of aromatics adds to much sugar. there blends are best enjoyed in smaller bowls or try some of their non aero blends.

====================================
SteepedinTruth: Thanks for the review. I tried this tobacco about a month ago, and I couldn't really enjoy it. I think I may have been packing my pipe too loosely in retrospect. I also noticed that it dried out in the tin way faster than I would have expected. Did you have a similar experience in regards to drying out?   
--
Jaxx2112: Not really, but I did jar it up within a month of cracking it open.  I hope you can revisit this baccy like I did and give it another shot, it definitely demands your attention.
--
SteepedinTruth: Inclined to do so, perhaps next paycheck. I had a feeling I wasn't getting the most out of it while smoking it, just couldn't get it down before I ran out.

====================================
BaconBeerJoy: I was smoking some of this tobacco that you sent me at almost the same time you posted this! I enjoyed the smoke and even had a couple of compliments while I was in a cigar lounge. Thanks man! You have a much more discerning palette than I do... Maybe some day I can taste all the things you do in tobacco!
