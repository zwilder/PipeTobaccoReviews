Tobacco Review: Savinelli Brunello Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 101

**Blend Name:** Savinelli Brunello Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** An impeccably structured blend, Savinelli's Brunello Flake features a foundation of sweet, tangy Virginias and cool burning Burleys. A dash of Macedonian leaf is added to round out the mixture and add a hint of the exotic. The different leafs are then aged as one, in order to marry and harmonize flavor, prior to being pressed into a tantalizing flake.

**Leaf:** Medium tan flakes. We are told it is Virginia, Burley, and Macedonian Leaf.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisin Bran, light cocoa

**Age when smoked:** About 2 years.

**Taste:** Sweet hay…and…and Worcestershire sauce! That is surprising and encouraging. Big plummy notes come out of the pipe. Strangely, no citrus. This reminds me more of a dark stoved blend or two. After the first quarter, smoky char, clean wood char like from a smoky style bourbon. Some earth and leather come with the presence of the oriental, which tastes more like Latakia. The burley shows now too, adding a subtle nutty-cocoa note which is happy to stay in the shadows unless you go looking for him. Now the citrus comes, not as intense as the plums but distinctly orange. Reminds me a bit of Star of the East at this point. After not too long, it veers back towards Virginia, plummy, haylike, now with the citrus and a light char – and the fish sauce taste as well from time to time. An occasional burst of incense comes from the oriental which is otherwise to the background. In the final third, it turns dark, smoke, burley, and plums singing in near harmony.

**Nicotine:** 4-5. I was taken aback by the strength until I found out it wasn’t just VA in there.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** This doesn’t smoke well straight from the tin, being too moist to stay properly lit, though it feels just right. So as is my wont I over dried it to tobacco crisps, which is usually how I tell McC or SG flakes whose boss. It still didn’t stay lit. So, to do what Golidlocks should have done if she had proper understanding of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, I tried using about half of the over dried shake peppered instead a folded and stuffed flake. It was remarkable, it not only lit and stayed lit much better, it also brought forth a better flavor.
 
**Side Stream:** Tobacco, some light fruit and incense notes.

**Thoughts:** This was a weird fish to gut. When I first popped this thing open months back, I smoked it a few times, struggling with the mechanics a bit, and was unimpressed by the flavor. More of the Rest as the scotchies like to say. But I have to give it a fair shake to review it so I pressed on, and was glad I did.

It is a tobacco of two parts, but not two halves. That first third or so is a great replacement for all of you yenning for another taste of Dark Star. It is not quite the same, it isn’t as close as FVF is, but it is playing some of the same chords. But then it sheds its mild mannered nature and transitions, quite abruptly, into a very intriguing mild English, one with the Virginia still on display and the Lat not overpowering everything, but still an English blend. So if you are really just a VA smoker, look elsewhere – or smoke this in your smallest bowl.

And about the McKetchup flavor. It is distinctly there at the beginning. I wonder if it is from the Virginias, or perhaps the light touch of oriental?
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** 1st 3rd: FVF, Darkstar, 2nd & 3rd 3rd McC Contest Blend, C&D Star of the East, H&H 10 to Midnight 
 
**Summary:** Starts as a saucy plummy Virginia, transitions into a mildly smoky English

**My Background** I have been regular cigar smoker about 5 years, and entered the world of pipes about 4 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
carnesy: To me it smells like strawberries and teddy grahams. Flavor is good but also fairly light. It's gonna be a good summer smoke, but right now it's still a little to chilly for a light bodied smoke.
--
jvpeap: Same with me on the strawberries, plus a little sour-ish note also.
--
antiwittgenstein: Y'all smoke this fresh or aged to get that teddy grahms and strawberries.
--
cmdr_andrew_dermott: Fresh. Grahm cracker goodness. Way a powdered sugar donut with it and you've got smores. 
--
jvpeap: Freshly opened 3 year old tin. I’ve got half of it in a jar with an extra 8 months on it since I opened it.
--
====================================
VilaFrancaWeimar: Great review! Unfortunatelly by the end you reminded me of the existence of "Meet the Fockers" and I just got really sad. Then, I discovered there is a third movie called "Little Fockers", and now I gotta watch it to just see how absolutely terrible it can be.

Brunello flake seems very pleasant, though.
--
antiwittgenstein: My condolences. I never saw the 3rd film. The first one had a bit of charm, crude as it was, but the follow up was a waste of time and talent.
--
====================================
Matsutake_slayer: I think that you overrated Meet the Fockers by several orders of magnitude.
--
====================================
professor_throway: Excellent review as always my friend.
--
====================================
zero-hunter: Brunello is one of my favorites. Just a completely unique blend that hits all the buttons: VA, burley, oriental. I also get strawberries, but more than anything else I taste graham crackers and honey. I find that, like even the best Brunello wines, decanting it (i.e., rubbing it out) amps the flavor (and makes it easier to light). I'm still working my way through my first ever tin, and I've got another from 2014 brewing in the cellar. Glad to read you too enjoyed it
--
antiwittgenstein: Did you smoke yours fresh? I've read this thing is supposed to be topped with honey, but with 2 years on this stuff there was already nothing of it left.
--
zero-hunter: If I can recall (I no longer have the tin), I think it was popped fresh. It's spent time in the jar though, and the honey is still around. I have read where age mellows this out perhaps a bit more than needed. I've never had it aged, so I don't know. Mine didn't remind me much of Dark Star, so I'm wondering if the similarity you're picking up on is due to aging.
--
====================================
KingOTheJungle: I had this on my drive in to work this morning. I find it smokes nicely more on the dry side, and with a couple years age. Love this stuff. 
--
====================================
boomermax: I prefer shredding a flake with an herb grinder and packing it a tad on the moist side.
--
zero-hunter: I still gotta get me a grinder for those McC flakes. Right now, I'm pulsing them in a coffee grinder, and that works but...ya know, now I can't grind my coffee beans in it
--
boomermax: The grinders work well because you have better control over how coarse or fine
