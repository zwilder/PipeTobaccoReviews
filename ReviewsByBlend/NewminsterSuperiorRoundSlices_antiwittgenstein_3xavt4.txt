Review #57

**Blend Name:** Newminster No. 403 Superior Round Slices

**Description on Tin:** Newminster No. 403 Superior Round Slices starts with a core of dark-fired Kentucky, around which premium flue-cured leaves are wrapped and spun into a rope. It's sliced into coins that are very easy to prepare. The flavor is typically sweet Virginia with an undertone that's spicy and slightly smoky - slightly on the full side of medium bodied.
 
**Leaf:** Pretty little loose coins about the size of a quarter. Yellow and brown on the perimeter, dark in the center.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisin bran.
 
**Taste:** Sharp citrusy Virginia. I think it might be biting a bit or it is Perique or maybe I don’t care. Plenty of Kentucky lovin’ here. Smoky, dense burley. Woodsy and piney. Some more traditional unsmoked burley flavors here, nutty, funky, musty. Has a bit of that classic C&D taste too it, like Old Joe Krantz exudes. There is just enough sweetness from the Virginia to testify to how dry the Kentucky is. This is not a pipe tobacco for children or sweetteeth. This is the kind of tobacco that keeps its tire iron in the passenger seat. Rotating bursts of spice, smoky and floral at the same time. Depending on your pack you might play tobacco roulette here. It can change moods from a lemon-vinegar tang to a sooty leather boot to a chili eating contest to a multigrain bread in the space of a couple of puffs. Or as the bowl progresses and burns and marries, a single puff can be lemon up front and burnt dreams on the end. This is for Ardbeg whisky fans. An excellent cold weather, black mood, punch a stranger in throat kind of blend. I think I am in love and maybe have a masochistic streak. Cigar like at the end. Earthy and deep and rich. 

**Nicotine:** Moderate. Heavy for a Virginia but light for a Dark Fired blend.

**Smokability:** Eeeh. You are gonna get some relights.  I smoke this a bit moister than is my wont, because I was pretty excited about smoking this. Future bowls might be better. Has both a touch of bite and gives you a bit of burley mouth, so if you are sensitive in the mouth area, this could be a rough ride for you.
 
**Room Note:** Surprisingly good. Bready and sweet with just a faint tobacco note.

**Thoughts:** I needed a quiet angry smoke for a horrible work week and this is a perfect companion. Heavy enough to settle my nerves but not so that I have to bring the sick pail out. Sweet enough to satisfy that need but brooding and solitary. I’ve had only three Newminster tobaccos, this, the Imperial Nougat which is a bit blah, and Superior Navy Flake, which isn’t bragging, it is telling the truth. So far, it is batting 0.600. Or like Sutliff, maybe I should stick to the Non-Aromatics.

Dark Fired. It is a category of tobacco I don’t often turn to, mostly I think because of my early experience with Peterson’s Irish Flake. I couldn’t get it to smoke and when I could, I was a green mess. But those that I have tried, (3 out of the 4, being like this one, from /u/pixeechick – thanks again!) I have liked. I reckon I need to delve deeper into this. And maybe confront that Irish Flake one more time now that I have my big boy pants on.

The only other coins I have had thus far (sorry Escudo fans) are the PS Bullseye Flakes. These are similar in their strength, but quite different in their attitude. The Bullseye has a Cavendish core, a sweet respite in the middle of the heavy Virginia-Burley battle. In the Round Slices, the Virginia is a lady’s glove wrapped around a roll of quarters. It is gonna hurt but you deserve it and maybe you kinda wanted it.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Savinelli Dublone D’oro, MM Country Gentleman, Haddo’s Delight. Really any Va-Bur-DFK-Perique blend you have had.  

**Summary:** A fun Va-Bur-Dark Fired round slice covered in dark thoughts and smoke.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
tennesseean_87: I found this had a decent-nice flavor, but bit more than most blends. There are other DFK blends I prefer (Exhausted Rooster, Triple Play, ODF), so it's not one I'll buy again. 
--
antiwittgenstein: I will put those on my list to try. You might not have meant to give me suggestions but they are mine now and you can't have them back.
--
tennesseean_87: haha. They are some good ones. ODF may be my all-time favorite blend.

====================================
hedonaut: I like this stuff but it doesn't like me. The flavor was lovely for when I'm into something sweeter than my typical burleys, but it bit me like a weasel. I bought a whole box anyway and packed it away in the cellar to see if a year doesn't make it friendlier. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Yeah, I noticed the bite, but I have a semi-leather tongue. I don't know how long /u/pixeechick had this before she sent it over, so I can't really help with timing.
--
pixeechick: Well, I'll have to check my cellar notes to be certain, but this one's probably near a year with regular opening to it. 

That said, she doesn't bite me, which is amazing. I have a fairly sensitive mouth, but this one doesn't give me any trouble. I do tend to dry this one quite a while- sometimes overnight- and smoke it in cobs exclusively, as it's a bit of a wet smoke in my experience and cobs have kept it driest to date.  That's my $.02, FWIW.

====================================
SupraMario: Your reviews are excellent, keep up the great work.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. I was in a foul mood and smoking and writing this up really cheered me. Very cathartic.
--
SupraMario: No problem a good smoke is always a win in calming me down

Haha, that is perfect. Might have to order some just based off of that .
