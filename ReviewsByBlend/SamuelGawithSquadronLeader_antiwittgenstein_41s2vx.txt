Review # 59

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith Squadron Leader
 
**Description on Tin:** Squadron Leader from Samuel Gawith is a classic English blend named in honor of the men who flew in the two World Wars. Bright and Dark Virginias are blended with Latakias and Turkish to offer a medium strength smoke with a subtle nutty flavor mixing with those of the Orient make this a cool smoke suited to casual puffing or an all day smoke

**Leaf:** Mottled tan standard ribbon, fairly dry to the touch.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Sweet and smoky. Almost jammy. Very inviting.

**Taste:** Creamy and leather. Slighty tangy, vinegar and citrus. Nutty and a bit sweet. A little spicy swung together with some salt and savoury elements. The cream dominates. Orange bubbles up underneath creating an Orange Julius effect. The flavors synch together, sharp, salty, and spicy, quite complex. Some Latakia, very light, bringing a lavender taste and touch of smoke. This is not an English quite up to the brutality of January, but for say, a damp March day. Only a bit of Latakia Soap, much better than say, Early Morning Pipe. Creamy leather belt soup and walnuts. Sharpness of the vinegar and spice again, which floats up and subsides into the creamy-nuttiness in sinusoidal wave. The cream-nut has an almost cigar like quality. 

**Nicotine:** Moderate, but low for and Latakia blend.

**Smokability:** Easy enough. It might feel dry, but does a bit better with some time out on the plate.
 
**Room Note:** Smoky and tobacco. Again light for an Latakia blend.

**Thoughts:** Squadron Leader is a classic English blend and for good reason. Of the Latakia blends outside of Dunhill’s range this is one of the most famous, well liked, and often talked about. It is approachable yet still complex, combining the facets of the modern English blend in a way that makes it a great first English and a blend that even the most seasoned smokers will return to year after year. As of now, I will think of Squadron Leader as a touchstone Blend, one which surmises what a genre is and thus can be used as a point of reference and comparison, in the same way as Ole Joe Krantz and Prince Albert do for Burleys, or Orlik Golden Sliced does for Virginia. 

A note here about moisture level and taste is in order. I was out of jars when I received this,  having just one small jar left, which fit about half of the tobacco. The other half I smoked from the bag over a number of months. Like a heathen I know. Interestingly, the drier the tobacco, the less cream was presented and more citrus-vinegar-oriental came out. It was still delicious, but since I think of the essence of this blend is that heavy cream, something was lost. But if you don’t go for cream in your bowl, a little patience can rectify that for you. And I am beginning to wonder if other blends can also be altered this way.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** John Bull, Dunhill 965, C&D Mountain Camp.
 
**Summary:** A deeply creamy, light on the smoke Latakia blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
1atomicsquid: i love the rating system for this, haha. great review!

====================================
forwormsbravepercy: Do people really not like Up?
--
antiwittgenstein: It was emotionally scarring not just the 1st ten minutes, which are some of the most emotionally manipulative in all of film history, but the rest of the movie is almost as upsetting.
--
====================================
damadfaceinvasion: (-------------)Soul Plane
--
antiwittgenstein: I only allow things I have actually seen. Luckily I avoided that one.
--
====================================
carnesy: No Tora! Tora! Tora! on the scale? Was Hot Shots (the Charlie Sheen parody, right) an aeronautic movie? Also called it on the Con Air placement.
--
antiwittgenstein: Yeah, a spoof of Top Gun. It was pretty awful.
--
carnesy: Huh... Could have sworn I'd seen both. Part 2 must have been the only one that stuck with me after all. Still Part 1 couldn't have been worse than his god awful Navy Seals movie.
--
Pipezilla: wasn't it "Part Deux"
--
====================================
erkpikII: What! No Battle of Britain on the rating system!
--
antiwittgenstein: I sadly haven't seen it. There were really dozens of movies that I thought of that didn't make the list. I will find another flight themed tobacco to review.

boomer56: Yeah I noticed that with this blend as well, and was interested to see someone else had the same experience. I know that damp blends will have their flavor dulled, but SL seemed to have a weird extra gear when it dried out.

====================================
phonkubot: Hey, I liked Hot Shot :) Hot Shots 2 however...Simply topping review!

tankbuster183: Great description, an all day English.  I started with Dunhill blends, and when I saw how many times this was reviewed in various places, I had to try it.  I was a little underwhelmed, but I think starting off with 965, a lot of blends seemed weak to me.  I really thought it benefited from drying (like most tinned tobaccos).

====================================
claypainter: I've been exploring Squadron Leader this last month, and I agree with your overall review. Though to be fair, you are pulling notes and complexities in the taste that I haven't been able to pick up on. I do get the cream and spice though.
--
antiwittgenstein: After nearly 60 reviews, I've got a pretty well tuned palate. Focusing to write these things really brings a level of clarity that just smoking a bowl, no mater how intently, just cannot match. I cannot suggest you making your own reviews highly enough.
--
====================================
Kuraito: (-----) should be The Last Airbender movie. It still sorta works.

Also, good review. I might sit down and try some next time I have the chance. I've only tried Commonwealth from Sam Gawith, and it was a seriously heavy blend. Squadron Leader seems much more relaxing.

dog_in_the_vent: Upvote for Memphis Belle.

*Vee tink you are tvying to escape!*

====================================
damadfaceinvasion: Just picked up a tin of this and I've had a totally different experience. I don't pick up any vineger or citrus notes. In fact I don't find it very complex at all. It just kind of alternates between straight, sweet grassy virginias (very nice VAs I might add) and smoky Latakia, with a very sutble floral note (Orientals maybe.) There is a little bit of tongue bite that's there if I puff it but it's very slight and doesn't burn at all. I'd say it's more VA forward than Lat forward, but definitely an English blend. The room note is very mild and actually quite pleasent, it gives off more of a sweet VA smell with a hint of Latakia and doesn't linger in the room. This is a great English for smoking indoors and definitely an "all day" smoke.  It's kind of the yin to Frog Morton's yang. FM being a mild Lat forward English, and SL being a mild more VA centric English. It's not anything mindblowing or anything, but I definitely enjoy it.  Also my tin was anything but dry. I've left it out drying for hours on end and I still have some trouble getting it to stay lit. A great beginners blend if you ask me.
