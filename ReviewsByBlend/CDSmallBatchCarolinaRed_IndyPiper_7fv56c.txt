REVIEW - C&D Small Batch Carolina Red
By: IndyPiper
---
**Tin Description** - A blend of the finest North Carolina grown red Virginias, harvested in 2015, our Carolina Red Flake is a tribute to the Old Belt. Plucked straight from Carolina soil, these top-tier Virginias were all grown, thrashed, blended, pressed, and then lovingly sliced and tinned right here in the heart of old tobacco country.  Sweet, tangy, and spicy, Carolina Red Flake is both surprisingly straightforward and pleasantly complex: you'll find it's rich, deep, and earthy, with undertones of dried cranberries, orchard grass, and citrus. We're proud of our heritage—and we're particularly proud of this damn near perfect red Virginia flake. Enjoy!  

**Tin Note** - The traditional Virginia sweetness of hay hits you right away and does not end.     

**Moisture Content** - Perfect out of the tin.  No need to dry.  

**Visual Note** - Red flake with light brown spots mixed throughout.  I would compare the color overall to a brick red color.  

**Smoke** - Medium smoke with a pleasent room note.  The hay sweetness is very prominent.  Makes for a really enjoyable smoke.  I got some spice from it in the back of my throat.  It was pleasent and I am not a big fan of VaPers.  I also got dried, dark fruit tastes. My brain went to a dark cherry flavor.  It was not overpowering and lingured on the tongue between draws.

**TL:DR** - Great medium, sweet smoke with a little spice and dark fruit flavors.  It has been pretty limited.  Only 2400 tins produced. I was able to grab a few tins, so I am smoking one and aging others.

simplechef: I just hope this batch doesn't end up like the last batch.

freepancakesforall: Yep. C&D didn’t lose me as a customer thanks to their stellar customer service in response to this. Still love trying their new blends. But I’ll probably never go deep one of their Virginia blends again.

piping_presbyter: Desert island: this or 40th?

IndyPiper: For me, 40th. Only reason is because 40th is milder so I could smoke more of it.
