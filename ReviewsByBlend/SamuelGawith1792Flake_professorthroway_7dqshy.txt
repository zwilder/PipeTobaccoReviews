**Samuel Gawith 1792 flake**

* Description on Tin: Dark Kendal Flake
Description on Smokingpipes.com Samuel Gawith's biggest selling flake, 1792 is produced from Dark-Fired leaf, stripped, pressed and subtly flavored with tonquin to produce a slow burning, spicy and full flavored smoke.

* Component Tobaccos: Dark Fired Kentucky, Virginia
 
* Cut: Gawith flake all the way. Thick meaty slabs of rich brown pressed tobacco goodness. Wet as only a Gawith flake can be. Breaks up easier than Full VA Flake, maybe a little thinner.
 
* Pouch Aroma: Tonquin Tonquin Tonquin. If you have never smelled it, it is a chameleon, hard to put your finger on. Vanilla-ish, cinnamon-ish, a little cherry. I swear I was in the mens room in a bar yesterday and the air freshner reminded me of Tonquin. The smell of the casing completely overwhelms the tobacco.

* Taste: Rich. I don’t have another word to describe it. The tonquin has a flavor that compliments the flavor of the dark fired in a very satisfying way. It adds a little sweetness that the dark fired lacks, and adds a different dimension of smokey. The taste evokes the spice mélange from Dune. Frank Herbert described the spice as having a “bitter cinnamon” taste. This isn’t the spice from cinnamon candies or the creamy sweetness of pumpkin pie, this the scent and taste that overwhelms you when encounter Shai Halud up close and personal (in my imagination at least). “Bless the Maker and His water. Bless His coming and His going May His passage cleanse the world”. Ok enough hyperbole. You can get a little of the Dark Fired flavor though the tonquin. I can’t perceive the VA directly at all. There is a distinct sweetness but I am not clear if that is the VA or something in the casing or both. Pairs great with black coffee or English breakfast tea with a little sugar and dash of milk. 

* Strength: Strong. If you have a glass jaw when it comes to facing lady nicotine in the ring, this isn’t your blend. Stronger than Irish flake. As strong as the Gawith and Hoggarth Ropes and Five Brothers. Slightly lower nicotine effect than G&D Dark Flake for me. If you are trying it for the first time make sure you use a small bowl and have some food in your stomach. A sweet drink wouldn’t hurt either. Smoke this right before bed and experience the vivid enhancement of dreams that nicotine can cause. I like it best in a medium sized bowl. 
 
* Smokability: Impossible to burn without copious drying. I cube cut it fairly fine then gravity fill. If well dry burn without issue, usually without dottle. My preferred method has been to microwave for 15 seconds followed by a 5 minute rest before loading while I make a cup of tea.  Rubbed out I find it a little finicky and it had a tendency to burn hot on me. With cube cut it burns at a reasonable pace without getting too warm. 

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. Seems pretty potent in the garage. Wife hates it.

* Thoughts: I love this stuff. The flavor is obnoxious but in a good way. After burning through a tin in short order, I pick up the scent of tonquin everywhere. Every unidentified floral & spice mixture gets registered in my brain as tonquin. Potpourri- tonquin, air freshener in mens room – tonquin, mother-in-law’s weird vanilla perfume – tonquin. I think I need a little break. In another 6-8 months I will get another tin. I don’t think I could handle a large box. I would either OD on nicotine or smoke it exclusively until I get so fatigued from it that the thought on tonquin would make me puke.

Dai7: Always wanted to try it. I'll have to get some in plug form (cob plug) I get get that cheaper and in a smaller amount.

antiwittgenstein: I have been intrigued by this blend but terrified of the strength. I just about lost my lunch in the yard after half a bowl of C&D Burley Flake #1. I doubt I could do more than a few puffs of this without popping an eye out.

professor_throway: The C&D burley flakes are pretty strong. I had a few bowls of #3 and it compares pretty favorably in terms of strength with 1792. If you like tonquin at all, or are curious about it I would say give it a go.
