My First Not Quite a Review: Some thoughts on Haunted Bookshop.

I have been wanting to try this for a while. /u/tochrais was kind enough to send me a bowlful. I am going to start waaaayyyy in left field, but hopefully make sense.

Spring of 1991 I was finishing up my freshman year of college. We all liked to go to the movies and this was the summer that quite possibly one of the most misrepresented movies was released, and it never recovered. I'm talking about *Hudson Hawk*. 

I say misrepresented. What I should have said was mistrailered. Bruce Willis was approaching the top of his game. Two *Die Hards* under his belt. I was always a fan of *Moonlighting*, though I didn't care for Cybil Shepherd.

That was the problem. The trailer I remember painted an all out action movie. The movie itself was a comedy with some decent action moments. The trailer screamed John McClane. The movie was all David Addison. I can go back and watch that movie for what it is, and get some laughs. It is not a great movie, but it is not as terrible as I thought walking out of the theater feeling like I had just had a bait and switch.

To me, a name like Haunted Bookshop evokes either a solid but mild English, or some sort of aromatic with overtones of brandy and chocolate. Something you could smoke all day while reading a good book. Even though you go into it knowing it's a burley, there's just something about the name that gives me, at least, those inferences.

So, I didn't smoke it right away. I would smell the tin note in the bag a couple of times a day and tried to forget the name. Tonight as I was running errands, I put some in my 'truck pipe' and had a go.

I am a vitamin N middleweight so far. I have not tried any knock you on your butt levels of stuff, but I enjoy Nightcap, Squadron Leader, Gaslight, etc. This blend fell right in there in regards to the nicotine levels.

I am just getting into burleys. As someone who grew up in a house where both my parents smoked 2 packs a day of Salem Light 100s, burleys are tough because they smell a lot like cigarettes. Haunted Bookshop is the most pleasant burley based I have tried. 

Retrohale gave me a wood/nutty flavor I can't quite pinpoint, but the closest I can come is the smell of pecan hulls and fresh cut hardwood boards like walnut or red oak (my dad also does some woodworking). Perhaps Haunted Woodshop would be a better name.

It stayed lit even when I went into a store for a brief errand (a must for any good driving around tobacco), and I enjoyed the flavor changes as I worked through the bowl. It had a really mild room note (or should I say cab note) and the usual comments from the missus about me smelling like I just walked out of a cigar store were absent when I got home.

I read a lot of reviews of people disappointed in HB, but I have to say I found it a solid end of the day smoke. I could see it going into the rotation for nights I want to sit on the deck and have some bourbon.

I don't know if this was much of a review. If you like burleys (or are just getting into them) I think this is worth a shot. I will more than likely be picking up a tin when the opportunity presents itself.

FullFrontalNoodly: I'm not sure I'm catching your references, but [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunted_Bookshop) is the origin of the name.

As to the association with flavors, I believe it has something to do with [this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2647333/Why-old-books-smell-good-Infographic-reveals-complex-chemistry-comforting-scent-yellowed-pages.html)

Highball2814: Thanks. I have not read that, but it looks interesting.
And I know I dated myself with those references, lol.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for posting a review! I know your dilemma, that expectation, that when not met, even if it was based on a flawed set of assumptions, leads to disappointment. However when I smoked HB it was in a series of burleys and I found it to be my favorite of the C&D offerings so far. I guess when I wrote that sentence I *meant* just the burleys, but upon retrospection, it is true in the larger sense. After you've had Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, and some - gasp - non C&D burley blends, go back around and try the Bookshop once more. Come back and tells then what you think of the stuff. 

Oh, and keep the reviews coming.

tochrais: I was happy to see you enjoyed it. I have purchased blends based on the name and was really disappointed and passed on blends based on name that are probably great.

givemeyours0ul: The solution is to buy them all and let God sort them out.
