Tobacco Review: McClelland No 5100 Red Cake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #4

**Blend Name:** McClelland No. 5100 Red Cake

**Description on Tin:** McClellandâ€™s #5100 Red Cake is a sweet, exceptionally soft, fully-rubbed matured cake; this is a fine, medium-bodied smoke. Simple, straight-forward, rich red Virginias comprise this blend which is extremely high-grade and refined.
 
**Leaf:** Very uniform brown (not red!) coarse cut leaf.

**Tin Aroma:** Newman's Own raisins. The red kind.

**Taste:** First light it comes straight tobacco - not forward, not too strong. It is reminscient of my youthful sternum spasming experimentation with unfiltered Camels. But this flavor quickly goes away. But nothing replaces it. For about 1/3-1/2 of the bowl I had a steady stream of puffs with no flavor. Zilch. It didn't even grow hot, but burned evenly. I made sure smooth was coming out of my mouth, but no, it was a ghost. Eventually, oh eventually, the tobacco flavor came back, but it was stronger here, richer. Still very, er, cigarettey, but palatable. It stuck to that one flavor to the end. 

**Smokability:** Needs more drying time than you think, and likes to be packed more densely than you think you really ought'n'to.

**Room Note:** Did someone smoke cigarettes in here?

**Thoughts:** After wrestling with Blackwoods, I wanted a McClelland that wasn't a flake, and found myself drawn increasingly to high red-va blends, so I tried this one out. It really shows what age does for tobacco - or rather, what unaged tobacco tastes like. Which is not particularly much. This is also 
one of the few pure, unblended tobaccos I have tried, which again underlines how just little burley, perique, cavendish, etc. can flesh out the smoking experience.

I am going to seal this up and review it again in a year, with a side by side with one of the McClleand Mature Virginia line, to really investigate how time can transform this leaf.

**Summary:** This would great to blend, age, or roll your own cigarettes with.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Wuthering Heights)

====================================
Darwin7848: Interesting.  The Venn diagrams of goodish and baddish intersect at the only American author.  That might mean something but I can't think what at the moment.

antiwittgenstein: Well I actually cannot name another American female novelist of the 19th I have read. I have had 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' on my to read list for decades, but I haven't scratched it off yet. Got some recommendations?
--
Darwin7848: After Stowe and Alcott female American novelists get kind of thin on the ground.  Frances Burnett wrote some adult novels but was mainly famous for kiddie fare such as Little Lord Fauntleroy and The Secret Garden.  There were one or two English transplant novelists but suffice to say that all of the American born female writers of adult novels in the 19th century would fit in a fairly small closet.  If you account for the hoop skirts the closet might need to be medium size.

antiwittgenstein: Hahahahaha! Thanks mate.

====================================
mparker762: Put it in a freezer bag and leave it in your garage over the summer.  The heat will age it quickly and it will be amazing.
--
antiwittgenstein: Interesting.

Do you have any insight to what the physics or chemistry of 'the aging process' is? Is it chemical breakdown, or some more complex fermentation process? If it is such a process, keeping it a highish heat, say 100-200 F, for a few hours or days, would that actually accelerate the process - or just toast the goodies?

xDemagog: Upvotes to /u/Darwin7848 and /u/antiwittgenstein for all the literature references.

====================================
jarvis400: Good review, thanks!

I agree with your assessment. I remember trying a few ounces of this years ago and I found it absolutely unremarkable VA tobacco. Well, one aspect that actually was remarkable, was the added humectant -- the tobacco wouldn't dry to decent moisture level no matter how long I left it to dry. It did imrove a little bit with some added perique and a few years of aging.

====================================
pixeechick: Am I missing something, or is the rating absent?
--
antiwittgenstein: I gave it a +/- but with caveat that I will revisit this after a year.
