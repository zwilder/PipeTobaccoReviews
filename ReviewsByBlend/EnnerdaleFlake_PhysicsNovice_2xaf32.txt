====================================
PipeBeard: Awesome. More for me and /u/Xdemagog ;)
--
PhysicsNovice: Well then, enjoy it until I can figure out a way to raze the fields of Lake District. 
--
PipeBeard: That would be a bit...excessive 
--
PhysicsNovice: [Seems reasonable to me.](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kill_it_with_fire.gif) I guess we're just on different wavelengths.

xDemagog: Coming from the guy who wants to put on sundresses. 

Yes, very different wave lengths.

====================================
PhysicsNovice: Tin description:

> Virginias, burley, and sun-cured tobaccos with flavors of almond, vanilla and various fruits. 

You know those smells in shops that sell potpourri, artisan paper, and the warm fuzzy Hallmark felling. Thats what this reminded me of. I had the sudden urge to put on a sun dress and visit a rose garden. 

For those that enjoy things that smell like nothing mother nature could ever produce then go for it.

drdvna: I am always reminded of white cake with buttercream frosting, Princess cake, marzipan, Earl Grey Tea, cool but sunny winter afternoons.

PhysicsNovice: Im reminded of scented soap... In my mouth...

====================================
tennesseean_87: I just had my first bowl last night. I definitely get the soap thing, but slightly foody (the almond vanilla cake thing). I didn't find it unpleasant. I'll smoke the rest of my sample to figure out if it's something I'll keep around for a change of pace or not. 
--
PhysicsNovice: It ghosted my mouth for several hours. Unlike any tobacco I've tried.
