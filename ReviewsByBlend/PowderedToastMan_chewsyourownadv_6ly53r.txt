Clenching Tenaciously near Both His Buttocks - A Review of Powdered Toast Man
By: chewsyourownadv

**Blend name**: POWDEEEEERRRRRED TOOOOOOOOAST MAAAAAAAAN

**Description on tin:** [Uhhhh....](http://imgur.com/a/dENjw)

**Leaf:** Ribbon cut, looks to be Virginias (at least one variety of red) and burley. It's noticeably topped and moist, but not goopy or sticky.

**Tin note:** I'll be damned. French Toast. The "powdered sugar" part comes across a little more like marshmallows, but I get the point.

**Taste:** I'll be damned. *Almost* French toast. Cinnamon, toasted marshmallow, and maple syrup on the charring light. The room note is about as nice, as I hear it. I had to try a couple of packing methods before I found one that resulted in consistently pleasant taste, but when I found it, I had the topping flavor last halfway through the bowl. The Virginia becomes noticeable, nice and breadlike, about 1/4 of the way through, and in the bottom quarter the normal Virginia and Burley flavors take over. The middle is the nicest part, some of the topping flavors remaining while I get a nice bit of normal tobacco flavors. The bottom of the bowl isn't anything special: the Virginias take a backseat to burley, and the burley is a little harsh. This resulted from a looser packing than I normally like, in a not very wide bowl. My first couple of attempts with a tighter pack and some drying, the second half of the bowl was terrible, all nasty alkaline bitey burley. Pack loose, and maybe shallowly, and it shouldn't need much drying. This makes it a little thin and whispy, but good all the way down to the bottom of the bowl.

**Smokeability:** This blend is finicky. My normal 3 stage packing with a bit of drying started great, all cinnamon and syrup and marshmallow, but mediocre approach halfway, and was awful past the first half. As suggested in Taste, I experimented and settled on a loose pack with no drying. I can easily get through a bowl with no bite this way, and very few relights. Smoke this one carefully, it bites like most other aromatics in my book.

**Does it grape?** Jesus no. No it does not. You might think that it results in something like "french toast with a sweet fruit topping" but it doesn't and it's terrible. Do it.

**Rating:** 6/10. I could probably bump up the rating to a 7 or 8 if I could pack normally without the end of the bowl going nasty on me.

Thanks to /u/coldsolderjoint /and u/linearone. I've enjoyed the sample you sent.

Just a suggestion: If you're looking for a more natural buttery taste as described in your note, consider the slightest addition of Drama, Yenidje, or Katerini. If you haven't, try some Drama Reserve, Yenidge Supreme, or Katerini Classic to get a showcase of any one of them. They're very floral, but scale back the ratio and it's almost like an olive oil taste. I've seen it described as buttery.
====================================
linearone: Thank you for the honest review. Ive been smoking it myself cause i just love it. Im happy with it because it is slightly more complex than just a cased cavendish. Ive definitely had wet dottle at the bottom but i can smoke it with one light, but then again everyones cadence is different and i probably puff more frequently. I never get the harsh bitter bottom you experienced but hey, all palates are different. Im glad you enjoyed it!!

chewsyourownadv: It's a step up from most aromatics I've had. Usually even a dry, loose pack doesn't prevent the awful burley bite that comes with aromatics for me. I'm digging it; it just took me some effort to find the right method. That's a good deal better than I can say for most aromatics that come across my pipes.
--
linearone: Absolutely and that was part of the goal an aro with real tobacco goodness.  Out of curiosity , what pipe did you use and did you use a filter? Follow up question,  do you think the experience would benefit from a filter?
--
chewsyourownadv: I used a few different pipes, finding it worked best in a Sav Rossi Rubino. It's built for a 9mm filter but I generally dislike filters. In that pipe, I just leave the filter out and usually pack tighter to compensate for the more open draw. Would it benefit from a filter? Maybe. I dunno, it's been a long time since I bothered with one.

====================================
pipegrouch: Haha does it grape? "It's terrible. Do it."
--
linearone: I told everyone it wouldnt..lol
--
====================================
coldsolderjoint: My personal preference is to dry the crap out of it. 
--
chewsyourownadv: I tried that at first and found it just lost too much of the french toast flavor.
--
====================================
Doctormaxi: Does it Semois?
--
chewsyourownadv: My experience is that it's better to modify Semois than it is to modify something else with Semois. You want a fantastic combination? Try 75% Semois and 25% Drama Reserve.
