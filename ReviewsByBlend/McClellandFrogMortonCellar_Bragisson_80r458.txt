Review: Frog Morton Cellar
By: Bragisson
---
I was extremely excited to finally try one of the famous blends out of Frog Morton. Happily, I found it at a local B&M for a decent price. 
Upon opening the tin, there was something odd about the tobacco. It was hard, and cube cut. Nowhere on the tin did it say anything about cube cut. Alrighty then, it’s a mystery folks. 
So, in picking up this oddly tough, rough, and charred tobacco, I tried to break a piece off. Man oh man, this stuff was tough. After countless minutes of attempting to roll it out, I took a knife with a serrated edge. I’m telling you, devoted reader, I think it dulled my knife, that’s how hard this stuff was! 
I had to think here, hard and long. Perhaps it’s like a plug, and didn’t need to be broken down. So I attempted to shove the cube into my largest pipe. Miraculously it fit, so time to get a smoking!
The topping is definitely wood, and it lasts throughout the whole bowl. It was extremely hard to keep lit, but I finally got a nice smoldering going. Halfway through the bowl, I noticed the tobacco had completely combusted into an open flame, charring the bowl of my pipe. In an attempt to ash the pipe, and put the fire out, the flame strengthened, and engulfed my favorite Nørding. In a panic, I threw it out of my car window on the highway, where the flaming pipe was run over by a semi who was not expecting such turn of events. 

All in all, I’d give my experience an 8/10. The strength was mild, the taste was very woody, and it burned hot hot. Lost two points for destroying my pipe, and scarring the poor trucker who almost flew off the road.

Tis-a-FleshWound: Nice job going "against the grain" with your review! So,what's you final opinion, "wood" you smoke it again even with the bad experience? Gonna go "out on a limb" and say the problem might have been user error.

misterzipp0: I saw this pun coming a mile away

SupraMario: He really nailed it though.

Tis-a-FleshWound: I tried to “stave” off the puns, but I couldn’t keep them “tamped” down...

JorumOfSkeeee: LOL...now I'm not sure if this was better as a sight gag or this write-up. I kinda imagine it as one of those old-school emails where you have to do a lot of reading before you scroll to the bottom and see the picture that explains why your mind has started feeling twitchy. Anyway, I dare you to post this up on tobaccoreviews.com

Bragisson: I’ll take that dare!

Alligator_Gar: I use a bandsaw to prep mine. Let me know if you want to trade the packing material surrounding your cube of goodness for more cubes of goodness.

JorumOfSkeeee: Love it! Excellent shenanigans. It's good that not everything has to be so serious all the damn time.

RoundedColt8: "Cube cut" and the fact that FMC has that cube of whiskey barrel gave it away, and as soon as I realized it only got funnier lol
