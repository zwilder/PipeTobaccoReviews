Review: Brunello Flake

**Blend Name**: Savinelli's Brunello Flake

**Desciption on Tin**: An impeccably structured blend featuring a foundation of sweet, tangy Virginias and cool burning Burleys, a dash of Macedonian leaf is added to round out the mixture and add a hint of the exotic. The different leafs are then aged as one, in order to marry and harmonize flavor, prior to being pressed into a tantalizing flake.

**Leaf**: Virginia, Burley and Macedonian leaf. Full Flake.

**Tin Aroma**: Fruity, sugary sweetness. Its what I would imagine an old timey Starburst candy would smell like. 

**Age**: Back of the tin says it was sealed in June 2014

**Pipe(s) Used**: Savinelli Hercules 604 EX (OOM Paul) and Peterson's Kinsale XL23 w/P-lip

**Taste**: Delicious! Sweet Virginias mixing with the Macedonia leaf is a wonderful, savory experience. The flavor remains full and consistent throughout the whole bowl. As a lover of Virginia I am not dissapointed. Occasionally my nostrils will experience a pleasant tingle on the exhale. 

**Smokability**: I found my usual flake packing method to work just fine with this blend. I will tear about a 1/3 of a flake off and fold it twice and stuff it into the bottom of the bowl. Than I'll rub out enough to gravity fill it to the top of the bowl. Char, tamp, relight.

**Room Note**: Virginia, that wonderful scent that all humans should smell and savor.

**Thoughts**: I really like this blend, as both a lover of Virginia and flakes. This also redeemed Burley for me. As my previous experience was with Captain Black (which I didn't hate, but just found it lacking and uninteresting) and the *shudders* Borkim Riff. So Burleys are okay in my book and I look forawrd to trying more of them. I've also never had Macedonian leaf before so theres another one of my horizons opened up. 

Reccomended to: Anyone who enjoys Virginias and wants to really experience the sweetness they bring. And to anyone who wants to smoke something that is generally sweeter tasting, this blend should not dissapoint.

Summary: Sweet, delicious flake which I could see myself smoking regularly. And I'll also have to cellar some ;)

4/5 Stars

Happycheeze: This was my first blend with Macedonian and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm trying to give this blend more visibility. There was only 2 reviews for it on tobaccoreviews.com. I added mine to it. Hope more people can enjoy this.
