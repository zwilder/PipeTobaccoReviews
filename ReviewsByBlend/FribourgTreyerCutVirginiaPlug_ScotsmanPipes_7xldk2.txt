Fribourg & treyer - cut virginia plug (CVP) review
By: ScotsmanPipes
---
Shaking the tin makes a slight rattle sound and upon opening I am greeted by about 20 flakes neatly stacked in a paper square, like a Chinese takeout box.  The tin note is ketchup and wet hay.  The ketchup smell is not as heavy as a McClelland tin.

These flakes are fragile, so fragile I am surprised they made it to me almost entirely intact.  A bit moist, but very easily rubbed out into a fine ribbon.

I packed the bowl loosely and lit it up to be hit by some sweet, sweet, sweet smoke.  As the bowl progressed I got tastes of chocolate more and more, but not like a Hershey bar.  This flake smokes like a smooth, rich, Belgian truffle.  I could see myself saving this for special occasions.

Solid 10/10 if you like sweet smokes and Virginias. 
====================================
HandsomeRalphy: Good review. Was debating throwing a tin on my next order, guess this seals it.

misterzipp0: Thanks for the review! I recently picked up some F&T Special Brown Flake and it too is *very* sweet for a Va, I got a lot of sweet cream from mine.
--
ScotsmanPipes: I was close to getting the brown flake.  I really can't wait until this gets a few years on it.

====================================
pipeandpendulum: Nice one - its a great virginia to be sure. I just bought about 10 tins of this stuff since it comes out so rarely. Good review.  Hear told this tobacco is EXCELLENT with age also
--
ScotsmanPipes: I'm looking forward to opening it up again after a few years given how well it smokes fresh.  I got 5 tins and I'll probably slowly finish the one I just opened over the year and save the rest for as long as I can.

kingjames488: sounds good, I never really payed much attention to F&T but maybe I'll take another look!

====================================
xtermin8r69: Yeah it’s a great flake and at times a little scarce 
--
====================================
Chemical_Lab: First I’ve ever heard of this tobacco.  Who is currently selling it?
--
ScotsmanPipes: I got it from smokingpipes.com but it looks like it's out of stock now.  It seems to be a bit scarce, but not like an esoterica.  From review dates it seems to come around at least once or twice a year.
--
Chemical_Lab: Thanks- I’ll keep an eye out.  Your nice review has tickled my interest.  Well done!
