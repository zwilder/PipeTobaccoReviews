By: jelbert6969
---
Brand: Autumn Evening

Blend Type: Aromatic

Contents: Cavendish, Virginia

Cut: Coarse Cut

Flavoring: Fruit / Citrus, Maple, Rum, Sweet / Sugar, Vanilla, Whiskey

Price: Around 9 bucks in North Carolina for 2oz.

Package: Tins or Bulk.

Initial smell: Raisins, maybe some fruit and Whiskey. Hard to narrow it down but smelled very good. Wife thought it smelled like nutmeg, daughter thought Oatmeal Raisin cookies

Feel: Not to dry and not to moist. I smoked without setting it out.

Light: Just 2 lights to smoke entire bowl, so it was pretty nice, not much of a fuss.

Thoughts on first half: Really good, the flavor was good from first light all the way to the bottom, It never really changed for me.

While smoking: It had a lot of flavors happening, all of them pleasant. It was hard for me to nail down to just one, I would recommend some water while you smoke this since the flavors seems to get jumbled and water cleaned it away and brought everything fresh again. Raisins seem to come through the most for me.

Time: It lasted a good long time in my pipe. And burned down to just grey ash.

Heat: Pipe never got more than a slight warm.

Pipe after smoke: No goopy mess just a quick wipe with a paper towel and it was good to go.

Vitamin N: Had more than most aromatics. I felt a tad hungry before I smoked and the Nicotine kind of pushed that back.

Room note: Was outside but my wife came out with me which she seldom does and when she went in she left the screen door open, which is a huge deal if you knew her. My beard smells really good. Daughter commented that is smelled good.

Me: 100 percent aromatic smoker.

Thoughts: If you are looking for a nice autumn smoke this is the one.

archimedesrex: It's funny, I've heard a lot of people complain about the blend being too sweet and flavored. When I smoked it (from bulk) I thought the maple stood out, but the toppings weren't as prominent as the tin note made me think they would be. I was actually hoping for something a little more boldness and warmness from it. I think it could have benefited from cutting down on the Virginia and putting a sizable amount of burley in it.

That said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.

Chrisj2001: But the Virginia makes it so zesty!  I *almost* wanna toss in pinch of Big N' Burley to take your dare.

Chrisj2001: I've probably said it 100 times and people are getting tired of it, but Autumn Evening is the only blend I keep in steady rotation aromatic-wise. In my head, that's a high accolade since I mostly smoke Old Joe Krantz, Haunted Bookshop, Crooner, and other assorted grisly burley and English blends.  It doesn't get that funky, crunchy, half burnt dottle all up in your business.  It slaps Molto Dolce in full Nelson and pink-bellies the shit out of it into submission.
