[Review] McClelland Private Reserve "Bombay Court"

For my second review, I've picked a blend that I think is seriously underrated. I hear barely a mention of this one, but it has easily won a spot in my regular rotation. Without further ado...

**Cut:** I'd call this a "coarse" cut. There some ribbon-y bits of what look like Virginias to me, but there are also some shorter chunks and bits flake mixed in. Pretty much the same cut you find in many of the McClelland blends, like Frog Morton.

**Format:** 50g pop-top can, moved to glass jar shortly after opening.

**Purchase Data/Price**: 10/2/17, $9.50, from smokingpipes.com.

**Smoked in:** For the purposes of this review, my Savinelli Roma 305.

**Moisture level:** This one was what felt just about perfect to me straight out of the can.

**Nicotine level:** Significant. While in general I'd say the nicotine is just a bit noticeable on this one, I did have one incident where I had a significant bout of nicotine sickness after smoking a bowl of this one. I don't know if it was just that I hadn't eaten, or that it was my second bowl of the day and maybe I had some nicotine already built up in my system, but felt worth noting - smoker beware.

**Tin note:** The dominant note out of the tin is that signature McClelland vinegar/barbecue sauce note. I understand some folks aren't a fan of that aroma, but I find it quite appetizing. Makes me want to go get some ribs and brisket from my local barbecue joint. There's some underlying earth, campfire, and leather notes too, typical of a Latakia blend.

**Smoking mechanics:** The coarse cut is a bit "springy", so getting in packed in the bowl can require a few extra tamps. While it takes a light fairly easily, I did find myself needing to re-light quite a few times when I was smoking for the purposes of this review. I don't recall that being as much of an issue from previous bowls, but perhaps I just didn't notice. One thing I will say is that my experience with virtually every McClelland tobacco I've tried is that they are virtually impossible to get overly hot. The smoke always stays nice and pleasantly cool regardless of conditions or cadence, and I'd say Bombay Court is no exception to that.

**Tasting note:** Quite smooth in texture, but fairly rich, full bodied,  and full-flavored. Latakia is front-and-center here -- notes of baking chocolate, earth, and a bit of smokey campfire dominate. What I find really interesting about this blend though, is the flavors from the Orientals. They provide a noticeable condiment note to the Latakia here, leaning more toward the incense (sandalwood) than floral end of the spectrum. It may be power of suggestion from the name, but the thing I love about this blend is that I get a distinctly exotic spice note. You could say cinnamon, clove, or even turmeric, but I'd call it garam masala. It's really what give this blend it's uniqueness and charm in my book. I also regularly smoke, and am a fan of, Frog Morton, and this blend reminds me of a slightly more exotic, Oriental-forward version of that blend. I've never tried FM on The Bayou, but I wonder if folks who are familiar with that blend might find some similarity here. The finish on this one has some weight to it, and is very chocolatey and creamy, which lends itself very well to pairing with a warm cup of coffee or a nice, cold porter or stout.

**Overall**: Very good! I'm surprised I don't hear more about this blend as I think the quality is high and there's a lot of interesting, distinct flavor on offer here. I think anyone who's a fan of the Frog Morton line would find this to be a pleasant smoke. I also think it's an interesting take on an Oriental-forward blend, being much darker and fuller in body than most of the "Balkan" blends and Sobranie clones I've tried. Many of the Euro Balkan blends have a sort of soft, elegant, and refined character to them, while this is a little more robust and rustic -- but in a good way.

**A bit of background on me:** I've only been smoking a pipe for a few months now, so you may want to take that into account reading a review from me, but have become, perhaps, a tad obsessed with the hobby. I've already acquired and tried dozens of tobaccos and more than a handful of pipes, and I read/watch everything I can find about smoking pipes. I'm new to reviewing tobaccos but I did spend several years in the wine industry where I got accustomed to tasting from a critical perspective an writing tasting notes.

Oh, and thanks u/antiwittgenstein for inspiring the recent cavalcade of reviews on this sub, it's been fun reading them all!
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Thanks for reviewing this one. It is the only of the Private Reserve I've not yet bought. I think I will have to rectify that soon.
