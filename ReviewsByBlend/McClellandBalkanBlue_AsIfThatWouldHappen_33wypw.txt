====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: **Note:** I decided to do a full review after posting a smaller version on the Community Review post. I have finished my tin now, and tried it in Briar, Cob, and Meerschaum. It is a shame it got so little feedback in the community review. We all know this was not intentional.I thought the community here might like another in depth review. It is a little long winded, but I hope it is informative.

**Review #10**

**Name** McClelland Blue Mountain / Balkan Blue

**Description On Tin** Rich with the finest Mountain Latakia, a classic full Balkan pipe tobacco mixture, smooth and deeply fragrant. The inspiration for this elegant mixture was a 21-year-old tin of the legendary #759.

**Leaf** A medium ribbon cut, very dark with a small smattering of lighter browns here and there. Good moisture out of the tin.

**Tin Aroma** The tin note is beautiful on this blend, it is rich, smokey, sweet, the spiciness and sharpness of the orientals is very noticeable too. There is a slight McC vinegar note hanging
around but it doesn't interfere with the aroma. It gave the impression for me that there was a good dose of latakia waiting to greet me when I lit it up. A very appetising offering.

**Taste** With the first light the Latakia smokiness is there, it is only a little camp-firey though and a little sweeter than I find most lat flavour. The Vinegar from the aroma is there as well, but it
seemed to fade out as the smoke went on. The Latakia moved to the rear and the orientals came forward with the Va's in tow, the sweetness developed and the orientals carried a lovely spiciness. It is a very fresh, and 'quality' tasting tobacco. and was very well balanced between the elements.  The smoke is exceedingly smooth, retrohale has no chance of burning the nose, the tongue is safe from bite too. I French inhaled regularly and re-inhaled the smoke up my nose before retrohaling, it was super smooth and flavourful. At this point, about halfway, I was still very impressed with this blend. After this, I am not sure why, but I kind of started to lose interest in it, it felt a little one dimensional, personally I found it just wasn't complex enough, or bold enough, almost as if this blend could kick it up a few more notches in the flavour department but felt like playing it safe instead. Towards the end of the bowl I seemed to regularly find a developing sourness, not the kind I sometimes look for,but a slightly soapy or almost chemical/preservative taste I could never quite put my finger on.
It was never enough to turn me off, or ruin the bowl, but it just didn't make me light up inside like a really fantastic blend does when it just gets it right.The time I spent pondering over this taste detracted from my enjoyment when it finally hit. I honestly don't know whether it is just me, just my tin, or just the way they intended it to be and it's just not for me.

This is where it became hard to judge and review, it is in NO WAY AT ALL a bad blend, on the contrary I enjoyed every bowl and finished my tin very quickly, and I would buy another one if I came across it. I just didn't find that it rocked my world like I expected it to. I did find it tasted a bit better after some time in the Mason Jar, so next time around I will jar up a whole tin and leave it for a few months before I crack into it.

**Smokeability** No complaints here, packs, lights, and burns like a dream. Great moisture from the tin, it always burnt down to white ash for me and stayed cool and dry.

**Summary** This is not easy for me. This was a **GOOD** smoke, but I didn't find it **Great**, which I think
is what I was expecting. As I said in my earlier quick review, it doesn't do anything wrong, it just doesn't get something right, and I can't pinpoint what it is. It is no fuss to pack and smoke, the nic was gentle for me, it was simple enough to be an all day smoke. It is well balanced and smooth, but in my opinion it could be bolder and richer, and more complex. I still feel it was playing it safe. It just felt flat. I will definitely get another tin, and
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, but it won't be knocking anything out of my current rotation. It is definitely worth a try,and I am sure others find it more amazing than I did, it may just be that rare blend that doesn't agree with me.

With such a wonderful Aroma, it just didn't deliver the flavour I thought it was promising, it was like smelling a wonderful stout, pouring a glass and taking a sip, and tasting light beer.


**SCORE: 3.75 / 5**

**My Background:** I have only been smoking pipes for around 8 months.In that time I have worked my way through a number of blends, finding English/Balkan/Oriental blends to be my thing. I am currently working on expanding my palate for different styles, 
and improving my knowledge and understanding of the pipe and tobacco art.

====================================
None: Very good review, it is definitely topped and surprisingly most people I talk to don't realize it/believe it, not bad but not a favorite for me, I prefer a more natural flavor.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thankyou.
I prefer Legends\Wilderness over this, they taste more natural, and 'bigger' too.
--
None: Legends IS a great one.
--
paok1234: Just out of curiosity BriarBoy because I haven't picked it from your videos. What is your go to smoke? The one you just sit to relax with.
--
None: To be honest I can't really say I have a "go to smoke" I rarely smoke the same blend repeatedly, I like variety, a few I really enjoy are G.L. Pease Westminster, Cornell & Diehl Pirate Kake, Hearth & Home Larry's Blend, I could go on & on, I've only been at it about 5 years but have tried 100's of blends, I enjoy predominately English/Balkan style blends but have been enjoying more Virginia/Perique blends in the last year as well.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: I'll have to try a few of those, I don't have a go to either, variety is the spice of life.
I'm smoking a great blend right now, will definitely be doing a review soon :)
