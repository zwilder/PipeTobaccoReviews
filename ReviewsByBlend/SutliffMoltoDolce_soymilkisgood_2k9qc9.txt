[Review:] Sutliff Molto Dolce
By: soymilkisgood
---
**Blend Name:** Sutliff Private Stock Molto Dolce

**Description on Tin:** Rich and Creamy Texture of Vanilla, Caramel and Honey

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish, Burley, Virginia

**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla, Honey, Caramel apples, melon, chocolate?

**Taste:** Vague background of tobacco. Some sweetness, but really shines on the retrohale. The flavors from the tin note come out when the smoke is tasted by the nose rather than the mouth. No spice on the retrohale so in my opinion it should routinely be passed through the nose. It’s really the sugary dessert birthday cake of tobaccos.

**Strength and Nicotine:** Negligible in both departments. Like an ultra featherweight if there were such a category in the pipe tobacco world. 

**Smokeability:** Very smokeable. A little moist straight out of the tin, I probably should have let this dry a bit more before stuffing a bowl. But still it lit and smoked just fine in my Savinelli with a balsa filter in it (I kept it in to mitigate some of the moistness of the tobacco). I’m not normally an aromatic smoker and I usually don’t smoke more than a bowl or two every few days, but if I were forced to smoke only this for a day or two I think it would be tolerable.

**Room Note:** Possibly the best part of this blend is the room note. My girlfriend noted that it smelled good in the room, which is a compliment I seldom get when I smoke anything (like I said, no aros for me usually). So it gets a thumbs up in this department. The vanilla, honey, and caramel come out most in the room note.

**Thoughts:** It’s a classic aromatic, through and through. Nothing more and nothing less. Very solid if you like aromatics, and definitely something you could smoke all day. More akin to a candy and a dessert than a more natural tasting tobacco. But that’s some people’s bag, so it would be good for them. It’s not really my thing, so I really wouldn’t smoke it that often myself. But I may keep some around for when there’s “sensitive” company around.

**Recommend to:** Anyone that at least occasionally smokes aromatics. Solid offering that will please the people you’re with, and yourself if  you enjoy sweet retrohales and less tobacco flavor.

**Summary:** Is it my favorite all time blend? No. But it is good for what it’s supposed to be – an aromatic that is easily smoked and nice to be around. 

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for nearly three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). Not usually an aromatic smoker at all. 


Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a week or so ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and today I received six tins of Sutliff Private Stock in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is the first of many that I'll be doing as part of the program!

scriptonic: Lol

Flatticus: Molto Dolce is not a an aromatic.  It is the devil's Glade Plug-In.  But free's free.  Nice review man.

====================================
pluesha: Great review.

I had to dry this stuff out for 2 straights days, it just seems to come so oily, not even wet. I will try smoking it straight from the tin next time.

soymilkisgood: Probably better to let it dry out. I had a little trouble with gurgling because of the moistness, but I figured it wouldn't be fair to include because I didn't try to dry it out a bit. 
--
bovinitysupreme: That was my experience too, it was almost dripping with oil.

Otherwise, OP's review is pretty much what I would say about it too, though I'd add that it had a very interesting crackle to it when lighting and smoking.
