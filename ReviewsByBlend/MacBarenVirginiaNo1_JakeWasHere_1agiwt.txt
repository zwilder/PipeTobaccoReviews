Submitting a first tobacco review: Mac Baren Virginia No.1. Let me know if I can improve!
By: JakeWasHere

Tin aroma: My first impression was "whiskey"; on further consideration, I detected a great deal of fruitiness. There's no actual whiskey here, but it has that same appealing tang as the smell of a good Scotch, minus the alcohol -- part fruity, part turf.

Looks: A nice, mottled golden brown.

Preparation: Comes ready rubbed. I really didn't have to do much manipulation to get it into a loosely packed ball of ribbons that would fit comfortably in the pipe.

Taste: Not overpoweringly sweet. More grassy and herbal (for some reason I'm thinking of thyme), with a pleasant touch of spice. It's a very raw and natural Virginia taste, which is what I like about it; I imagine it'd sweeten up nicely if you cellared it for a while, but I didn't have the patience for that. It settled into a nice mellow note, like hay, as I proceeded through the bowl.

Aftertaste: Again, pleasantly spicy and mellow. Could almost call it woody. This is where that whiskey-ish tang from the tin shows up, but it's way more subtle than I expected -- more like an undernote.

Room note: Reminded me of well-browned toast, dark but not burnt. My nose is a little plugged, so I may be missing some of the subtleties.

Additional: I found it a bit of a challenge to keep lit all the way to the bottom, and I get the impression I very narrowly avoided getting tongue bite (this stuff would probably taste like a brushfire if you mistreated it) -- but those may just be artifacts of my own not-yet-refined smoking technique. Nicotine lift is very smooth, not intense enough to be called a buzz. Burns fairly hot if you're not careful, so I recommend setting it aside for a moment when you can devote full attention to it.

Rating: 3.75 / 5. Doesn't inspire raving enthusiasm (though for me, what *does?*), but a highly enjoyable and recommendable experience all the same.

My own personal preferences: This blend pushed one of the right buttons for me, as I'm definitely biased in favor of Virginias, Black Cavendishes, and Periques (but not *too* much Perique). I've had some excellent experiences in the past with flakes from Rattray, McClelland's 221b series, and some G.L. Pease Originals and Fog City blends -- but even Greg Pease couldn't win me over to Latakia. I've been smoking pipes, on and off, for almost ten years, but I have never really had the time or the cash needed to dive into the hobby as deeply as I'd like to.

jarvis400: Very nice review, thanks!

Your thoughts on Va #1 are very similar to my memories of this blend. It's "memories" because I haven't smoked it in many years. While I just love the mild toasty sweet taste, my mouth just can't handle it. It's one of those Mac Barens that scorch my toungue and mouth no matter how slow I smoke. I always have reasoned this is because of added sugars in the blend. 

FFIW, none of their newer (and more natural, I believe) HH blends I've tried, will not bite me.

I used to add about 5% blending perique and leave it melding for few months - it helped for the bite and made the taste more interesting IMO.

JakeWasHere: Mm. I found it more spicy than scorching, but there may be a few factors involved. 1) Painful experience has taught me to handle Virginias with care if I want to get the taste without the bite; the rewards of caution speak for themselves. 2) I have a wide pipe collection, mostly good-quality basket pipes, but the crowning jewel is my Peterson System bent apple -- I've designated that my all-Virginia pipe. The smoke doesn't go straight to my tongue, so the bite factor is significantly lessened.

jarvis400: Consider yourself lucky. I have a wimpy tongue and my body chemistry just doesn't go along with more sugary blends. Bright VAs (especially those with added sweetners) is one typical class I have most trouble with. 

I daresay, that after twelve years of smoking I'm slowly getting my technique down. Briar, meer, clay, gourd calabashes have been tried with no real help. Luckily there are abundance of blends out there that my palate approves.

Jaxx2112: We all have our kryptonite.  Lat bombs are mine.

jarvis400: Yeah, I find them often too acrid and dry to my tongue. A little lat goes a long way for me. Also, I prefer ones with Syrian weed.

Some people report that they get bitten by burleys. I don't have that chemical problem, but don't just care for the taste.
