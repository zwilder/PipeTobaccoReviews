Review: McClelland's Dominican Glory Maduro.

I HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED AND THUS I ANSWER!!!

Blend Name: Dominican Glory Maduro 

Description on Tin: Rich, dark maduro cigar leaf blended with matured re and stoved Virginia tobaccos. Pressed in cakes and aged to develop character and marry the flavors, then cut into flakes to be rubbed out to the smokers preference

Leaf: Dark brown throughout with flecks of yellow gold and swaths of black. Tobacco is a moist chunky crumble cake form that as the tin says benefits being rubbed out and just a few minutes to dry.

Tin Aroma: McClelland's trademark ketchup BBQ

PLEASE NOTE I HAVE ABSOLUTELY ZERO CIGAR SMOKING EXPERIENCE! THEREFORE I MAY OVERLOOK OR NOT FULLY APPRECIATE SOME KEY ASPECTS OF THIS BLEND THAT A CIGAR SMOKER WOULD LOVE. 

~~That being said if a couple of the herfers on here would like a sample to try this blend for themselves, so that they could either refute or lend some credence to my opinions on it, I would be happy to send them some~~ Edit: All of my remaining DGM has been claimed. Now on to the review...

Taste: On lighting this blend produces a smooth, sweet billowing gray smoke with a nice creamy texture and will give you a pleasant tingle in your nose from time to time. 

In the first half of the bowl I occasionally got hits of whatever provides the ketchup/BBQ smell but it had been changed into a more rich molasses flavor that served to perk up the smoke from it's otherwise uniform taste. Sadly this aspect faded throughout the second half of the bowl leaving only the sweet creamy taste that got to be rather boring towards the end. This alludes to the other big issue with this blend, the flavor while good is rather anemic overall and while it tastes good, it's so light that once the occasional pick up from the tin note has faded it just stays the same, a good but underwhelming flavor for the rest of the smoke. 

Smokability: Rubbed out a bit and still slightly moist from the tin it took the flame rather well (I suspect drying it a bit will make it take even better) and once I was able to focus on the pipe and pacing it kept the ember really well. Another point in its favor, this blend absolutely refused to bite even during periods of rapid, heavy puffing.

Room Note: The note was present and noticeable but neither pleasant or offensive. It took me a bit to figure out but it struck me as reminiscent of the candy coating they put on some of the candied popcorn you some times find at state fairs or 4th of July events. I don't mean like kettle or caramel corn either but the stuff that they put on to make the red and blue sections of the red, white and blue pop corn bags. All in all I don't see it being overly burdensome to those around you, especially if they are used to pipe smoke in general or are just passing by without lingering over long.

Thoughts: This is an inoffensive sweet blend that, while tasty and consistent through the smoke, seems to lack the flavorful punch I tend to look for on the fleeting times I have a chance to sit and smoke, especially during the cold days of winter. That being said with some practice and familiarity to the leaf this could easily become an all day smoke that won't weary the palate. It would in this case however need to be front and back ended by something with a bit more punch in the morning, to get wake you up as it were, and in the evening to refresh and invigorate your senses.

Recommend to: One of the poor souls who started piping with aromatics and want to branch out to more respectable forms of tobacco while not completely losing the sweetness of their hot air candy, or new pipers who want a tasty blend that won't drive off their friends and family nor punish them for their imperfect techniques. Sadly those are about the only people I can think to recommend this to.

Summary: In the end I have to say while this is a good blend it's good in the stolid, consistent and completely predictable kind of way. The die hard Virginians among us who are looking for something other than Bur or Per to provide a change of pace, may like this as a jumping off point for cigar blends but could likely do better with one of the other blends like Key Largo or Billy Bud, neither of which I have had though I am looking at acquiring some shortly. Whereas the many devotees of Our Lady of Latakia are likely to find this blend too mild and lacking in the intensity of flavor they are used to the Smokey Lady bestowing upon them. 

My Background: I've been piping for about 2 years (messed about with it prior but was so infrequent in smoking and halfhearted about it I can't really count that time period). I smoke only once or twice a week due to my living arrangements and other demands on my time that preclude me from sitting and truly enjoying my pipes but for all that I do truly consider myself a full on pipe smoker now.
====================================
soymilkisgood: What I get from your review is that this is a vaguely aromatic blend...really? Wow, I wouldn't have thought. I like a good cigar but would never have guessed a cigar leaf blend could come off as sweet and hot air-like.

carnesy: It's more savory sweet as opposed to saccharin sweet. Also it's not a hot air blend by any stretch, it's just the flavor is more delicate as opposed to the punch you in your face intensity that I get from the lat heavy blends I usually smoke, and not quite as eye (and sinus) opening as some of the blends with Perique that I've sampled lately. 

It is a good blend... the biggest sin to me is that it's boring. After the 1st half of the bowl it lacks any overtones or undertones that I can detect. Though to be honest my pipe palate is severely underdeveloped compared to some and as I've never smoked a cigar (though I do want to get into them) I am likely missing things others might catch. Hence the offer to send some samples to others who have some cigar background to see what they think.

Part of why I so readily accepted Hedonaut's challenge was in the hopes that by doing these reviews and taking time to consider the aspects of the blends I'll be reviewing, I can develop my palate and be able to pick up on and taste aspects of the leaf that I'd otherwise completely miss.

soymilkisgood: Interesting. I'll try some if you want to send it over. ;)

carnesy: If you PM me your address I'll try and get a bowl or three out to ya. It might be a bit though since between work and school I probably won't be able to make it over to the post office till next week sometime.

hedonaut: Interesting... I would have never expected this. The McCatsup was a given, but it's amazing to me that McC managed to make this blend light at all. I'd be curious to sample as well, and trade in turn with something that has more bite to it, but I'm glad I didn't go in for a tin on my order I'm building. It seem like McC like to err on the lighter side. I've never had anything from them I'd describe as really heavy. 

In any case, good review. Challenge well met.

carnesy: PM me your address. Soy has laid claim to some and I plan on sending most of the rest to my trade partner so if you want some let me know by Thursday night since I plan to mail off Soy's sample and my trade package on Friday.
