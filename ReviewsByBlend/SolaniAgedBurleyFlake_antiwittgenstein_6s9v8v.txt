Tobacco Review: Solani Aged Burley Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 88

**Blend Name:** Solani Aged Burley Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** A bold blend of dark fired burleys from Solani, the classic earthy heaviness of the dark fired burley really shines through in Aged Burley Flake, as does the nicotine that accompanies those heavy, robust flavors.

**Leaf:** Neat dark brown flakes, somewhat damp from the tin.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Musty, raisins, crayons, well used eraser

**Taste:** The essence of burley. Hay, gently nutty, brown bread, no, German black bread. A slight fruity edge to it. It took about six or so bowls to figure out it was raspberry. Lends just a touch of sweetness. Not sweet enough to make it actually sweet, but enough to round out the taste. Cigar elegance. I don’t know what this taste exactly is, but it is common to high quality burley blends and great cigars. It might be called leather in the cigar world, and it has maybe a whiff of that, chomping down on a leather belt, but it is elusive. It tas.tes rich, a bit oily, and full; the flavor, nameless as it is, coats the mouth. It doesn’t develop. Once you figure out the flavors they are consistent. Actually they recede under themselves, being very subtle, once your mouth has become coated in smoke, it is difficult to parse out the individual tastes again, but if you wait long enough, and pay attention, they come back around.

**Nicotine:** 5-6. I keep it to small bowls and usually stop before I hit dottle and before I feel the green come on.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Fair. My technique for best smokability with maximum laziness is to set out a flake to dry for 30 minutes to a few hours. This I mix with the remains of the previous flake, which has been sitting out for days. 
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but my beard smells like cigar.

**Thoughts:** Easily the best pure burley experience I have had yet, though that is limited to Sutliff Golden Dream, Brown Bogie, and Prince Albert. Golden Dream had little flavor to speak of. Brown Bogie tastes very much like the SABF, but maximizes the smoking difficulty and nicotine sectors. Prince Albert doesn’t have nearly this much flavor, but also has about zero kick.

However I think this flake shows the maximum Burley can do on its own. It is good, really quite good, but burleys with other components really outshine this beautiful flake, namely Haunted Bookshop. That brings enough outside help, while leaving the burley itself to shine, to make for a slightly superior smoke. Or really, for my tastes, the perfect burley blend. However, for anyone on their burley journey, this is a can’t miss stop along the way.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Haunted Bookshop, Big’N’Burley, Brown/Happy Bogie
 
**Summary:** An elegant and rich, quintessential burley 

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the wonders of moving):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Not being woken up at 2:23 AM on a Tuesday morning by the caterwauling of some drunk frat boy)

(++++) Great (Living in a nicer place with less rent)

(+++) Very good (Hey, I haven’t seen that for years!)

(++) Good (Some of these appliances are at least made this millennium)

(+) I think like it (Playing tetris with all your worldly goods)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Moving fast food)

(-) I think I dislike this (What’s that smell?)

(--)This is not for me (Why do I continue to buy physical books by the literal box load?)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Why does nothing fit?)

(----)This is suffering (Running face first into the wall at night repeatedly because you keep forgetting where you are)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Scrubbing every last inch/centimeter/fathom of two apartments in the same week)
