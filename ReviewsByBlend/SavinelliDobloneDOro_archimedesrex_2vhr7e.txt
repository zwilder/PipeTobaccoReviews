Tobacco Review: Savinelli Doblone d'Oro
By: archimedesrex
---
Blend Name: Doblone d'Oro  

Description on Tin: The choicest Virginias, Burleys and dark fired Kenyan leaf are enhanced with an impeccable addition of spicy Perique, then aged to perfection before being spun into enticingly beautiful, zesty coins. A delightfully vivacious and flavorful smoke.  

Leaf: Dark brown coins with streaks of golden leaf and lighter bits bits. Coins are about the size of nickel.  

Tin Aroma: Smokey and fruity. Smells like barbecued plums.  

Taste: On first light, tasted like savory meat and dark fruit. Steak with plum sauce. I felt like I could eat this smoke. Mild and pleasant spice. After the first half, it kind of mellowed and a vague floral note showed up. It stayed in that state for the rest of the smoke. Delicious through and through.  

Smokability: I very roughly crumbled a few coins with my fingers and just gravity fed it into the bowl and tamped till it felt right in the draw. Came out of the tin dry enough to smoke, but I gave it about 15 extra minutes. Very few relights. Medium nicotine hit.  
 
Room Note: Not sure because I smoked it alone, but the scent didn't linger.  

Thoughts:  All the components play well together. What can I say? This stuff is a home run. Don't know what kind of blend this would be. My gut says American style, but Doblone d'Oro doesn't give me much confidence that this is what Savinelli would consider it. By any name this is a great blend.  

Recommend to: Fans of VaPers, American, or English blends. VaPer smokers wanting to ease into English blends, and vice versa.  

Summary: If you want a rich, delicious, well-rounded blend, try it. 4.5/5  

My Background: Piping for about 2 years, Vas/VaPers/VaBurs/Burs are my favorite types
====================================
tennesseean_87: VA and dark-fired leaf often gets left out of blend genre. I prefer it to VAPer, but those get all the glory.

archimedesrex: I can't say anything bad about the VaPer genre, but this is really good!

shaneireland: Definitely a sleeper. I waited months to give this a go and ever since the first puff, it's been in my regular rotation.

Excellent review! Your description of the taste is spot-on.

carnesy: Damn it, now you're tempting me to crack my tin way earlier then I originally planned too.

pixeechick: Thanks for the review. I didn't get any plums on mine, but I agree that it's a fantastic blend. When I get a job that moves me back to North America I'll be celebrating by stocking a cellar. This blend absolutely makes the cut.
