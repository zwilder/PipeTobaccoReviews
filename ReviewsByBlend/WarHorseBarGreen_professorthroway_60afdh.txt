Tobacco Review: War Horse Bar green
By: professor_throway

* Blend Name: War Horse Bar Green

* Description on Tin: War Horse Green uses the same base tobaccos as War Horse Bar, but with a unique and decidedly more aromatic top note than the original. There are notes here similar to a number of European tobaccos, but made here in the US. Give this singular take on Euro-style blends a try. We think you'll be back time and again.

* Cut: I was expecting more of a true plug. This is really a very dense crumble cake. You don't need a knife just break off a but and it rubs out to a chunky ribbon.

* Tin Aroma: Deep anise and tonquin (like 1792 flake). Floral. Herbal scent that was familiar but took me a while to figure out. Someone on tobacco reviews mentioned valerian room. Smelled some essential oil from one of those aromatherapy places and it was dead on. Smell of base tobaccos is largely absent.

* Taste: Rich and deep flavor. The dark fired cuts through the toppings but the other components sit in the back. Tastes like a cheroot that was in an explosion in an apothecary. You catch hints of the sweetness from the red Va intermittently. The anise is powerful. The floral and perfume notes are strong but not defined. I couldn't say rose-gernamium or violet. It is more abstract. Tonquin is persistent but not over the top. Very consistent flavor from the top of the bowl to the bottom. 

* Strength: In between Irish Flake and 1792. It is strong, but apparently the Red seems stronger even though it is the same base tobaccos. I smoke it in small bowls, sitting down. Have a sweet drink on hand if you are a nic wimp. Feel it a bit in the throat, didn't make my knees wobble.

* Smokability: Rubs out easy. Half hour of dry time. Packs and burns no problem. Slow burning. No dottle, but some moisture (I keep a pipe cleaner on hand, but I tend to be a wet smoker).

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. In the garage there is a lingering menthol floral scent in the air.

* Thoughts: Picked up a tin on a whim from P&C for free shipping. I am really really liking it. The strength of the topping is obnoxious but still excellent. It is like marshmallow ambrosia salad, it sounds weird but somehow all the flavors come together for something good. The topping doesn't come across as medicinal or astringent. The dark fired is the only tobacco taste I really get, which is good because I love dark fired. I have never tried Condor but if this is in the same family, I really need to get some. Will likely ghost a pipe pretty strongly. I have been smoking it out of a small Grabow Rhodesian I rescued from a flea market. 

* Recommend to: Someone who likes strong tobacco with very full flavors. Must like anise and tonquin. Lakeland fans will rejoice. 
 
* Summary: Unlike anything I ever smoked. Very strong toppings that almost completely overpower the tobacco taste. Who spilled perfume on my licorice? Somehow it all works and tastes great.

* My Background: Cigarette smoke for 20 years. Quit 8 years ago and intermittently smoked a pipe or cigar. In the last year picked up the pipe much more and smoke about 5 bowls a week.
====================================
zero-hunter: Great review. I'm eager to crack my own tin, but I'm definitely a nic wimp. Nightcap gives me a brutal headache.

professor_throway: It is pretty potent. Try it in a really small bowl.

misterzipp0: Awesome review!

Doc_Hooligan: I'm looking forward to trying it, if it ever gets here.

mugwump867: I threw a can into my IPSD P&C order that finally arrived last week and the smell coming from this supposedly sealed can was of a very intense licorice.  Good thing I like licorice.  Can't wait to try it.

====================================
Arrogus: Seems like I can't get this stuff to light, no matter ho much I dry it out.
--
professor_throway: Weird how different tobaccos work for different folks. I had no problem with it. Maybe try a lighter pack?
--
Arrogus: Good idea; I'll give it a try tonight.

====================================
TheMadPeterson: I really wanted to like it, but the anise is just way too strong. I left it in a jar, hoping that it would mellow out a bit.

Having tried Condor, it's a different beast. I prefer Condor, but it's not really feasible to stock up on without spending a small fortune. I'll be sticking with GH&C for my floral needs.

mcbooties: Tried it last night. I got it for the free shipping on P&C. I loved it! I used my Karl Erik freehand for the first time for this occasion. I figured it was a "War Horse" looking pipe. It was strong, flavorful and wouldn't stop burning. It has an almost incense like quality, but is also quite tasty. Not a daily, but it's a fun experience.
