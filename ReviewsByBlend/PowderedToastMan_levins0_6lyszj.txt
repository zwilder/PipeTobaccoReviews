Powdered Toast Man: A review of a Reddit Blend

Thanks to linearone and coldsolderjoint for the sample.  This is a fun blend!  I tasted it on the hangout tonight real-time with linearone, which was fun.

**Pipe:** I smoked this in a Falcon with a small briar bowl.

**Appearance:** This is a ribbon cut blend of a few different tobaccos, nicely balanced.  Some lighter bits and some darker (probably cavendish).  Topped and a little wet, but not overly goopy.

**Tin note:** Sugary, like syrup and something slightly vanilla, like a marshmallow.  Just a little nuttiness.  A little spice, like a cake, not pepper.  

**Initial light:** Nice body, more full than many other aromatics I've had.  No harshness at all.  Very smooth and bread-like, with a general sweetness.

**Taste:** The bowl matures as it goes, and really hits its stride in the middle third.  The spice wakes up, and I do get hints of cinnamon, but just barely.  It's not candy/redhot cinnamon, but a real french toasty cinnamon which works nicely with the syrup and toastiness.  

**Smokability:** Despite being somewhat wet, it lit easily and stayed lit.  I dried it out for a little while, about 20 minutes.  I didn't have to relight, which surprised me.  I smoked it on a very humid night with thunderstorms, and the end of the bowl got wet and steamy, and somewhat bitter because of that.  I didn't get any bite, though, which also surprised me.

**Rating:** For an aromatic, I'd give it a solid 4/5 stars.  I'm not a huge aro smoker, but this was a nice blend with more interesting flavors than the usual aro.

Thanks again for the sample.  I had fun smoking this!

chewsyourownadv: ... Both of them?

====================================
chewsyourownadv: Do you have any Classic Samsun or Katerini Classic on hand? I just smoked my last bit of PTM with about 20% Classic Samsun. It added the buttery note I thought it would, but diminished the original taste too much. I'm thinking maybe 10-15% would hit the spot.

levins0: I do! I have a second bowl of ptm so I'll give it a try. Thanks!
