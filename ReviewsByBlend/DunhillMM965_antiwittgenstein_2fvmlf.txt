Tobacco Review: Dunhill My Mixture 965

Review #9

**Blend Name:** Dunhill 965

**Description on Tin:** Of all of the Dunhill tobaccos, My Mixture 965 is a true classic, even having been inducted into the Pipe Tobacco Hall of Fame. Great Virginias are blended with select Macedonian Orientals and a good amount of rich Latakia. What sets 965 apart is the addition of brown Cavendish, which deepens the blend and adds a subtle hint of mellow sweetness.
 
**Leaf:** Medium ribbon in yellow, brown, and black. Quite dry to the touch. Still, it burns a bit better given some drying time.

**Tin Aroma:** Smoky, gunpowder, citrus, musty, like an old house in the middle of August wilting with disuse, age, and Sherman's humilation.  

**Taste:** In my bent pot: From the first light, it is full, tangy, slightly sweet, soapy, lavender like, smoky, cordite, almost salty. Is that charred bacon? Surely. Now red wine vinegar, some sherry. Then orange juice (Tropicana no pulp, the one with the fake orange flavoring). Snatches of black pepper pop out - the flavor more than spice. Deeper in the bowl it has a nutty center, mellow cashew if I had to be more descriptive. Spoke too soon on the spice, it ramps up and in a big way - and then suddenly, it is gone, back to a well natured smoky lavender. Odd that. The spice comes and goes, building as you go down. Comes a bit ashy at the end.

I remember liking this more in my first pipe, a standard bent briar, so I gave it a second go. 

The first part is all the same, but the lavender-soapy flavor is muted, while the campfire smoke taste comes out. I get many of the same notes, though not as distinctly, but the vinegar, citrus, virginia flavors are much more dominant, so it tends to be a spicy, Lapsang Souchong infused virginia, less a nutty, lavender deal. As you get to the end this becomes even more evident. It behaves even better here, not hitting an ashy end like in the wide pot. 

This is pretty stout for my low tolerance. The nicotine hits me on the first puff and keeps going, feeling like a giant hand pushing on my spine. Usually have to set the pipe aside a few times. 

**Smokability:** Pretty easy to light, minimal relights, burns to a fine ash. A champ.

**Room Note:** Burning leaves and wood smoke on a cool autumn night. I like it. I smell manly.

**Thoughts:** Well you have probably smoked this and know what it's about. You haven't? Oh my, my apologies for assuming. Go correct that at the soonest possible occasion. 

I bought my pot just so I could get more flavor out of the English blends. Funny enough, I prefer this in a slightly taller bowl, my all around bowl as it were. Perhaps because it mutes some of the soapy-floral flavors in favor of my dear beloved virginia citrus twang. So for me it is a solid ++++ in a pot, and a whopping +++++ in a somewhat narrower bowl. I suggest you give this a whirl in a few varying shapes - if you have the luxury - and see what kind of experience you prefer. 

This is the fullest flavored tobacco I have had. If you have struggled to get a satisfactory experience from your aros, otcs, burleys, or virginias, never fear. You will be knocked over with this one. In the future I am going to recommend this as a solid beginner smoke. It packs and lights easily and cannot, for a moment, be confused with smoking hot air.  

**Summary:** A rite of passage virginia forward English blend which lives up to its considerable hype.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 8 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
CaptLinus: Nice review.  As a physicist,  I found your review scale amusing.
--
antiwittgenstein: I'm only a lowly engineer, so I might have a skewed viewpoint from your perspective.

====================================
tankbuster183: Awesome review.  I love 965; even though I don't smoke every day, I never get the nicotine hit that everyone mentions.  I love the quote about the manly smell, totally agree.
--
abcdthc: Whats your usual smoke?

(I dont get the nic hit either)
--
tankbuster183: I don't have a real usual; I don't even smoke every day, so that's why I'm suprised it doesn't hit me harder.  I've heard a lot of people say that about the nicotine content.

I'm into the Frog Morton's right now, but I like 965 to 1Q.  Almost have gotten out of aromatics though.

====================================
pixeechick: Thanks for the review. I've had a tin in my cellar for almost a year now; I'll open that next once I finish this Standard Mixture I'm working on.

====================================
daneelthesane: A tin of this was gifted to me by a friend who picked it up in Sweden (I think... or Germany... he travels to both a lot for work), and it has sat on my shelf for a year and a half. However, I just recently learned to appreciate latakias, so I might have to give it a go after reading this.
--
====================================
abcdthc: Mmm 965.  Its a go to for me.  Im never sorry when I have a pipe full of 965 in my mouth.

It tastes like what i think a pipe should taste like.  Just all that great leather and campfire and subtle rye bread and spice.

Im surprised you say the N hit is strong.  I feel this blend is a little weak.  (I do smoke VaPers and the regular and 3 nuns is a new favorite of mine)

If you havent tried EMP I highly reccomend it.  

Also as fan of HH Kake, have you tried Escudo?  It really is fantastic.
--
antiwittgenstein: Escudo is on my next to try list.

I try to give the caveat that I have no nicotine tolerance - I am a low mass individual, I have no natural nicotine tolerance, and no matter how often I smoke, it never builds up. So what is a heavy smoke to me is often a virtually nicotine free blend for others.
--
abcdthc: Fair enough.  I smoked cig's for almost 20 years so nicotine is pretty much converted to riboflavin in my body at this point.

i still think straight VA and certin perique blends can be a little heavy.  I think 3 nuns is right on the money for the N hit.  

Escudo is is a little potent.  Its very shy on the perique.  The VA is OUTSTANDING though.  Just killer. Like "mmm, damn thats good, yeah, mmm"

Thats how I sound when smoking Escudo :)

====================================
arfenhouse: Good review. I didn't find 965 to be as enjoyable as you did but it was solid smoke and like the other DHs burned extremely well.

====================================
jimjimwest: Awesome review!  I'm adding/stealing 'Sherman's humiliation' to my personal lexicon :-)

Darwin7848: A.W. you are such a W.I.M.P.
