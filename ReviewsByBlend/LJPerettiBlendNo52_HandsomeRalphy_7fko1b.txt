**Name**: LJ Peretti Blend No. 52

**Type**: Burley

**Leaf & Cut**: Ribbon Cut - Burley,Virginia, Turkish

**Aroma**: LJP Burley Aroma, Vinegar, Citrus, Something Sour (couldn't quite place it)

**Description**: A distinct blend of burley, red Virginia and Dubeck brought back to life by the blenders at Peretti. This mixture offers sweetness and subtle piquancy. Currently available in limited quantities. (via LJ Peretti)

**Thoughts**:  I couldn't just order a brick of Thanksgiving Day when I placed my last order from LJP. It would seem like such a waste not to get something else. I opted to throw some Blend 52 on that order. 

After having this blend sitting in a jar for around 20 days or so, I figured it would be a good day to give it a whirl. First thing I noticed was the scent of the jar when I opened it. That lovely scent of Peretti Burley, and a subtley nostril-stinging scent of vinegar. I knew I was in for something I would love. Once the bowl was going, the familiar flavors overcame my tastes. The nutty & earthy burley, the sweet grassy-citrus virginias, and then something I was not used to in my usual blends. An odd sour taste. Not a bad or overwhelming sour, but more sour akin to drinking a sour beer. 
This I could only attribute to the Dubeck. A lovely flavor of spicy, sour, and sweet all at the same time. It may not dethrone my other beloved LJP blends, but I could see it finding it's way into my rotation when I am looking for something different.

====================================
ThePipeSigh: I agree with your assessment. I thought it was quite tasty, and the Dubeck allowed for a very distinct flavor. The jar aroma, to me, was like orange juice. I often smoked it after breakfast. I'll probably get some more.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice review - I've never even heard of Dubeck. Must be a fairly individual blend. Is this stuff in anyway comparable to Old Joe Krantz, or is the sour a different breed altogether?
--
HandsomeRalphy: Unfortunately I have not had Old Joe Krantz, so I can't compare the two. The sour doesn't ruin anything in the blend, just adds a nice contrast to the sweetness of it.

chewsyourownadv: Different breed. I'm not convinced the sourness comes from LJP's burley, having jarred up quite a bit of it. There is sometimes the faintest hint of a topping, perhaps an unintentional ghosting carried over from blending things in the same shop, but that fades fast. #52, however, has almost nothing in common with crotchety Old Joe, not even after he's been confined to a jar for a year and mellowed a bit.
