Blend Name: Hearth & Home: Magnum Opus

Tin Description: The Latin term Magnum Opus loosely translates to “masterpiece”, and this is how we, and our early testers think of this new release. Magnum Opus is a blend of Cyprian Latakia, excellent yellow Virginias from the U.S. and Bulgaria, Izmir, Basma and the “Queen of Tobaccos”, Yenidje. Then we add some Perique to give it more depth and smoothness. Here’s a quote from well-known pipe and tobacco collector Fred Goldring, who tested Magnum Opus during development: ”I immediately searched my mind to recall what vintage tobacco this sample best represented. Every time I put a name to it the blend again changed and the taste shifted to another and yet another blend from the past, all of which I stock in my cellar and all of which I enjoy very much. I decided to smoke the last half of the bowl that I started the evening before. Believe it or not the second half was more magical than the first. I walked in and out of my smoking room a number of times this evening and each time the exquisite aroma of this blend became more apparent. If you make a ton I will purchase half. This, my friend is a world class tobacco born out of the magic of Russ O”. We sampled this blend to a number of people at the CORPS, West Coast and New York pipe shows, and the feedback was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The flavor, aroma and burning characteristics have been almost universally praised. Give Magnum Opus a try and we feel confident that you’ll be back for more.

Aroma: Pure Tobacco. Spice, campfire and a rich earthiness.

Appearance: Surprising amount of tan thick ribbons intermingled with blacks

Gravity packed into my 2012 Nording Hunting Pipe: White Mountain Sheep

Flavor: 
Initial: Definite pumpkin pie spice. Clove, cinnamon and nutmegs. Very interesting start!

Mid: Spice has mellowed out with the VA and Lat coming to the forefront, but certainly it's hard to distinguish any specific component. Every ingredient in this blend harmonizes excellently with its counterparts, making individual parts a bit tough to suss out. Chewy dried fruit notes with a nice round nuttiness. Add to that just the slightest bit of acidic twang and this is quite the pleasurable smoke. 

Final: I am quickly falling in love with this blend. Smokes very dry and cool. 

Thoughts: This blend is rich and flavorful without being in your face. This blend, in my opinion, demonstrates the art of blend making so well. Harmonious at the very least, tasty at it's very best. 
====================================
youfuckerstookallthe: I really like magnum opus, but black house just seemed fuller and creamier to me. Did yours arrive extremely dry? Mine was like autumn leaves and I think that affected how it smoked.

physicsyakuza: It wasn't super dry. It was sitting in a mason jar, but I don't think I added any moisture.

====================================
somedumbjerk: I'm very picky about Latakia. I'm honestly not a fan of it. Penzance and magnum opus are two that I reach for whenever I get the bug. This is a wonderful blend that has some of the best balance I've ever smoked. Russ is truly a great blender. Also try Larry's blend for a more straight forward lat blend. Still really good.

physicsyakuza: I've never had Larry's blend, I'll definitely pick up an ounce! Black House is tonight's pick so I'm curious to see how they stack up back to back.

====================================
RoydnJr: I finally had a backordered bulk amount arrive. Jarred it, but never tried it. Your review is making me seriously consider popping that lid open!
