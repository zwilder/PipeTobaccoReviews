[Tobacco Review] Ashton: Artisan's Blend
By: DrScience11
---
**Blend Name**: Ashton- "Artisan's Blend"

**Description on Tin**:This full-bodied English mixture is carefully crafted for the experienced pipe smoker. Virginia and Turkish tobaccos harmonize with Syrian Latakia and a touch of Perique to create a taste that is resoundingly rich, spicy and satisfying.

**Looks**: Mostly dark, crinkled black ribbons, with muted browns mixed in and the occasional flash of a dull yellow Virginia.  The cut is of very short, densely packed and shriveled ribbons.

**Tin Aroma**: The usual from an English blend, but the campfire smoke is a bit more...rounded.  Moisture from the breath brings out a roasty, nutty like note (maybe chessnuts?) as well as something akin to damp earth.  The astute nose will detect a bit of sweetness from the Virginia's mixed in, which personally reminds me a bit of a black tea.  The sweetness and the nutty notes keep the blend from smelling sharply of smoke, and instead makes a warmer, rounder aroma.

**Taste**: The roundness of the aroma comes out in the flavors, which I like to describe to people as a "silkier nightcap".  The Latakia tastes closer to Cyprian, and I'm not convinced it's actually Syrian Latakia.  The smokey flavors are soft and gentle on the top note, opening up to a spicy and robust finish thanks to the Perique and Turkish tobaccos.  This blend tastes similar to nightcap, but what I expect are higher percentages of the Turkish tobacco tends to "smooth out" the smoke.  Whereas the Perique in Nightcap peppers the tongue and makes a rather sharp flavor, everything here muddles together nicely.  The Virginia is not inherently detectable, as the stronger flavors from the English tobaccos overwhelm it.  The finish is nice, nutty, and a bit earthy.

**Room Note**: Surprisingly sweet.  There must be some interesting chemistry going on here as the aroma from the pipe smells of a rich Virginia, reminding me of something stout like a Red Cake.  The aroma from the exhaled smoke is, however, strictly English.  The combination of the English flavors from the pipe, combined with that sweet Virginia scent from the bowl makes for an interesting room note, if nothing else.

**Smokeability** : The ribbon packs easily, and the tobacco is the right kind of damp out of the tin or in the jar.  The blend tends to smoke wet, and burns through rather fast for an English.  Due to the wetness, it has a tendency to go out if not packed just so.  Despite these shortcomings, it does deliver on the cool smoke one would expect from an English.  I smoked this blend mostly in a Meerschaum, but twice in a Briar reserved for English blends.

**Compare to** : Nightcap, for sure.  Also nuttier, more Oriental based English blends like Squadron Leader by Sam Gawith comes to mind.  As well as something like Engine 99, from Cornell and Diehl.

**Summary**: A lovley blend for the winter, especially for those of you who like complex and spicey blends, but don't really care for high concentrations of Perique.  I again like to describe it as a rounder or silkier Nightcap.  There are a lot of very nice, rich flavors, which all muddle superbly to make a balanced blend.  My one complaint would be that although there are a lot of flavors, and the roomnote is rather curious, nothing really shines through as novel.  The flavors are all good, but standard.  The mouthfeel nice, but not unprecedented.  The smoke cool, but wet and short.  The balance between all these things is really what shines here, but the items being balanced as in themselves rather mundane.  I would strongly recommend this to someone who enjoyed the flavor of Nightcap, but disliked the spice flavors and mouthfeel from the high Perique concentration.

I would also like to think my lovely girlfriend's kind father, who gave me this excellent tobacco for the holidays.

**Rating** : 3.5/5

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak, Samuel Gawith's Full Virginia Flake, Dunhill Flake, and Dunhill's Nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of Virginia and English blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q and Dan's Blue Note. I've been piping for almost 2.5 years now  I really enjoy complexity in my tobacco, and shy away from 1-shot blends.

sarum52: Excellent review. All fine selections in your background.  The girlfriend is a keeper.

DrScience11: Ah, thank you on both account.  I'm glad you share my favorites.  I like to joke that I should get money from Peterson, because I feel like I popularized Irish Oak on this sub long ago.  Reviewed it, recommended it a ton, traded it a lot.  I even put it in the FAQ!
--
sarum52: Based on your review, I will try and buy the Artisan's Blend this week.  Cheers.
