[Review] Solani 660: Silver Flake

**Blend Name:** Solani 660: Silver Flake

**Description on Tin:** An incredible blend of premium dark red and sweet Virginias from the "border belt", light yellow Virginia from South Carolina and dark-fired, spicy Kentucky. Slow burning and because no flavoring has been added, this blend has a real tobacco taste.

**Leaf:** Kentucky and Virginias, long flakes of light brown tobacco interspersed with flecks of light and dark. 

**Tin Aroma:** Bright citrus, but more of a lemon on fish type of citrus, with a side note of hay. Basically if you had some lovely fish sprinkled with lemon put on a bed of hay you'd know what I'm getting at. It's actually a rather enticing experience.

**Taste:** Hay in the fall, almost a leather overtone. Light citrus on the retro. An overlaying sweetness to every puff. A bit of background spice that kept me thinking that there much be Perique in there. There's a woodsy note in there that drifts in and out of consciousness. Later in the bowl theres a nutty bread taste that makes an appearance and stays for the rest of the smoke. Thankfully that fishy smell never makes an appearance once lit, or maybe that's a tragedy?

**Smokability:** It arrives in a non sealed bag inside a non vacuum sealed tin, so it was bone dry on arrival, I rehydrated. I've had no problems with lighting or with keeping it lit. It's a delight in that you can ignore it and focus on enjoying the smoke itself.

**Room Note:** Pleasant, there's a hint of cigarette but sweeter, so while not terrible it's not great. Maybe that's where the fish got to?

**Thoughts:** I got this to get a taste of pure leaf tobacco, I honestly didn't really know what I was getting in to other than it was very well reviewed and sounded intriguing. My first impression of it was not great since it ships unsealed, which is a great tragedy in my mind, I got it jarred pretty quickly and basically forgot about it till warmer months. The flake themselves are beautiful long cuts, once rehydrated it's incredibly easy to prepare however you like it to smoke. I haven't found much of a difference between rubbing it out versus folding and stuffing but it should be noted that it was as easy to light up after being folded and stuffed as it was rubbed out. This is not up in your face and I really really liked that about it, it's very tasty with no tongue bite or sharpness. I jarred it into two jars, which I'm pretty excited to see how it ages in the second jar I'm not smoking out of. My only complaints against this tobacco are the afore mentioned unsealed tin and the cost of it is a bit steep, especially considering the lack of a seal. With that being said you'd be hard pressed not to enjoy this tobacco once you've shown it a little love and care after the abuse it was given by being put in that, albeit beautiful, tin.

**Recommend to:** Anyone who wants to experience tobacco for it's natural flavors, VaPer lovers will probably find something here as well. 

**Summary:** I like this tobacco, I really like this tobacco, I like it so much that I don't mind putting up with the cigarette smell that comes afterwards. If I haven't already mentioned it please know that it does come in an unsealed tin so it should be jarred immediately when it's received. You should really smoke this tobacco if given the chance, even without the chance get it, you'll not regret it.

**Final Rating:** 4/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for a year and a half with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Mortons Cellar, White Knight (To be potentially ousted by Silver Flake), and Quiet Nights.

====================================
crimsonrat: This is one of my absolute favorites. The only reason I don't buy more is the tin. Great review.

crimblade: Thanks!

It's a real shame since there's no way the drying out and rehydration doesn't have a big impact on the flavor. 

On the other hand I wonder if that might be part of what gives it it's great flavor, maybe we wouldn't like it so much if it didn't get abused first?

crimsonrat: Maybe so. I've never gotten a tin so dry that I had to rehydrate, but it's been close. I'm too lazy to get it in quantity to jar up, so I've got 1 jar just for it.
