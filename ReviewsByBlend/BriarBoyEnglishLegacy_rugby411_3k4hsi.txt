Review: "English Legacy" u/BriarBoy's English/Balkan

The second I saw u/BriarBoy had come up with an English/Balkan ribbon cut I emailed him to get some to try. It arrived SO quickly and after impatiently waiting the work day out I ran home, patted the kids on the head, grabbed the dog and took off on a walk to give it a spin. 

After 3 bowls of it over the long weekend, here are my thoughts:

My initial impression is that this blend is quite a bit "lighter" than I expected. The tin note is pure spice. Opening note is savory/peppery, a solid Latakia with definite Orientals and quite a bit of leather, pine, sawdust, and spice. The moisture level is on point and required no drying time. It packed easily into my Castello Sea Rock Full Bent Billiard. The bowl took a match well and after the false light I was good to go. Opening taste was definitely Oriental with a nice aftertaste of juniper and maybe some cardamon. Really nice taste right out of the gate.

I was expecting to spend the next hour with a big, spicy, heavy latakia, but what I got instead, was more subtle and complex. Not as full as I'd expect and prefer a Balkan to be, to be honest, but that's not a bad thing. Some folks think Balkans HAVE to be big, but this is a good solid county road next to the interstate. I'd compare it to a simple, bourbon rocks, both in taste and complexity; it's well-balanced and well blended. The flavor for the next 1/2 bowl was rich pine campfire, really nice medium volume Oriental, and subtle perique ...rich and smoky, with a backseat sharpness that was a possible red flag for tongue-bite, but that never materialized. The tobacco never got too hot and wasn't moist; it never once gurgled. 

This is not a quick, fast smoke...I walked the dog for a good hour and maybe made it 3/4 of the way through the bowl. However, I found that if smoked (sipped) fairly slowly, the taste stays with you for quite a while and it was pretty mild on the tongue. It burned cool and dry and left a clean light ash behind.
I'm told the room note, despite the Latakia, was tolerable and reminded folks of a "pine-y" incense. The nicotine aspect of it was pretty mild. All in all it's a good, mild smoke. 
Really great job u/BriarBoy! This will definitely be one that I take with me camping with my sons or on long hikes.
