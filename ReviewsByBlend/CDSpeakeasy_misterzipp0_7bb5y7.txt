[Review] C&D Speakeasy (long)

C&D Speakeasy, a nighttime cocktail for both you and your pipe.

I found myself very restless after my mid evening shift and while my body (and feet) were tired I knew that if I dozed off with my mind racing as it was my sleep would be quick and I would wake up more tired than before.  I didn't really want a cocktail as my belly was too full from dinner so I though a bowl full of Speakeasy in one of my (many) bankers would do the trick.  

I got sidetracked by my Blue Oranda, Crump, who has been dealing with some serious swim bladder issues so I tended to her and then grabbed a few chunks of this broken flake, hit it with a 6 second blast from our beastly 1100 watt microwave, balled, stuffed, and twisted and then ambled out to the porch.

My fancy lighter dies halfway through my charring lights so I grabbed the rim scorcher crackhead BIC that's on the table and, trying my best not to scorch the rim, set fire to the chunks and watched them rise up to greet this damp night like a firecracker snake.

I won't lie, the first few puffs on this blend are always ashy and nasty for me, like stale cigarettes.  Once that passes I'm walloped by the boozy topping [rum] and the maple/molasses from the dark fired.  Perhaps this is coincidence or the folks at C&D are pure genius because that's exactly what entering a speakeasy embodies, a whiff of thick cigarette smoke and then booze, and lots of it!

As I work through the charring lights, yes, lights plural, this one takes several as I smoke it wetter than my other blends so I can bask in that sweet rum taste, the orientals start to come out with their incense and dry heat.  I really like blends that feature orientals without the accompanying Goodyear tire factory fire of Latakia polluting my pipe.  Ok, they have their place I guess, but it's a rare occasion for me.   I feel like they add a certain white taste to a blend that is somewhere between white pepper and the smell of dry tea leaves.

The perique comes on fast and strong like an overbearing barfly, except this one is a looker and you wouldn't mind to take her home.  Sadly she heads to another table and you only see her from a distance.  Oh well, perhaps that's for the best as a pretty lady has sat down beside you and ordered a cocktail for her. And then one for you.  

The dark fired has come back in spades and it's here to stay.  It's smoky, sweet, and unlike other brands it is not *as* perfumey as MacBaren's Navy Flake, this one is darker and more oak forward.  There is a sweetness to it but it's not bright, it's true maple; woody and a bit of vanilla with some dark brown sugar.  This complements the rum in the best way possible and as the nicotine starts to set in I remember why I prefer this one late in the evening.  Everything about this blend is smoky and dark, it makes me feel like I'm in an old haunt and the nicotine helps me feel very relaxed, I don't even mind that this blend tends to need a bit more fussing than I would like.  

Midbowl sees the orientals bringing their sour tang to the table and the retrohale enhances their subtle spice.  I wonder how much perique is really in this blend?  It's hard to tell with three components that all bring in a different spice but I'm thinking it can't be more than a dash as it doesn't outshine any of the others.

We're staring to get a little wet so I run a pipe cleaner down the stem and give it a good light and the booze fires right back up.  This isn't the Captain, nope, this is a dark rum, a navy rum that lacks all the kitchen sink spices to cover up its cheap alcohol but relies on pure distilled goodness to bring about the best brown flavors you can think of; demerara, oak, molasses, etc.

More fussing is required as I have packed this way too tight so I stir up the bowl, run the other end of the cleaner down the stem, and set light to the bowl.  That's better, the draw has opened up and the orientals are coming back around and the smoke itself is drier.

At this point it's on to a French inhale alternating with retrohaling so I can really enjoy the nicotine rush this one brings in.  I try not to French it too much but it's so intoxicating that I can't help it.  The perique peaks out at me and all the warm spices are there, it's heavenly.  This blend isn't for the faint of heart, it's dark, spicy, nic heavy and delicious.

I've waxed on about this one enough so time to put the phone down and enjoy the sounds of a neighborhood asleep as I revel in my nic rush through the end of the bowl.

Colors smoked in this blend are brown, white, and purple. 

The nicotine isnt the heaviest I've smoked but it's higher up there than most, 8/10.

I'd recommend picking up two tins as it's sublime fresh but I can only imagine what a few years will do for it.
