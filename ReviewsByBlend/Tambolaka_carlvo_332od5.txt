[Review] Tambolaka
By: carlvon

====================================
carlvon: Here is my review on Tambolaka as requested by a few people. This is my everyday smoke, and it's hard to find a true review online for it. Most reviews say to grab your crash helmet, or that it will knock you out. I do not find that to be true, and I'd like to bring this unique tobacco into the realm of what most would call a "normal" everyday tobacco.

**Blend Name -** Tambolaka

**Description on Tin -** On an exotic island in southern Indonesia the village warriors, who still wear swords everyday and live in towering bamboo huts, create one of the world's richest and most powerful tobaccos. Tambolaka tobacco is organically grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers, it is picked and air dried and then rolled into 9 feet long sticks to age of 5 years in the village's huts. We at Tambolaka Natural Tobaccos then offer it to tobacco lovers worldwide in traditional sticks and in precut form to be enjoyed in pipes and hand rolled cigarettes. A full flavored highly relaxing tobacco, we are proud to offer you this exciting taste of exotic Indonesia!

**Leaf -** I haven't been able to find a vendor that has the rope wrapped sticks, so I'm reviewing the ready rubbed version of Tambolaka in this review. The tobacco is a combination of ribbon, cube, and broken flake. It's basically cut coins from the stick that were then rubbed out and cut. The leaf is dark and very oily. The moisture is perfect fresh out of the pouch, and the roughness of the cut matches perfectly with the taste of the tobacco.

**Tin Aroma -** It's a bit hard to pin down on this tobacco. If you just smell the tobacco without trying, you will only get ammonia; however, if you really concentrate and dig deeper, you will be able to detect the hint of hay or straw and cedar. It's almost like opening a well stocked cigar humidor and taking a whiff. You can smell the sweet smell of oily tobacco, Spanish cedar, and some sort of straw bedding.

**Dry Draw -** When testing how I packed the bowl, I taste dirt lightly sweetened with molasses.

**Initial Light -** The initial light is reminiscent of a shade Connecticut cigar - not unlike an Oliva Connecticut Reserve.

**Taste:** 

*Top Note -* There's a light hint of molasses and a dark burley that's more pronounced on the retrohale. The flavors are very balanced, and nothing is very over powering.

*Big Notes -* What really stands out with this blend is the tobacco taste. It's a very full flavored smoke that is thick, creamy, and mildly sweet until the end. There's a hint of leather and earth that stays the same throughout the entire bowl.

*Finish -* Considering the full flavor of this tobacco, the finish is very light. You're left with sweet molasses flavored dirt, but nothing is heavy or off putting.

*Inhale -* While not for the faint of heart, inhaling Tambolaka brings a taste not unlike an unfiltered cigarette.

*French Inhale -* French inhaling brings out a BBQ ash taste of wood - again, not unlike a cigarette.

*Flavor Development -* As you would expect with a flavor this full, the taste remains consistent throughout the entire bowl. The only thing that develops is a bit of spiciness once you get halfway through the bowl. It's not quite an oriental or perique spice - more like the spice from a good Corojo cigar. It's not over powering, but it is there.

**Room note -** The room note is reminiscent of walking into a bar when it first opens for the day. There's a hint of leather and stale cigarette smoke that doesn't last long.

**Thoughts -** Wow, the tobacco flavor is strong with this one. It is high in nicotine, but I have never been one to really be affected by it. I really enjoy this blend, and it never bites. It is just a good, down to earth tobacco flavor that is very unique and not unlike a full flavored cigar. Make sure you don't pack in too tight, and enjoy the experience.

**Recommend to:** I would recommend this tobacco to someone that likes full flavored cigars, or that really likes the raw taste of an oily tobacco.

**Summary -** I really enjoy this tobacco, and it is a daily smoke for me. I'll usually smoke a bowl when I get home from work, and I'll usually have one or two more before I go to bed. It always smokes cool, doesn't bite, and requires very minimal maintenance. I only have to relight a few times, but that's mainly due to my inattention. It always finishes to a grey white ash.

**My Background -** I was a long time cigarette smoker. I quit smoking for about 8 years, and then started smoking cigars. I enjoy full flavor cigars, and the stronger the better. About 3 years ago, I was spending more money than I wish to admit smoking cigars everyday, and decided I needed to find something that would give me a similar experience without spending $10+/day. That's when I started getting into pipe tobacco.

pixeechick: Excellent review. There were some parts of the review (like the dry draw) that I've not seen on other pipe tobacco reviews that I found quite interesting. The tobacco itself sounds wonderfully terrifying. I like a full-bodied taste, but not sure if I could handle the Vitamin N. Since you also smoke Black XX, how do they compare for nicotine?

Edit: I seemed to be commenting as you uploaded pictures. That's the coarsest cut leaf I've ever seen. Do you do anything to it before packing? 
--
carlvon: Thanks. The dry draw is something that's popular for cigar reviews, and I thought it fitting to include for this blend.

Surprisingly, the nicotine is not as strong in the Tambolaka as it is in the Black XX. The SW Black XX can give me the hiccups if I don't smoke it slow enough.

The cut is very interesting, and the only thing special I do is run out the really thick chunks and pack it loose.

xDemagog: Awesome review. Reminded me of the last time I smoked it. I found it quite spicy but my little sample might have been a bit dry by then. 
--
carlvon: Thanks. It does have spice, but I think of it more like I'm smoking a cigar, and it doesn't bother me.

====================================
dashn64: Great review mate. Thanks for doing it! You've sold it to me, definitely picking some up (when I get it in I'll try to share my thought's on it). Just a few questions...:

- Do you find it needs to be rubbed out further before smoking?

- Is it dry when you get it and need to re-hydrate it?

- Have you aged it for a few years to see if it changes the taste?; and

- Does any other tobacco compare? I've been told that if I can't find Tambo to pick up some Brown Irish Twist, which I have, but I think that's more just for the nicotine.

Again, thanks for the review, one of the best I've seen. Take care.

carlvon: Thanks.

There are a few thick chunks that I'll rub down, but it's fit for smoking as is.

The ready rubbed version is perfectly moist out of the pouch, but the stick version requires preparation as it's as dry as a rock.

It never lasts long enough for me to age it, but it comes with 5 years on it already. I'm not sure it would change much because it smokes more like a burley. I am going to age some SW Black XX and see how that goes.

I haven't found another tobacco that has a similar taste, but there are those that will give you a similar nic hit. Most of the twists have a good amount of nic (sometimes even more nic than the Tambolaka), but they just don't have the earth and spice. Tambolaka is very similar to a maduro cigar. Semois is probably the closest you can come to taste, but even that is very different.

dashn64: Brilliant, thanks for answering my questions.

Definitely going to pick some up soon. Just bought a new pipe for my birthday (nothing wrong with buying yourself a present!) but next 4noggins order I'll get a pouch! Actually really excited.

crimsonrat: I don't see "feet" anywhere in your descriptors.
--
carlvon: Haha! It's not that bad, but it is a very strong taste that's not for everyone.

fernando_69: have you owned property in Portland?

bonehed: On the list it goes - thanks for the review!

carlvon: Glad you enjoyed it.

====================================
Eyeforthis: There was someone who was awesome enough to hand some out on this subreddit a long time ago. I thought the flavor was awesome, but I'm one of those people who get affected by the "ines" when getting that large amount. Really knocked me on my ass. 
--
carlvon: SW Black XX has more of a nic hit for me. If I don't smoke that stuff slow, it will knock me on my ass.
