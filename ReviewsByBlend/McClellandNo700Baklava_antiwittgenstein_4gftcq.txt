Tobacco Review: McClelland No. 700 Baklava
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 68

**Blend Name:** McClelland Baklava (No. 700)
 
**Description on Tin:** McClelland's rich, fragrant blend of Special Black and the highest grades of Virginias and Carolinas, seasoned with a hint of Oriental and Burley-Virginia Cake Cavendish is topped with a delicate honey-nut aroma that reminds us of Greek Baklava.

**Leaf:** Crumpled black Cavendish ribbon with some short, wide brown bits.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla, raisins, brown sugar. A bit artificial.

**Taste:** Sweet vanilla. Warm, like baking spices. A touch nutty. Sometimes a mild Virginia flavor comes out. A buttery taste. The flavor and aroma does not give up but continues until it is all dottle.

**Nicotine:** Mild, but actually present. Let’s go with a 2 on the scale.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Quite pleasant. It is a bit wet, but even when I was impatient and packed it a tad moister than I like it lit and stayed lit just fine. It will bite you if you let it, but nothing long lasting.
 
**Room Note:** Rich and beautiful. Custardy I guess.

**Thoughts:** I grabbed this out of the box pass (thanks again /u/levins0) under the instructions to make sure to take some aromatic. There were a few bags of this so I thought it was a good choice, not depriving any future aromatic smoker the chance to grab some of the rare stuff in there. I think I got pretty lucky. It is this kind of blend which shows me I do I have love in my heart for the sweet stuff. Well behaved with a flavor that never flags, I can see if I had grabbed this earlier in my career I might have stayed in the dessert aisle quite a bit longer instead of delving straight into Virginias and English. I wouldn’t say this is the kind of blend that will convert the non-aromatic smoker, but for those that enjoy a heavily cased classic Cavendish blend, you won’t regret it.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Captain Black Royal, Strauss Sleepy Hollow, Sutliff Taste of Autumn.
 
**Summary:** A pleasant, easy smoking vanilla and butter Cavendish blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**++

Rating system (interpreted through the Major League Baseball Rule Book):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Stealing 1st base on a dropped 3rd strike)

(++++) Great (The now outmoded contested runner-catcher slugfest rules)

(+++) Very good (The ground rule triple)

(++) Good (All fielders except the catcher are positioned within fair territory)

(+) I think like it (No spitballs)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Ground Rule Double)

(-) I think I dislike this (Having to pitch in an intentional walk)

(--)This is not for me (You can’t steal 1st base from 2nd)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Infinite time outs called by the batter)

(----)This is suffering (What counts as a balk anyway?)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (The designated hitter)

aithosrds: That sounds interesting, I'm also a cigar smoking and I'm starting to investigate the world of pipes myself.  I picked up a cheap MM cob and some Carter Hall tobacco since I've seen that mentioned a lot as a good one to smoke in a fresh pipe, but I haven't really had time to sit down and smoke except a brief bit this evening before dinner.  It's good to see a fellow botl around here though!
--
antiwittgenstein: Carter Hall is just plain good. I do enjoy a cigar - I have about one every week - but I am firmly a pipe smoker first now. It is just what I crave - the fusiness of it, the depth and breadth of the flavors. Try out an English next if you can get your hands on one - that really shows the difference between what a pipe blend and a cigar really can be.
--
aithosrds: I get where you're coming from, but I guess I view cigars the same way you view pipe tobacco.  I pick up different size cigars and each one needs to be smoked differently, some (like lanceros) need to be babied and others can be power-smoked.  I've learned the difference between a one-dimensional cigar and a complex cigar with transitions and I know what to pick out depending on my mood.  

I'm brand new to pipe tobacco, but thus far the Carter Hall wasn't bad (I enjoyed it) but it was very one dimensional to me and I mostly avoid mild cigars with little complexity these days.  I'll look into an English, I saved a post from yesterday where someone recommended me a bunch of things.  When I've got some free time I'm planning to place an order and maybe get a nicer pipe as well.

antiwittgenstein: That is my de facto team of choice too, ever since I visited Wrigley Field. Let's hope the analysts are right and this is finally the year.

====================================
3CATTS: Sounds great. Do soupy aros keep long at all? I kind of doubt they would age or anything, but will they keep thier flavor?
--
antiwittgenstein: Jarred up they are fine to keep, but no they don't really age. I have heard reports the topping-casing breaks down after 3-5 years, but I haven't been around long enough to see that happen. If they dry out though, they are dunzo.
--
3CATTS: Ah, that's nice to know. I thinned out my aros. Maybe it's time to pick a few up. This one sounds good.

====================================
mtn_mojo: Love your reviews! Fun to read one about a cased cavendish, they get too much scorn despite having a solid place in my smoking rotation!
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I am really a non-aro guy, but I like to give a little love to the aromatics every so often, as the diet must have variety even if it is purely for varity's sake. I like them, especially as the weather warms up, but finding one that works for me - tastes good without being soupy, boring, or tongue eviscerating - is a matter of luck. 

What are your cav's of choice?
--
mtn_mojo: I only have a small handful myself! I don't have much of a sweet tooth with either food, drink or smoke -- but when I do have a hankering for a little smoky dessert, I'll reach for either Shortcut to Mushrooms (not strictly a cav, it's got Latakia and I think some VAs in there as well -- kind of amazing), Trout Stream or Hobbit's Weed.
