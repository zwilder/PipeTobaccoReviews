Tobacco Review: H&H 10 to Midnight
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 81

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home Ten to Midnight
 
**Description on Tin:** Ten to Midnight is a dark, full Balkan-style tobacco containing bright and matured Carolina and Virginias, a healthy mixture of Turkish and Orientals, and plenty of flavorful, fragrant Latakia. A superb late-evening smoke that can stand up to a sturdy single-malt scotch, small-batch bourbon or hearty port.

**Leaf:** Broken Kake, lots of mottled brown short flake and a few larger dense bricks
 
**Tin Aroma:** Smokey, smoky, smokey.

**Taste:** Smoke, like a clear wood smoke. Oaky it is in nature, like a bit of oak char you would taste in a bourbon. Burley nuttiness. The flavors are simple, but well integrated and extremely pronounced. This continues pleasantly for about a third of a bowl, then bam, juicy oranges out of nowhere. Fresh and tangy, with quite a bit of spice coming with it. The oak and burley disappear, but there still a touch of smoke there. It is like smoking a smoky old fashioned. As you hit the bottom third the citrus and vinegar recede a bit, and the nuttiness and oak returns, the two different phases of the smoke mingling together as one. It is the kind of tobacco Hegel would approve of. Stays in that balance of sweet and tangy, oaky and smoky, till you let it go out.

**Nicotine:** 3-4

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Not good. It goes out on me all the time, at least until you really get it going, which might take half the bowl. I never fully rub out the big chunks though, which I will try to do in the future
 
**Room Note:** Smoky

**Thoughts:** This is now my favorite English blend. It is not the *best* English I have had – that is harder to name, but this is perfectly oriented to what I want this kind of blend to be – and something I was surprised to taste. P&C, in the above description I just got around to reading right now, thinks this is a good compliment to a glass of whisky. I cannot recommend that, as this tastes too much like a good whisky itself to want accompaniment, and the two would most likely fight, with the tobacco most likely being the victor.

Let’s talk phase one, smoke and oak – this part of the blend reminds me of Dicken’s London, smoky, dark and dank; oak paneled parlors stuffy with logs burning in the fire. Phase two is a mouthful of Christmas oranges – and together they make this the perfect Christmas blend. If I weren’t going to be with my fairly tobacco adverse family for the holidays, this is exactly what I would smoke the night of the 24th. As it is, this is likely my last bowl before the New Year, so I guess this is my de facto Christmas celebration smoke.

**Similar Tobaccos:** C&D Mountain Camp – This is a similar stripped down English, but more of the smoke and pine taste.

H&H Cerberus – This seems to be a further extension of 10 to Midnight, with a much more complex blend. And might actually be that *best* I have tried yet I refused to guess earlier.

Anniversary Kake – This is, as many of you know, not an English blend, but it has that same bright orange and spice flavor, so similar to what is in 10 to Midnight that I suspect Anniversary Kake is literally in 10 to Midnight, or at least sources the same leaf. 
 
**Summary:** A smoke’n’oak, and Christmas oranges English Blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2.5 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight, and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
Dadgy: Great review. I love this stuff, but for me it has to be rubbed out fully, and dry to the point of crispy.

====================================
misterzipp0: I tend to be apprehensive of Latakia heavy blends because of it's overbearing nature. To me it was like when you have a double IPAA and you don't really like hops, it's all you can taste. Eventually with beer your tastes change and you come to crave it but I haven't turned that corner with Latakia, yet.

Do you find that the Latakia in this blend is really more woodsy than the typical overbearing rubber that I get on a lot of blends?
--
antiwittgenstein: I don't get the 'rubber' but I am one of those unfortunate individuals that get a lavender taste with lat heavy blends, so I also avoid the typical lat bombs - but 10 to Midnight has zero lavender. I can't really speak to the rubber however.
--
misterzipp0: Might give it a shot then. Balkan Sasieni is about as Lat heavy as I like.

====================================
SupraMario: Another great review! I love reading these.

====================================
gestalt162: I get an orange note out of MM965. Similar to this?
--
antiwittgenstein: Mmm, I've not really gotten the orange out of 965, but I haven't smoked it in quite awhile. It is a solidly Virginia style citrus flavor.
