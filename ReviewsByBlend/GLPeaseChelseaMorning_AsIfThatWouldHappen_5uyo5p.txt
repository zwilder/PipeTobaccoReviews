[REVIEW] G.L.Pease Chelsea Morning (Old London Series)

====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Another blend from my backlog of notes. I will need to order another tin of this stuff. Hasn’t knocked SixPence off its perch but it was a welcome return to my favourite Enlisg/Balkan zone that let me take a little bit of SixPence with it.

BLURB: Sweet red and bright Virginias, fragrant Orientals, a bit of rich Cyprus Latakia, and just a pinch of Perique. The leaf is blended in layers, briefly pressed, then sliced and tumbled into ribbons. Lively and engaging, with a subtle fruitiness, and an elegant, creamy texture, it's a great bowl to accompany the morning cup.

LEAF: A ribbon cut tobacco that seems more like a carefully broken flake than a traditional ribbon cut, can be broken up further if desired but I smoked it as is. Mottled and speckled gold through brow, with some nice dark Latakia scattered throughout.

TIN AROMA: Dark fruits, tangy and a little sweet, smells very fresh and vibrant for a blend with latakia, it is more a condiment than some of the heavier Lat blends out there, a sweet smokiness but nothing too campfire like. The perique pepper note is noticeable on top.

TASTE: As I have come to expect from blends of this calibre, it tastes much like it smells. The Va’s are at the front with the Orientals, fresh and grassy but still tangy and spicy. Apart from getting a good hit with the first light of the bowl, the Latakia largely lingers in the background proving good depth and body with a sweet, slightly woodsy smokiness that helps balance out the oriental tanginess that is present the whole way. The perique for me was on and off throughout the bowl, and as usual become more pronounced as you got further towards the bottom, with a perfect level of peppery spice to top everything off and tie it all together. Consistently creamy and complex, playing back and forth between the components the whole way with no single leaf overpowering the other. Extremely well balanced. This is an extremely satisfying, creamy, smokey blend that stays interesting the whole way without getting confusing or losing its way. The nicotine seems to creep up with the Perique as well and can be a bit surprising if you don’t look out. This really rewards a long smoke from a large bowl, slowly sipped and retrohaled.

SMOKEABILITY: As is tradition with Pease blends, tin moisture was perfect for me, cut was great. Lit up straight away and stayed lit very well, burnt down to a great ash with noting to spare. Burns cool and consistent the whole way and won’t be upset if you get a bit excited puffing away a bit aggressively, although it tastes better if you don’t.

SUMMARY: As with all other Pease blends I have smoked I cannot fault this. It’s like perfect English and a perfect VaPer rolled into one. Smokes like a dream, tastes even better. It’s like a more amazing version of EMP which is similar but not as complex, if you like that, this is worth a look. I usually gravitate towards more lat heavy blends, but this was a very welcome departure and shows how Latakia can, and should often be, just one of the players in a smoke and not the star. Very close to a perfect smoke for me.

SCORE – 5/5

====================================
JakeJones: Which are your favorites in the old London series? 
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: So far Sixpence would have to be my favorite. I have a tin of Gaslight with close to three years age on it I need to smoke and I have a suspicion that may be the new king.

The first time I had both EMP and Chelsea Morning, it was in a back-to-back comparison that left me wondering why anyone would bother with EMP, if Chelsea Morning were available.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: It definitely leaves EMP feeling wanting. I am a fan of EMP usually too but you're right.
