[Review] The Country Squire - Flambeau (Complex Cherry) - or - In Defense of Aromatics
By: AdamantFinn

Aromatic blends are, without doubt, the red-headed stepchild of pipe tobaccos. They are mostly thought of as either a beginner’s smoke or a poor quality tobacco disguised with sweet flavorings and moisturizers. While both are true there is still a third category of aromatics that are made up of quality tobaccos and carefully chosen flavorings. It is this third category that I’m going to focus on and hopefully make a positive, persuasive argument in their favor.

Maybe because it is November right now that I am specifically thinking of Thanksgiving here in the States. The smell of turkey and stuffing coming from the kitchen competing with the scent of crisp air and dried leaves from the opened front door. Wool sweaters being even more scratchy in the living room than they are outside.

I never really liked Thanksgiving. To be honest I kind of hated having to share my ice cream with my great aunt and play along with the grown-ups as they “kidded” with me and my sister and cousins. What I loved, though, was that it was going to start snowing any second, Santa was going to bring toys and we weren’t going to have to go to school! It was all going to start just as soon as the meal was over and we left Grandma and Grandpa’s. So, can’t we leave now, pleeeeeeaaase?!

Well of course we couldn’t, the grown-ups were all drunk on Tryptophan and some regrettable flight of wine and beer and eggnog and scotch. We were all hopped up on sugar ourselves, racing into the less familiar areas of the house. The stuffy bedroom with a “Color” TV and a remote that didn’t click, it clunked. The halls lined with pictures of us all. Past the cellar door (VERY fast) and with a look over our shoulders. Into Grandpa’s den where he sat grumpy and retreated,  puffing on his pipe and that sweet cherry and leather smell that filled the whole room. He had had enough of listening to his “expert” sons-in-law bullshit about this and that and couldn’t wait for the whole lot to go home. But he was never grumpy with the kids, he was always happy to see us. He’d smile and put down the pipe and pick us up onto his lap and he’d tell the over-populated armchair a story or ask us forgettable but important questions (important because he cared what WE had to say).

It is this memory that draws me to pipe smoking, to revisit that experience and to be closer to my grandfather. 

**The Blender:** The Country Squire. Jim & Gwen Reeves established The Country Squire in 1970 in Jackson, Mississippi. Jim passed in 1981 and in 2012 Gwen passed the torch to Jon David Cole who maintains the Country Squire’s legacy and dedication to tradition.

**The Blend:** Flambeau (Complex Cherry)

**The Tin:** No tin. Flambeau is a custom blend only available at The Country Squire in Jackson, MS or via their website (thecountrysquireonline.com). It comes in a very stylish Ziplock bag.

**The Tobacco:** Black Cavendish, Oriental/Turkish, Virginia. The charcoal black Cavendish ribbon is freckled with caramel-brown Oriental and reddish Virginias. The moisture level is just shy of proper for jarring and you may want to let it breathe for a bit before storing or smoking.

**Upon Opening:** Dark vanilla sets the stage for a soda-fountain cherry and a mild spice shines through the flavoring like rays of light through a [cucoloris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucoloris). It is neither heavy nor perfumey.

**The Smoke:** The tobacco packs easily and takes a match well but will require some attention through the bowl. This is a deep, full and rich smoke. Very little of the cherry comes through in the taste but it is noticeable in the room. There is no trace of the vanilla. The quality Virginias are wonderfully grassy while the spicy Oriental doesn’t give them the freedom to get too sweet. The Cavendish is almost as full as a Burley and keeps the Virginia in harmonious check so the smoke remains cool. As with most aromatics, there is very little nicotine.

**Conclusion:** Flambeau is a terrific smoke and a great example of how good an aromatic can be; a blend of excellent tobaccos with just the right amount of flavoring. One caveat: while the tobacco is superior, the casing is slightly artificial, falling somewhere closer to a Jolly Rancher than to a Smith Brothers cough drop. Don’t let that keep you from trying Country Squire’s – Flambeau. See for yourself and you will be rewarded with a very satisfying smoke. My grandfather smoked an aromatic because he liked it and he would rather be happy and spend time with his grandchildren than to worry about the “experts” in the dining room.

**Reviewers note:** Like Ahab, my TAD compels me to pursue the "dumb brute" and to dance away at the ends of /u/antiwittgenstein strings
====================================
ryanwhodat: I like aros, but only occasionally. About once a month is probably enough for me. So that, coupled with the fact that they don't age well, is why i never buy them. At the end of the day, smoke what you like, and like what you smoke.

====================================
pylorns: I smoke lots of aros, virginias, and english blends, plenty of really good aro blends that are great so I'll always defend them.  Good on ya.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Excellent review, in depth and meandering and courageous. Aromatics are certainly challenging, frequently disappointing, and often leaves my mouth sore the next day. So like dating. But just like dating, you wait long enough and you jump back in.

AdamantFinn: I *knew* it looked weird, damn, it kept catching my eye but I couldn't put my finger on why. My apologies to everyone from both Michigan and Mississippi.
