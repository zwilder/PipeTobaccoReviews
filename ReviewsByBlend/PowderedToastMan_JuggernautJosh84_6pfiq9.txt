Powdered Toast Man - Review

Morning!  Yesterday I received the sample of Powdered Toast Man /u/coldsolderjoint and /u/linearone have put together. I'm not great at picking out flavors and notes yet, but I wanted to pass along what I thought.

Tin(bag) Aroma - Sweet, smelled amazing.  I got hints of vanilla and honey, and just a bit of spice on the tail.

Taste - Thick, buttery smoke, with just bits of cinnamon at the end. 

Room Note -Good. I was outside, but the screen door was open.  When I went in, I could smell it in our back room.

Overall it was a great smoke.  From what I've gathered in my short time with pipes, I like aromatics.  This wasn't overly sweet or goopey though.  I did let it dry a bit, about 1/2 hour.  I had no problems with keeping it lit, a few touch ups, and one full relight was all.  Prince Albert was a great choice in this I believe.  I love that the burley shined through, with just hints of cinnamon.

Thank you both for doing this.  Really cool idea.  Look forward to trying other things you guys may be working on.

NegativeOffset: Can't wait to try it. The bag aroma is off the charts.

atj0308: I noticed you mentioned a "touch-up" light. Is this where you notice that only a portion of the bowl seems to be burning and give the other part a little flame? 

I haven't tried this, but have noticed that sometimes I really only see smoke coming from one part of the bowl.

JuggernautJosh84: I'm no expert by any means so take this with a grain of salt. I don't know if this is the correct thing to do or not.  After lighting and smoking for a bit I noticed about 1/4 of the bowl wasn't lit well.  I just kissed it with the flame with very small puffs to get it going.  I've had better luck with this method than puffing hard on the pipe to get everything going again.
