{Review} C&D Cellar Series: Bourbon Bleu

**Blend Name:**Bourbon Bleu

**Description on Tin:** Perhaps the most well-known street in the French Quarter, the oldest district in New Orleans, this Cellar Series blend takes its name from the colorful Bourbon street, whose distinct blue shutters have lined the rue for years . In this equally memorable blend, bright and red Virginias are mixed with just the right amount of dark-fired Kentucky and long-cut Perique, then married together with bourbon before being press to form an old-fashioned crumble cake. 

**Leaf:** A mostly blonde crumble cake flecked with dark spots

**Tin Aroma:** Sweet bourbon, sweet hay, and a whiff of a wood burning stove gone cold. The sweetness isn't cloying, and there's fruity backdrop to the whole thing. Very inviting. Also I should note, this is at the very bottom of my tin.  

**Taste:** Charring light brings sweet, yet earthy Virginias laced with a strong blast of pepper. The dark-fired shows here, too, with a subtler, sweeter smokiness reminiscent of smouldering hardwoods as opposed to the pine and tang of Lataklia. 

True light gets things going again much more softly. Despite the sweet tin note, the smoke is pleasantly dry and almost tannic. THe VAs are all about baking bread flavors, yeasty sweet and sour, bringing to mind freshly floured boards and a warm oven. The dark-fired adds to the image with warm, yet subtle smokey flavors. The perique is very mild, adding just a touch of body and a tickle of spice to the mix, expressing itself as a very mild pepper impression. There's a fruitiness to this blend underlying the other flavors, but I can't tell where it's coming from. It's not quite perique, and the perique feels very light. My best guess is some mysterious interplay of the dark-fired and VA. 

A relight a quarter of the way in brings the dark-fired back up to the front again, the sweet bright VA giving way to the more bitter taste of smoked burley. As I settle back into my rhythm, the VAs step back to the forefront. It's difficult to differentiate each component. I know, in my mind, where the flavors are coming from, which ingredient adds which taste, but in the actual experience, they blend together. This isn't a dark-fired blend like Old Dark Fired, it's a nearly straight VA, spiced and scented with condiments to provide a harmonious smoke. The bourbon topping is lost behind the tobacco profile, probably adding to that unity, and perhaps the source of those vague fruity notes that still crop up here and there. 

Typically, a bright VA forward blend like this gets sweeter as time goes by. This blend is the opposite. As I pass the midway point in the bowl, the components wind more tightly together. The impression is a much fuller smoke than what I started with. Hay and leaves dominate with layers of heavy wood flavors. Cedar and oak weave back and forth, at sometimes presenting a tangy green note like a freshly felled tree, and at other times reminding me of the mounting piles of saw dust under my father's table saw as a kid. 

As the bowl starts to wind up, the typical C&D sour earthiness finally comes out into the mix. The flavors are dry, tangy, and complex. Wood and leaves still lead the mix. If I didn't know better, I'd have suspected there was some white burley hiding in here, but there's not. The virginias keep the blend sweet enough, contrasting with and balancing the dry, peppery notes on the back of the palate. The retrohale is also delicately spicy. What little perique there is has expressed itself well, adding just the right touch of body to the smoke a little dark, fruity bass noted in the background. As the smoke hits the dottle, it stays smooth, rich, and respectably full-bodied without getting muddy or harsh.

**Smokability:** Once crumbled and packed, this blend couldn't burn more easily. Some of the more compressed bits made it into the pipe, but still burned neatly away. An important note for those of you who haven't played with a crumble cake yet. Don't slice them with a knife like you would a plug. This shreds the ribbon and turns it into tiny fishfood bits. Just tear a chunk off and crumble it to your liking. If you try to slice flakes, the bits will be incredibly small and not allow for a good draw or burn. I can feel the nicotine on this one, but that's after an EX sized bowl. 

**Mustache Note:** Remarkably light, just the faintest whiff of warm, Virginia scents, dry leaves and a little sweet.

**Thoughts:** I was really disappointed by this one when I first popped the tin. The initial smoke tasted like flat cardboard at first. The next day I tried again and found it much improved. Now with a few weeks open, it's really developed nicely. This smoke is all about the bright Virginia. The other components are used as spices more than outright notes. You can certainly taste the dark-fired and the Perique throughout the bowl, but they never take center stage. Instead they just add body, strength, and emphasis to what would be good, but rather boring Virginias on their own. This blend is a little lighter than a lot of what I smoke, but the strength of the flavors and the creamy body make it satisfying nonetheless. If this kind of blend is the shape of things to come for C&D, I can see myself falling in love with their blends all over again. Smoked in my Punto Oro Sandblasted 111 EX

**Recommend to:** This blend smokes like a creamy cup of coffee drinks. It's unsweetened, but never bitter. It's a solid medium body, neither weak nor especially powerful. Beginners will find this approachable, but veterans will find a lot going on they might not have noticed without their experience. If you like bright VAs and enjoy creamy smokes, you really need to pick up a tin. Don't let the bourbon top note fool you. The bourbon is a background flavor for the first few minutes of the bowl and fades to the background. There's nothing aromatic about this smoke at all. 

**Summary:** Creamy, smooth, and very rich in flavor. This blend feels like it was built to emphasize good bright VAs and does it well. There's just enough other stuff in there to keep the smoke interesting while the VAs lead the show. 

**My Background:** I've been regularly smoking pipes for almost three years now, and dabbled before. I'm a former cigarette smoker, with an appreciation for hookahs, snus, and the occasional cigar. I love strong, heavy blends like Brown Irish Twist and Old Joe Krantz. I find I'm liking Latakia blends more and more, and the only aromatics I smoke with any regularity are Lakelands. If you're brand new to tobacco or sensitive to nicotine, I'm a terrible person to take advice from as I practically run on equal parts caffeine and nicotine. Also, fair disclosure, I recently started working for the distributor for C&D and Savinelli pipes along side /u/turnerj5. This blurb subject to change as I find my tastes are shifting yet again. Perhaps more on that in a seperate post sometime. 
====================================
ijustreadidontpost: Fantastic write-up.  Thanks for sharing.  We have similar tastes, though your palate is much more advanced than mine.  I often reach for something with big flavors and big nicotine content.  Told my wife I'd quit caffeine with her while she was pregnant, though.  Thank god for Lady N.

Chuzordie: Your a braver man than I,  my dear beloved coffee comes before my wife.  She knows it and understands her place in this love triangle.  She was very opposed to coffee when we first married and loved the smell but would not drink of the water of life.  Slowly I have taught her the err of her ways and she now shares a pot with me every morning,  while smoking her navy flake or she might change it up and drown the room with the chocolate mint aromatic "Thin Mint" blend she made.

Chuzordie: While I prefer Burley blends this make a very fine advert for the blend.

hedonaut: I smoke more burleys than anything else, myself. This one caught me off guard.

antiwittgenstein: Nice, detailed thoughtful write up, as usual.

I got a tin of this in the poetry contest - that recommended aging of 15 years was fairly painful to read. I reckon I will have to crack it open, jar it, and smoke some now. Who knows if any of this will be legal in 15 years...
--
hedonaut: Do it. I'm going to end up buying the big cans if ever they are released. It's good to smoke now.
