GL Pease ~~Sixpence + Vanilla~~ Virginia Cream

**Description on tin:** Oh, you know, the usual pretentious GLP horseshit that we superfans have come to know and love! 

> Distinctively delicious! We season fine red and golden flue-cured Virginia tobaccos with rare condimental leaf, enhancing the result with a subtle vanilla/bourbon topping that is never overbearing. Rare for a blend of its genre, Virginia Cream delivers on its aromatic promise from first puff to the bottom of the bowl, while leaving the pipe clean and free of phantom flavors. An all-American blend ideal for Virginia fanciers craving something a little sweeter.

Well... That really wasn't all that pretentious or prosy. WTF, Master Pease? I didn't feel at all as if I were walking into a dark, smoky room in anticipation of a vampire attack or anything.

**Leaf:** A mostly standard ribbon cut of bright Virginia, Perique, Black Cavendish, and a bit of Kentucky. "Mostly," as the blend contains a few crumpled leaves. It's fairly moist out of the tin, but dries decently within 10-15 minutes here at an altitude of 5.5k ft. 

**Tin note:** Dried fruit, a little grass, a little tangy, as typical of perique-light VaPers, but of course with some vanilla tossed in. The topping isn't heavy, but it's certainly noticeable as a vanilla cream soda. When I first cracked the tin, I was hoping the actual flavor wouldn't be as strong as it presents itself in the tin. I don't get much of a hint of the Kentucky. I'm smelling it side by side with Sixpence right now, as they have similar makeups. VA Cream comes across as a little lighter than Sixpence. The topping is much more distinct in comparison.

**Taste:** On the first light, I get a blast of both tangy and bready Virginias, a bit of sting from the perique, and the topping steps in to make for an impression of cream soda mixed with Sprite. That all calms down after a few puffs, but it was a hell of a first impression. The vanilla is really at the forefront there for a few seconds, but settles into a harmony with the Virginias. The bright VA twang falls off a bit as well, and find myself enjoying a fairly mellow, lightly flavored VaPer. The vanilla is a little more on the "there" side of "barely there." It's easy to forget about the flavor and enjoy the tobacco, or take a puff and pick out the components and find the vanilla lingering on the edge of smoke. The bourbon is hard to find, appearing here and disappearing there. When I *can* find it, the whole of it briefly reminds me of the bread pudding with bourbon sauce my dad used to make. It's fleeting, but those moments make for a tastier than normal few puffs. And, speaking of barely there, the Kentucky is always around, giving bass and body, though I don't get much of its typical smoky taste. 

In the right pipe (more on this below), the flavors stay pretty consistent through the bowl, though there is a notable deepening at about the halfway mark. 

**Smokeability:** On the plus side, it burns easily enough after some drying time, and I have yet to pick up a ghost from it. On the downside... this stuff has been finicky about the pipe I put it in. A couple of my nicer smokers (one bent bulldog and a bent apple morta) had it going a little acrid and unenjoyable with 1/3 of the bowl left. A bent billiard with a wide bowl made for a great smoke almost top to bottom, where it got a bit foul on the last 1/4 or 1/5. A straight poker with a mid-sized bowl yielded the best, most consistent smoke.

**TL;DR:** Sixpence + Vanilla, perhaps a little brighter. The topping isn't as thick in the smoke as it is in the tin. Be ready to spend some time figuring out which pipe to put it in.

**Rating:** 7/10

And, of course, much thanks to /u/hedonaut for bending time and space to his will in order to get a tin of this stuff out to me.
====================================
soymilkisgood: Nice review. I hope to be trying some of this stuff soon. I'm very wary of aromatics, even those that people say are very good, as I've found I hate all of them. Hopefully I'll be able to sample it at the next pipe show in Sin City.

chewsyourownadv: Good luck! Personally, I'm thinking if you can deal with the boozy toppings on some of his other blends (especially the heavy ones like Sextant and Navigator), this won't be bad.

Ciceronian: Excellent review, captured so much of my thoughts on the blend that I'm not skilled enough to put in words.

Weirdly, I've had the same exact experience with pipe finickiness, AND it's also smoked best in a mid-sized straight poker for me as well... Not sure what that's about.

====================================
SMIDSY: Tried some myself thanks to your sound advice. Worth the buy. In my tin, I was pretty struck by how strong the bourbon smelled and tasted. Perhaps there is some variation from tin to tin?
--
chewsyourownadv: Maybe. I tend to think the differences are more often due to the way we interpret scents, than to manufacturing inconsistencies. At least, when it comes to a decent quality manufacturer like C&D, which does Pease's blends.

antiwittgenstein: Solid review - you beat me to it, but my own will be coming soon. I still need a few bowls more, but my experience has been slightly different from your own. Though I have seen the variation from pipe to pipe.

chewsyourownadv: Cool, I'm looking forward to your thoughts.
