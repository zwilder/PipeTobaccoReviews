Powdered Toast Man - Thanks and Mini-Review

When the initial post came out offering samples for testing and review I quickly asked to be included. I love cinnamon flavors, but being pretty new to pipe smoking, I hadn't thought to seek out any cinnamon-y blends. Right off the bat I was interested. 

When I received the packet I was impressed with the packaging and description card. The presentation really showed that the project was fun for /u/linearone and /u/coldsolderjoint. It made the experience as a recipient a lot cooler too.  

As far as a review - well, it was a great smoke. I agree with much of what has been said, especially the notes that were provided. The early cinnamon that levels off and burns down to the hearty burley. 

Being a new pipe smoker I feel I lack the palate and experience to pick up the subtleties and nuances, but I will say this: It had the flavors without that mouth feel of a lot of aros. For example, something like Captain Black or to a lesser extent lane 1Q leaves a cloudly film feel to my mouth - I assume it has something to do with the casing or topping. PTM has much less of that typical aro mouth feel, probably cut by the PA and Perique. 

I enjoyed it enough that I ordered enough component parts to make a batch. That should be some indication of how much I liked it. I plan to make and taste my own batch and smoke the remaining bowl from the sample and compare - just to show whether lay blender can reproduce from the ratios provided. I may also compare to another cinnamon-centric blend I ordered. 

Cool project, guys. Thanks again.
