Tobacco Review : Mac Baren's Highland Blend
By: DrScience11
---
Received a sample in the IPSD goodie bag from pipes and cigars.

**Blend Name**: Highland Blend

**Description on Tin**:Fully matured Virginias, Ready Rubbed Burleys, Latakia and a touch of Fire-cured Cavendish is the recipe. We added one of the worlds finest 30-year old Scotch whiskies, Glenfarclas. The natural flavours from the tobacco and the delightful taste of the Scotch marry perfectly, so when smoked you experience the mellow taste and subtle smoky note of the tobaccos combined with the overtone of a fine scotch.

**Looks**: Dark golden strips.  Looks like a flake that has been semi-rubbed out, yielding long, thick rope like strands.  Has some darker flecks throughout. Feels dry, but not brittle.

**Smells**: Campfire smoke and maple-y sweetness.  The scotch gives a very earthy, rich sweetness to the aroma.

**Taste**: Fairly complex.  Fruity notes from the Virginias are rounded out on by the burleys, which add their distinctive taste.  The latakia is noticeable, but takes a back seat here.  Though if you don't like latakia, and therefore have a super sense for it, it plays a prominent enough role that you definitely won't like this blend.  The scotch flavorings are laced throughout, giving a darker sweetness to contrast the brightness of the virginas. 

**Compare to** : Um....this is farily unique. I'm not a huge aromatic guy (see background), so I haven't had anything like this.  I actually find this similar to black cavendish blends, with some latakia mixed in.

**Summary**: Not great, not bad.  It's a decent aromatic, and is certainly unique.  The scotch and the Latakia give it a rich sweetness which is rare compared to the syrup flavorings of aromatics or the fruitiness of Virginias. It has a bit of a astrigent bite to it, which is probably attributed to the latakia.  The latakia role is promient, and serves as the underlying back bone, with the scotch and Virginias layering on top of it. That being said, latakia haters really should stay away.  The casual english smoker might find this fusion of sweet and smokey interesting though.

**Rating : 3/5**

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak and Dunhill's nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of english blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q. I've been piping for almost 6 months, and smoke frequently.
