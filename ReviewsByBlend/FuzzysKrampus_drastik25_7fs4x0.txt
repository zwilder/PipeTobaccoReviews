Tobacco Review: Krampus by /u/fuzzy_totemz

This happens to be my first post on /r/pipetobacco, as well as my first ever tobacco review. My disclaimer is that I am very new to the hobby (started about 3 weeks ago) so I won't be able to go as in-depth as others might be able to, however I wanted to put a review out there as I haven't seen one posted yet. 

**Krampus**    
From Wikipedia: "In folklore, Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as "half-goat, half-demon", who, during the Christmas season, punishes children who have misbehaved, in contrast with Saint Nicholas, who rewards the well-behaved with gifts."    

**In the bag -** The aroma from the bag is wonderful, and perfect for the holidays. Upon opening it smells like cookies as well as creamy vanilla. Despite the fact it smells aromatic, the flakes were only a little bit moist, but not so much so I couldn't pack right away. I've had 3 bowls now (after receiving it yesterday), and it's smoked well with and without a few minutes of drying time. The blend consists of small flakes with a few longer ribbons, very easy to pack in the pipe.

**Smoking -** It took me a few puffs to get a proper charring light/tamper, and then a couple more and it lit right up. As I'm still inexperienced, I normally have to relight several times through a bowl, but this smoked easily and I've only had to relight a couple times at the end. I've had no problems burning it all the way down to the bottom of the bowl in my MM Mark Twain, and there were only a few flakes left in my Nording, though I believe that's due more to the pipe's design than the tobacco itself. It's taken me about 45 minutes per bowl, which is perfect for me. It produces more smoke than other tobaccos I've tried, which I've listed below, which has made it great for learning to blow smoke rings if that's your thing :)

**Flavor and Aroma -** Due to my inexperience I can't sit here and pick out what all the individual flavors are, but I can say that I enjoyed swirling every single puff around before reluctantly exhaling the smoke. It starts off with a nice smooth flavor, certainly appropriate for Christmas, but starting around halfway through the bowl it lives up to its namesake and gains a good kick of spice, punishing you for thinking it might be just another sweet Christmas blend. It also has a notable nicotine hit compared to the other tobaccos I've had. Fortunately, the aroma smells just as good as the leaf in the bag so it has approval from my wife! The taste also lingers for a good while after the smoke (in a good way) which only increases my desire to smoke it again.

**Thoughts -** This is a great blend, and while I may not be able to compare it to the myriad of other blends out there, I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a holiday blend. Up until yesterday, my only experience with pipe tobacco was a couple OTC pouches (plain tobacco and a vanilla aromatic), McClelland 5100 Red Cake, Frog Morton, and Frog Morton's Cellar. I've got plenty of new blends I look forward to trying, but for now Krampus is hands down my favorite of the bunch. My 2oz baggy will be gone in no time!

antiwittgenstein: Howdy and welcome to both the hobby and the sub. Thanks for posting up a nice review of a blend many of us are curious about. It is fantastic you just started and took the plunge to share your thoughts with us immediately. Come back and share your thoughts on anything or everything you smoke.

Fuzzy_Totemz: Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I kept telling people that Krampus was the anti-holiday blend, had a mean whip, etc; but it helps when someone comes out and mentions the spice and nic hit!  
  
Glad you enjoyed it!

cmdr_andrew_dermott: Tried a bowl of this after Thanksgiving dinner. Great smell; odd flavour. Not even sure how I would describe the flavour.

I found it pretty harsh. 

Paging u/Fuzzy_Totemz, since the tag in the original post, I think, won't work properly.

Fuzzy_Totemz: Krampus has a mean whip!  
  
It's a spicy blend for sure. The more I smoked it the more I liked it. Kind of like Yenidje (white knight, balkan sobranie) where the first time I smoked it, the incense kicked my ass.  It has a nic hit as well.  
  
That's why the Krampen Mal is the Yin to the Yang. Mal is easy going happy go lucky comfy fruity goodness safe to smoke before bed even.  It also makes a good "cool down" smoke after Krampus.  
  
Krampus was meant to address people hating the fact that Holiday blends are too gentle.  
  
Not everyone will like it, but those who do will _really_ like it.

java02: These descriptions are amazing.

madnatxinho: Ordered a sample of each last week, can't wait!

cmdr_andrew_dermott: It was definitely cool to finally try deer tongue. I'm looking forward to smoking the second bowl out of that sample; hopefully with a bit more time to pay attention to the taste, instead of running off to a second Thanksgiving dinner.

Felt the nic hit after the first half-bowl. Just what I needed to survive the second round of family, honestly.
--
drastik25: It definitely got more and more harsh as I smoked through the bowl, but I liked it! Maybe for the same reason I like trying new hot sauces and spices whenever I get the chance.
