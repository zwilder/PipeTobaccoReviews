Review: C&D Exclusive

Any amount less of Perique is simply a tease.  I love Perique and this blend proves that to myself.  Mostly a nice clean Virginia flavor, but that Perique is made clear the longer the smoke is held in the mouth and especially on the retrohale. With a proper cadence, the blend stays will lit. With a larger draw, you can really taste that Perique and with no tongue bite. Obvious nicotine content also. I don't get much from the Cavendish. My palate is not yet developed enough to pick up the nuances that may be present, but the hay flavor of the Virginias are clear and the spice of the Perique even more so. I enjoyed this out of an MM legend with a cup of medium roast coffee. If you can handle the amount of nicotine, I could see this as an all day smoke.
====================================
None: I like Exclusive, I've even smoked pure Perique.

None: It's not as crazy as it's made out to be, I think Perique lovers should give it a try at least once.

None: It's good to try all component tobaccos to get a pure sense of what your are tasting if you get a chance. That way when you taste something in a blend you like you're more likely to know what it is, McClelland makes great blending tobaccos IMO.

first-capri: I think you would have to have tried it in on it's own in order to call yourself a Perique lover.  When I started the pipe hobby, I picked up straight Virginia flake, mixing Perique, and a house English.  And I definitely prefer the VaPer blends.

bonehed: It went something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/9rH0XNB.jpg).

first-capri: Do you keep that pure Perique in your rotation, or have you just smoked it a few times to gather the profile?
--
None: It's not something I due regularly :)

====================================
mugwump867: I got a tin of this in a trade a few years back but still haven't opened it.  Sounds like a good one.

first-capri: It is like a really good Virginia, with an added peppery flavor, and a nicotine hit similar to a Burley.  I really enjoy it, almost too much.  I would like some more, but I don't want that much nicotine more than once today.  If you are unfamiliar with Perique, Exclusive will certainly introduce it to you and it won't take much to decide if there is too much Perique for your liking.  Pop your tin, have a few bowls, and if you don't like it, trade it away.  Or, there is always that cellar trick.  Just jar it and come back to it in 6 months.

mugwump867: I like Haddo's Delight and VA/Pers like Anniversary Kake and Beacon so this should be right up my alley.
--
bonehed: Might try Chenet's Cake if you haven't yet... good amount of Perique in there too.
--
first-capri: I will add that to my list,  thanks for the suggestion.
