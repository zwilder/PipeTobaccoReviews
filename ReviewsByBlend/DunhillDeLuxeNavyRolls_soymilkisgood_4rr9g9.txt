crimblade: **Blend Name:** Dunhill De Luxe Navy Rolls

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** De Luxe Navy Roll is made in Denmark using hand-stripped Virginia tobaccos from Brazil and Africa, married with Perique from Louisiana. This recipe produces an aromatic smoke with natural tobacco flavors and lovely sweet notes.

**Leaf:** Virginia/Perique, Cut into beautiful coins of brown with intermittent flecks of paler leaf. I think it's technically curly cut.

**Tin Aroma:** Upon opening the tin I was greeted by a pleasant fruit aroma with undercurrents of hay. That hasn't changed after jarring, it's a delight to pop it open and breath deeply of the fruit, slightly sour scent with hay still lingering in the background. 

**Taste:** Grass and hay weaving around each other like a late summer day. Definite peppery notes intermingling in the flavor, only really jumping out on the retrohale. Towards the second half of the bowl and beyond I got hints of plum, while the pepper built up continuously throughout that second half. Interestingly enough the spice on the retro decreased in the later bowl. 

**Smokability:**  This benefited from some pretty committed drying, I tried it the first time straight from the tin without drying and it smoked rather well but hot for the entirety of it. I used fold and stuff exclusively and this tobacco responds very nicely with my preferred method of smoking coins.

**Room Note:** Light and pleasant, the clothing scent afterwards left something to be desired but the scent while smoking was a very nice companion to the taste.

**Thoughts:** Escudo Escudo Escudo. That seems to be the powerhouse against which all other VaPers are compared. For good reason since it's a rock solid representation of what a VaPer should be. Wait, I'm not reviewing Escudo, uhm, anyways. This tobacco is often compared to Escudo in reviews I read, many seem to be stuck on having it be an intended match blend. This could very well be the case. The fact that this blend contains no Cavendish not withstanding. From a flavor point I found this blend to be sweeter than Escudo as well as more flavor all around in the smoke itself. Where this blend comes out a little ahead for me is that the flavors feel like a less watered down version of what Escudo presents. Personally I love the presentation of coin tobacco, it's just perfect in every way. Not to mention it lends itself perfectly to fold and stuff. The blend itself is spun well enough that there are no real points in the smoke where one tobacco dominates as it enters a new area of the coin. That's never been a bad thing necessarily, but it does end up providing a very consistent smoke each and every time. Speaking of consistent this tobacco consistently lasted over an hour and was very well behaved once lit, very rarely did I have to relight even when ignoring it for wandering thoughts. Depending on the drying time this tobacco would burn very nicely to the bottom, however every time I smoked it there was some amount of gurgle that would develop, very easily taken care of with a pipe cleaner, but take it for what you will. I enjoyed this blend the most when sitting in the shade of a bright hot afternoon, maybe it was the hay and grass notes, it just seemed to compliment that time of day perfectly.

**Recommend to:** VaPer lovers, especially those who can't get enough Escudo. It's also rather similar to Davidoff Flake Medallions, although like Escudo that one is a much milder flavor

**Summary:** I do enjoy this tobacco. It's a solid VaPer and gives me that flavor profile I'd missed from not having Escudo on hand then a little bit more than that. It's not my favorite VaPer but it's certainly up there in the blends I'll reach for when I'm feeling in the mood for a VaPer, which is rather often lately thanks to the heat. I'm not sure that I'll get another tin when this one runs out. It seems the increased flavor profile comes with an increased price and what this smoke gives me isn't really worth that increased price.

**Drink Pairings:** This went marvelously with a Saison, particularly a farmhouse saison. It also went well with lemonade or limeade which seemed fitting in the sun. I also paired this with milk one evening to see if the rumors were true, it was surprisingly pleasant and really did work great as a palate cleanser.

**Final Rating:** 3.5/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 2 years with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Morton's Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.

antiwittgenstein: Excellent write up! Thanks for posting it up. Have you had McClelland 2015 VaPer Flake or SG St. James yet? Those are the VaPers I now consider to be my comparison blend. Not too hot, not too mild, woody and sweet.
--
crimblade: Thanks! I actually grabbed some St James from the box pass when it came my way. I've only smoked it once and had mixed results which I'm pretty positive had everything to do with not drying it long enough. I certainly look forward to trying it again but that seems to require more planning out the future than I tend to do. If you have any preparation tips on it is sure appreciate them. I'll have to add the 2015 to my wish list, the more VaPers the better in my book.
--
antiwittgenstein: SG flakes are SG flakes, wet and nasty to deal with. I would take out a flake or two, crumble it, and wait a day or so to smoking. It takes some planning, but you really have ~4 days from when you take it out till I noticed any overdrying (in about 40-60% relative humidity range, 70-80 F temps), so you have some time to think about it. It is amazing when it smokes nicely, so godspeed. 
--
crimblade: Thanks! I crumbled some up this morning so at some point this weekend I'll be taking another stab at it.

====================================
PeskyPrussian: I love VaPers and this blend encapsulates everything I love about VaPers.

The tin note is the typical combo of sweet and sour raisin with some brown sugar and a little hit of zingy spice.

I’ve had bad experiences with the “fold and stuff” method for flakes, so for this blend I’ve tried a combination of cube cutting and just good old fashioned smash and rub.  I also gave this a bit of drying time before smoking to help give it a leg up in the burning department.

Now for the taste; I’ve noticed that some vapers need at least a few minutes after the initial light for the Virginia and perique to build up steam and create a combined flavor, but this one was excellent from the very first puff. Overall, this has to be one of the richest tasting blends I’ve had.  Now, Perique is known for being a chameleon leaf, reading anywhere from earthy and salty to fruity and tart depending on the type of leaf it’s paired with and its relative proportion. In this case, the flavor is all about deep, dark, sweet fruit (plums, dates, etc.) with an elusive fermented citric thing that pops up once in a while.  The Virginias (I assume) provide a yeasty, bready flavor which was a constant behind everything else. The flavors build and hold firm to the back of the tongue. A description which is just occurring to me now is tawny port. Yes, a glass of tawny port with a slice of sourdough bread.

The retrohale gives just a bigger hit of the same mix of flavors along with a slow, pleasant building tingle which was surprisingly well behaved considering how much perique is in here.

The aftertaste of the bowl (which is honestly one of my favorite aspects of pipe smoking) continues along the sweet/tart fermented fruity thing with an additional tannic, earthy dryness that reminds me of a wet, loamy campfire.  Perhaps grilled fruit is a good way to put it.

In general this blend burned pretty well for a flake, probably because I was smoking it too fast in my enjoyment.  It did bite me a bit on one occasion.  Again, probably because I was smoking it too fast in my enjoyment.

Comparing this to Escudo, I would say that Escudo is mainly bready with some nice fruit notes while this is mainly fruity with some supporting bread notes. Another tobacco which I find remarkably similar to this is McClelland 2015.  In fact, these two jars are right next to each other in my tobacco drawer and I tend to reach for one or the other if I want this kind of flavor. 

Nicotine wise, this one was formidable for me. I didn’t fall out of my chair, but there were a few occasions when I had to set the pipe down for a few minutes once I felt my brain start to swim a bit.

Summary: What distinguishes this blend is the sheer obviousness of the flavor.  There are many tobaccos (oriental blends, etc) which tease you with subtle complexity, that make you sit and puff and think about what the flavors might be.  This isn’t one of those. I love sweet fruity vapers and this is like a gauntleted fist of dark, sweet, fruity vaper. If this ridiculous hyperbole of a review didn’t tip you off already…yeah…

antiwittgenstein: Well my mouth is watering and I want a glass of port. Well done.

====================================
scriptonic: I like it a lot....how ever its a pricier version of escudo...like it's the same damn exact thing as escudo. 3/4
--
soymilkisgood: Thank you for the extremely detailed review. I learned a lot from  your insight into this blend.
--
scriptonic: Cest bon.
--
givemeyours0ul: I've read this before, that they are exactly the same. I've read several long articles that state they are the same. However, I just opened a tin of each and they smelled completely different. The Dunhill smelled much stronger and tangier. Now, perhaps one of them had say in the store for a couple years? Hard to say.
--
PeskyPrussian: I think McClelland 2015 is extremely similar to this as well and it's significantly cheaper than both.  However, pipe tobacco in general is cheap so I didn't really consider relative price to be enough of a negative to effect its score.

====================================
Hodmimir: I won't write out a huge long comment about this seeing as how the gentleman below me did an outstanding job reviewing the blend, but I figured I'd chime in seeing as I'm a huge fan of roll cut flakes, especially VaPers. I find the deluxe navy rolls to be very good and very full in flavor, but slightly more harsh and tangy than I normally go for in a Virginia flake. The Perique's spice is a huge plus, but the Virginia overpowers it. Its similar to Escudo, so if you're a fan of one I'm sure you will like the other. Personally, as far as roll cuts go, Stokebeys Luxury Bullseye Flake or Davidoff Flake Medallions still have my heart, though I will never turn down a bowl of this stuff. Solid 3 out of 4.

====================================
Franglais: I've bought the Standard, 956 and the Durbar.

Navy rolls + Night cap are on my list. I'm currently hesitating on the morning pipe.
--
phonkubot: I had Early Morning Pipe this weekend with a cup of joe, it's beautifully blended and smokes beautifully. Tip!
