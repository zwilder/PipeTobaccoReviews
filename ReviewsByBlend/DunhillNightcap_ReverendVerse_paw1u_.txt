Review: Dunhill Nightcap

Okay, so we all know about it. We all talk about it. So, it's time to review it. 

It's been awhile since I've smoked this blend. I'm smoking a bowl as I write this. This is a very smooth blend and as far as english blends go, it's very light. This blend is great for people who are new to english blends and old pros. 

This blends latakia, turkish, perique and virginias together. The latakia is very light. It seems to be a trend among newer english blends to go heavy on the latakia. Which is fine, if you enjoy the full bodied notes of latakia, but if you're looking for something a bit milder, then Nightcap fits the bill. The latakia is very mild and we only get hints of it's distinctive earthiness. The perique, much like the latakia, is very light. Don't expect the strong perique flavor of something like Frog Morton on the Bayou. It's only in the aftertaste when I taste a little bit of the peppery bite that you would expect of perique. Some people think the perique is stronger than the latakia, and some think the opposite. I think there is a perfect fine balance between the two, battling for your palate. The virginias just add to the overall mild and mellow flavor of this tobacco.

The tobacco, out of a fresh tin is a bit wet, a bit more than I'm used to. That's a matter of personal preference, but as I smoke it right now, I'm getting gurgling, which hasn't happened to me in a long time. The smell out of the tin isn't anything extraordinary. It's smells of a typical english blend, nice, but nothing that just grabs you. 

The room note, like any english blend, probably won't be to the liking of non-pipe smokers. I've heard the term 'electrical fire', but I have smelled worse. It burns very well. Even after the false light, I haven't had to relight the bowl yet. 

I'm drinking a dram of Laphroaig 10 with this bowl and it pairs rather nicely. I would imagine it would work very well with coffee and tea. 

I personally like more latakia and/or perique in my blends, but the harmony between all the tobaccos makes for a perfect mellow blend. This blend comes highly recommended for those evenings when you want something light to go along with your nightcap.

HellOnAStick: Nice review. I really have only taken a step toward 'real' tobacco in the last year, but I'm learning much from your review and others. good work.

ilikemike: if you want to know the ultimate va/lat/perique - try james foxes dorisco mixture.

blows anything from dunhill out of the water IMO.
