Tobacco Review: Hearth and Home Anniversary Kake

Review #8

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Homes Anniversary Kake

**Description on Tin:** To Celebrate the 1st anniversary of Hearth & Home tobaccos, this special blend was created. Contrasting Virginias combined with Perique, heat-treated and pressed, then crumbled into an easy-to-pack tobacco with a mouth-watering chocolate and fig pouch aroma.
 
**Leaf:** Dark brown, reddish, with bits of yellow (roan I guess is the right word) clumps of ribbon compacted into flat pancake chunks.

**Tin Aroma:** Red wine vinegar. Sweet and tangy. Not too far off the McClleland funk, but more appetizing. 

**Taste:** Takes a minute or so to get through the charring lights and into the bowl proper. Tastes amazingly akin to the jar aroma - tangy, slightly sweet on the exhale. And yes, a distinct red wine vinegarrines to it. The perique declares its intentions early, in a spicy, slightly fruity attack, which reminds me of jalopenos at the moment. There are depths and hidden corners here, a darkness not of night, but of the evening, where the sun has set, but still lights the sky. Cocoa, yeah. First, just notes on the odd puff, but as you burn deeper, it grows, combining with the citrus tanginess and red wine flavors to create a sort of rolling sherry flavor. The pepper is there, but it actually lets off as you descend, not build like so many others, just adding a spice to the winey stew. It is complex and delicious.

**Smokability:** Can be a bit moist. I break it up roughly then dry for about 30 minutes. Doesn't take the light too friendly, but once you have it cherried, it will heed the yoke.

When I first smoked this - in my very green days - this would bite, not your tongue, but your whole mouth. I thought this was the perique, but no, it was tobacco bite. After 1-2 months in the jar, this goes away. But it will bite like a lust-drunk teenager if you chief it a bit hard.

The mouthfeel is, on the whole, a bit thin, which is the only place this smoke loses marks - it does getty plenty thick when you are chasing the dottle, but that's like a kiss from your crush on her wedding day.

**Room Note:** A bit cigaretty. I wish it smelled better, but the way it tastes makes up for the smoker's stink.

**Thoughts:** This was the first great tobacco I smoked, the first to make me set upright and say 'Yowiee!', well, maybe not yowiee, that is not in my active vocabulary, but it was the first that fully convinced me that I was going to be pipe smoker for life. It is still one of my favorite blends. It is very similar to Blackwoods, but not as heavy in flavor, slightly sweeter, and is not made of asbestos.

**Summary:** A flavorful, well-behaved virginia-perique blend with distinct cocoa, citrus, and red-wine notes.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
crimsonrat: Nice review. I actually just got a tin of this in a trade that's 4 years old. Might be time to pop it open.

majkeli: I have a 4 year old tin that I popped open and moved to a mason jar last year when the rusting tin thing came to light.  I held back a bowl's worth and it was nice and smooth.  Cocoa and figs.  I think I gave you a bit last year in that big bunch of samples, that stuff was about 6 years old.
--
crimsonrat: You might have. You sent me a bunch of neat different things to try!

dnemets: Glad to hear that trade went through. Smoke it in good health.
