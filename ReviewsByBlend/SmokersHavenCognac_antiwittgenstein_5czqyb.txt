Tobacco Review: Smoker's Haven Cognac Mixture

Review # 80

**Blend Name:** Smoker’s Haven Cognac Mixture
 
**Description on Tin:** The tremendous popularity of the Cognac style of GBD pipe at Smokers' Haven, Inc., made it quickly imperative for us to develop a fit running-mate for this sweet smoking GBD style, our new Cognac Mixture. 
The top quality string cut Virginia is carefully blended with choice Syrian Latakia and a delightful dash of exotic Turkish with the addition of the finest Cognac flavouring. A taste and aroma never before experienced in any other quality blend of tobacco.
You will quickly discover that our new Cognac Mixture is extremely slow burning, powder dry to the last flake of tobacco, with a delightful taste and aroma that will please all!

**Leaf:** Nutty brown shag
 
**Tin Aroma:** Very light. A bit of bread? Something sweet and a touch of raisins.

**Taste:** Soapy burley. It isn’t a bad soap, but it is there and noticeable, for those of you who are sensitive. It gives it a bit of perfume. The burley is nice and earthy, veering into cigar territory. Is that Cognac? There is occasionally a sweet, somewhat sour, a bit oaky, and very spirity flavor. And something mouth puckering vinegar, like Turkish or Virgina, I can’t tell. There is a vague savory taste, going between cooking herbs and creamy soup that makes me lean towards Turkish. It is fairly simple at the start, staying this for about halfway down the bowl, when suddenly a spice comes out of nowhere. It doesn’t taste like perique or dark fired, just general, tobacco pepperiness, again almost like you would find in a cigar. That builds progressively, and the burley fades as the Turkish (maybe) comes forward. It yin-yangs between sharp and creamy. The nuttiness returns here and there, and there are still a few puffs that outright scream cognac. After starting off a bit boring I am sad to see it fade to ash.
 
**Nicotine:** 3, what you would expect from a mild English

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** The more I have shag cut the more I like it. It lends itself to mindless packing, just shove a clump in your bowl and light. The airy nature means you have to tamp a bit more often or face relights. I unfortunately noticed some tongue bit towards the end of the bowl.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside. My beard smells like toasty tobacco.

**Thoughts:** This is another solid offering from Smoker’s Haven, the second sample, you might have noticed, included with the /r/pipetobacco 2016 POTY. I did not smoke this in my POTY, that is reserved for burley blends, for those of you keeping score at home. Between this and the Select Mixture, I am pretty excited to try out the rest of the SH range. Both showed off not just good source baccy, but a deftness mixing the elements to something interesting, having balance and evolution. Even more surprising is my ability to catch the cognac in this stuff, despite my tendency to overdry everything I smoke. You might have a more pronounced boozy experience if you don’t desiccate yours, but I like that it is just a mild topping that shows here and there to add interest to this blend. If you are not like me and can’t taste (or actually like) the soapy taste from Latakia, bump the score below up a notch.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Billy Budd, Squadron Leader
 
**Summary:** A sometimes spicy burley forward mild english

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2.5 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the filter of someone with Flat Aspect variant schizophrenia, i.e. literally):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (I can’t stop thinking about and craving this tobacco no matter how long ago I smoked it. I fantasize about our life together. I might be literally in love with this blend.)

(++++) Great (I will be thinking about this smoke for the next day or two and use it as a benchmark for other blends)

(+++) Very good (I am impressed and get bummed when the bowl finishes)

(++) Good (I can recommend this without reservations but I am not going to start hoarding it)

(+) I think like it (This is just barely a positive experience but I am not convinced)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Meh. Either I am indifferent to it or it has balancing bad or good qualities)

(-) I think I dislike this (There was something mildly off-putting about this. I am not going to throw it away but I will hesitate to smoke it again.)

(--)This is not for me (It is most likely quality leaf but mixed, topped, or cased in something that isn’t my personal taste, but that I could see how many people might like something like this, or think the bite or burley mouth may be worth it.)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (This is clearly bad. This is low quality tobacco, bad casing, bad mixing, or just a bad batch.)

(----)This is suffering (I am going to throw or give this away, but not to anyone I like. I am not going to smoke my pipe for a few days while the memory lingers. I am going to have to salt’n’booze treat my pipe afterwards.)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (This is most likely a Lakeland. I will briefly consider giving up pipe smoking forever so that I don’t chance having this sensory experience again.)
====================================
SupraMario: Nice review, the name Smokers Haven always makes me think of cheap RYO. These blends sound great though like a captain black replacement.

Awesome review as always
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. I had the same thoughts and when these samples showed up, I had expected them to be goopy Aros. When I went over to tobaccoreviews to pull the description, I read that the blending is done for SH by a certain blender of pretty high renown, which I won't mention here until I can stock up.
--
SupraMario: Nice, this sounds like some stuff I need to grab, the name is what has kept me away from it, I know that's not a good thing, at least I know to try it now.
--
hello_josh: It's high quality leaf and blended by Germain (Esoterica). Smoker's Haven and Esoterica have an interesting history :

luthiermark: Interesting. I had always suspected that Penzance was an "upgraded" version of Margate, but had never read or heard anything confirming as much.
--
SupraMario: O nice! Man time to grab some and find which I like best.
--
givemeyours0ul: The stuff is usually harder to find than esoterica. The cat is out of the bag. Why do you think Smokers Haven =  Cheap RYO? Did they do that for a while?
--
carnesy: There's a cheap RYO brand called [Smoker's Pride](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/pipe-tobacco/73384/smokers-pride-rich/) and possibley one called smoker's something-or-other that he may be thinking of.

====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Great review as always. My poty is being made, hoping I get a sample of this as well! Can't wait!
--
hello_josh: Did you go for the Buckeye or handmade? My Buckeye is pretty fantastic.
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: I splurged and got the handmade. I have been a big fan of Premal's work for while and couldn't pass up such a great value for one of his handmades. Can't wait for it to get finished up. 
--
hello_josh: Maybe I should add one to the Christmas list before it's too late!
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Do it!
--
====================================
LegesAequitas: Good stuff, brother. I find a lot of burley forward blends are fairly cigar-like to me. Sounds like a fun tasting here in any case, lots going on.
--
====================================
cgrd: Is Esoterica's Pembroke pretty much the same?
--
antiwittgenstein: I can't say with experience, but I think other people have noted similarities and differences.
