Review: Lane BCA

I'm cycling through samples of Lane's much vilified aromatics as supplemental smokes (next, Dark Red).  
  
On a night where I have plenty of time, smoking English/Balkan, followed by a cigar, and then a dessert aromatic is my ideal.  
  
Where to start with Lane BCA?  Words that came to mind while smoking it: silky, smooth, smooth, silky, damn, fine, yum.  
  
Lane BCA is 100% black Cavendish (green River Burley) **cased in Jessica Alba's essence and then dressed in her underwear drawer.** The flavorings people list are vanilla and liquor but the amalgam of top notes just worked together to make a uniform flavor for me. BCA tastes/smells like BCA.  
  
The nuttiness of the Burley is lost in the Cavendish process here. As is all harshness. The typical complaint about aromatics is that they lack flavor. BCA actually has flavor _and_ aftertaste but it is hard to describe. It's pleasant, not in your face, but it's there.  This wasn't overly vanilla-ish to me. Whatever the top dressing is, doesn't come across as a bottle of artificial vanilla like I was expecting.  
  
How to smoke this? I see three main types of pipers smoking this regularly.  
1. all day smokers who enjoy it  
2. dessert smokers (or who smoke pairings like me)  
3. seasoning tobacco. Like Carter Hall, people tend to mix BCA into other things. Some people will add BCA to a blend to take a little harsh out.  
  
Most tobacco reviews are largely unhelpful to me because they tend to sound too haughty as if people are LARP'ing being millionaires waxing about their pipes.  I'll give you a simple way to TL;DR:  
  
**If Lane BCA was sold as Dunhill Black Tuxedo, people would swear it's the only BlackCav they smoke and pay 3x for it... for special occasions... like when I'm entertaining friends on my yacht... ::dons monocle::**

Oripmav: To me (an inexperienced pioe smoker) it reminds me of sweet iced tea.

wheelman406: BCA is yum, and I was contemplating purchasing Dark Red with my next purchase. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on it.

Fuzzy_Totemz: I waited until I had smoked half an ounce of BCA before commenting on it. I think I sent the other half to coldsolder.  
  
First impression on Dark Red, is that it smells/tastes like the BlackCav component from Blood Red Moon. After half an ounce I'll comment on whether that's accurate or if it's good/bad.  
  
And maybe someone will ask for Dark Red on the contest thread so I can mail them the other half ounce and move on to the next Lane blend in my drawer.
