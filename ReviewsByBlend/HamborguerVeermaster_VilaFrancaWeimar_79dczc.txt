Hamborguer Veermaster - A Review
By: VilaFrancaWeimar
---
"Hamburg's four master" is an old XIX century sailor's song, and the "germanized" version of "The Banks of Sacramento". A work song that is sung in low German. The song tells the story of a dirty old sailing ship filled with shit, grease, lice, green rotting meat and smelly sailors with high hopes of arriving to a prosperous and tidy America. 
Let me tell you, my friends, that this tobacco perfectly captures that. Not the smelly and terrible parts of the ship, but the subtle and joyous sweetness of the sailor's hope.
 
Hamborger Veermaster is a straight Virginia flake from Dan Tobacco with little to no casing, and a great pipe tobacco!

1- Before smoking:
-It has perfectly formed flakes, the smell is light and hay like. There is a slight hint of cocoa when your nose gets real close. The flakes look amazing and I used the fold and stuff method in many different pipes, it worked in almost all of them. It smells sweet, but not to sweet to dissuade me (I am usually an English fan).

2- Beginning of the smoke: 
- It is a Virginia and it tastes like one, but it is particularly subtle. In the beginning you will probably be more concentrated on keeping it lit. 

3- During the smoke:
-Carefully smoke it cool. I haven't got any tongue bite from it, but i get the sense that since it is kind of hard to keep it lit in the start, you run the risk of smoking it fast and hot during that period.
-When you get to the flavor of it, you realize it is very neutral (in a good way). It is really inoffensive and it seems great for a good read or to complement an activity. It is an easy tobacco and doesn't ask too much of you. It is light, nice, and not to sweet. 
-Towards the end it starts to get real creamy in a very surprising way. I have experienced it in different pipes and in different situations, and the creaminess is notable (always in the ending) in much of those situations. 

4- After the smoke:
-The after taste and beard note are very neutral also. It doesn't smell or feel like you have been puffing away for an hour. It even makes me feel kind of reinvigorated when I smoke during the afternoon. But of course, this is my subjective experience, and it might vary a lot.

Overview:
It is a great daylight tobacco. If you want something that doesn't ask too much from you, or you just want something light that doesn't stink up the place with the smell of vanilla, this is for you. If you are used to aromatics this would be a great transition to tobaccos with a more natural flavor, granted you can get used to the flake form. It is also great to go out with, since it has no unpleasant scent. Go out drinking or boating with it. It really has no need to be a sit down type of tobacco like an heavy English would.

Recommended readings:
Something real heavy, because you don't have to concentrate that deeply on the tobacco or search for flavors. Jewish Hermeneutics, European Modernist Poetry, maybe Heidegger.

I hope you liked the review and have patience with my grammar, I am not a native speaker.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Thanks a lot man. Really glad you liked it! It's a first review, so probably it's not great, but I wanted to make it fun. Do you have any tips for improving?

brainskan13: Great review. Thanks. This is one I have meant to try forever and haven't gotten around to sampling yet.

Pilikki: Nice review, I really enjoy the "beermaster" during summer. I would definitely recommend it to people who like Orlik Golden Sliced.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you, maybe I'll keep them up. Glad you liked it!

wangchung80: Although available in the US, a friend of mine recently went to Germany and brought back 16 tins of German tobacco. Two were of this variety. Thank you for the review and I look forward to trying this blend. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Age one of them, they really age well like any straight Virginia. Dan tobacco generally has a good line of tobacco, what are your other tins? Have you tried them? Thank you!

wangchung80: Jubilee 40, discovery, Germain mixture #7 and SLF, Derrick Pfeifenladen 900 & Latakia f, veermaster, and donâ€™t remember the others. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Seems like you have some pretty fantastic blends. Let us know if you liked them, and of course, it you like Veermaster.

antiwittgenstein: I object, one should under no circumstances recommend Heidegger. Unless you meant late Heidegger, maybe. 

You have a nice, unique review style, I look forward to more of these.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you sir, really apreciate your words and reviews. It will take a little while for the next one, I am not accustomed to your reviewing speed!

ShwimmingAway: I'll definitely have to pick this up as half my ancestry is low German! My grandpa actually speaks it (learned English in kindergarten) but refuses to teach anyone since it's unusable with anyone but hillbillies (his words) in Germany.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Great! Ask him to teach you the song!
