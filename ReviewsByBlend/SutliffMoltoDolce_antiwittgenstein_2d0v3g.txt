Tobacco Review: Sutliff Molto Dolce
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #5

**Blend Name:** Molto Dolce

**Description on Tin:** Rich and creamy Vanilla, Caramel, and Honey applied to Burley, Virginia, and Black Cavendish.
 
**Leaf:** Medium ribbons, about half brown and half black by volume. It is practically wet to the touch.

**Tin Aroma:** Deeply perfumed and overwhelming, like stepping into a funeral parlor full of bouquets. Rich tobacco is layered with heaps of vanilla bean, caramel, and a lingering, unknown sweet spice.

**Taste:** At first, smoky air with a creamy texture and faintly sweet taste on the exhale. Just past the true light, vanilla custard, but fainter than you might expect. Theres a real caramel, or if you prefer, dulce de leche, flavor that comes every so often through the finish. Can have an acrid bitterness on relights or if hotboxed. Towards the end of the bowl, the aromatic flavors give up, and it is just bland smoke. No point pushing past this flavor. Ash and go. 

**Smokability:** Lights well and stays lit despite being moist. I dried a bowl for about a day and was still slightly moist to the touch. But the flavors didn't diminish much and the smoke wasn't really any different. Creates a creamy velvety texture that is quite enjoyable, if a bit too thin to make a proper ring.

**Room Note:** Better smelling than my best vanilla candle.

**Thoughts:** You hear this pretty often when people speak of this blend 'The 1st bowl was perfect.' I have to echo that statement. This is only my 3rd aromatic, but with the previous two, I had a hard time picking out any distinct flavors. With the first bowl out of this one it was a bowl of smoked ice cream. The subsequent bowls have been pretty consistent, being sweet, with a bit of the caramel-vanilla-custard flavor coming through, but not rocking heavy like it once did. There is a general consensus that this is near the top of the affordable aromatic game. It ain't bad, but it doesn't bring the flavor like any naturally flavorful blend, like say Orlik Golden Sliced or Hearth and Home Larry's Blend.

**Summary:** A pretty solid vanilla-dulce-de-leche aromatic that will keep you chasing after that first high.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
LegesAequitas: Nice review. If the first bowl was perfect, how many bowls did you smoke to get to this review? I'm not much of an aromatic smoker either, but this one sounds decent. The one aromatic I swear by is Peterson Sunset Breeze because it's pretty consistent and has a strong flavor throughout the smoking process (if you're puffing carefully). Also, love the new review rating system.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I had about 5-6 bowls of this. 

It is definitely better out of briar. I meant to mention that in the review. It is also better out of a shorter pipe. I even did a side by side, smoking alternately out of my MM Washington and MM mini - the smoke was a bit hotter yes, but the sweetness and vanilla came through much stronger.
--
LegesAequitas: That's pretty neat. What was the difference between cob (or meerschaum?) and briar? Also, do you have ideas on why the flavor was better in a shorter pipe?
--
antiwittgenstein: The cob lends its own bit of sweetness to the smoke, while the briar seemed a bit drier. 

I think the shorter stemmed cob tasted better because the smoke was still a bit warm - if I remember correctly, our taste buds pick out sweetness better at higher temperatures. Like if you eat ice cream vs letting it melt - the melted stuff tastes much sweeter. Or if you are whisky drinker, how much sweeter good booze is when it is at room temp vs when it is on the rocks.
--
LegesAequitas: Intriguing. For me aromatics tend to taste better at a cooler temperature, but everyone is different. I am a big whisky drinker and I do agree with you, although I like mine a bit cooler than room temperature, perhaps 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
--
Chrisj2001: And not just sweets, cold numbs the taste buds inhibits all flavor. Ever wonder why Jaeger is served at a degree above freezing? ;p same reason good cheese is not served straight from the fridge.

tehgeeksquad: I smoked this in a new stanwell  de luxe 95 9mm (which i love btw). The first smoke was wonderful. The second was not as good but I think that was my fault as I was not really giving it my full attention. However both smokes gave me a weird tingling sensation in my mouth and on my teeth that did not subside for at least an hour. I am wondering if that was the nicotine or if there is some chemical in my new pipe.

====================================
ConnorTLaw: I've heard a lot of good comments on this tobacco, and I really like two of Sutliff's other aromatics. I'll pick it up if I see it around town.

voteforabetterpotato: Thanks for the review. 

At present I have a aromatic blend which is "ok" but leaves me wanting to find better flavours. I had my eyes on Molto Dulce but I think I'll keep looking. I'm after something that delivers somewhat continuous flavour without too much nicotine - if such a tobacco exists.

antiwittgenstein: If you find it, let us know.
