====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: **Review #8**

**Name:** Mac Baren Plumcake

**Description On Tin:** A mixture of fully ripe Virginia tobaccos, sliced, cask mellowed Burley tobaccos, dark spicy Cavendish and just a touch of Latakia. To give Plumcake an elegant aroma the blend has been flavoured with aged Jamaica Rum.

**Leaf:** Ribbon cut, mostly a medium to light brown with some dark ribbons and tiny little dark clumps scattered throughout. Moisture wasn't too bad, you could smoke it straight out of the tin, but sometimes Mac Baren tends to bite my tongue like a starving Hyena, so I give it 20 minutes to dry out.

**Tin Aroma:** I was expecting big things given the tin description. I did pick up a bit of the rum which was nice, the latakia was practically undetectable, but the virgina was there smelling fresh and sweet, but not overly so. The nice tobacco scent of the burley was a welcome change from the heavier Lat blends I have been huffing lately. The spiciness lent by the cavendish was also very nice. It smells like it should.

**Taste:** The Latakia that was nearly missing in the tin aroma was there straight away, it was at the front at the first light, but very quickly moved aside and spent most of the remainder of the smoke lingering in the background. The sweetness of the cavendish and freshness of the VA's takes over from there, but it is well balanced out by a pleasant spiciness, and the bitterness (for lack of a better word) of the Rum. The rum flavoring sticks around for most of the bowl and is actually quite tasty, but it never overpowers the smoke, it is only a light flavoring in my book. The burley is lightly nutty and full and helps keep everything tied together. The overall smoke is very rich and creamy, although not terribly 'strong' in flavor, it is tasty and smooth though. Towards the last portion of the bowl the Latakia returns and comes toward the front again where it finishes on a smokey high note, well supported by the sweetness that still remains. The rum grows weaker towards this point but never disappears completely. 

**Smokeability:** With a few minutes drying time it was great, it packed well, lit easily, and stayed lit very well with only a bit of tamping and one relight. It billows sweet smelling smoke and burns cool enough to enjoy, although I get the feeling it would bite if you really puffed away hard. It burns down to a fairly fine white ash,
and didn't leave any goopiness on my bowl or stem. Excellent Smokeabilty.

**Summary:** Sweet, smokey, rich and smooth, with a pleasant rum hint throughout. This is a very nice tobacco but not a world beater in my book. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if I saw it in front of me, but it isn't knocking off any of my favourites. A solid performer with a good taste profile and nice manners, Give it a try
if you are curious, if the tin description sounds nice you will enjoy it, as it lives up to it's claims. I wish it tasted more like plum cake though, the name itself confuses me a little haha.

**Score** **3/5**

**My Background:** I have only been smoking pipes for around 8 months.In that time I have worked my way through a number of blends, finding English/Balkan/Oriental blends to be my thing. I am currently working on expanding my palate for different styles, and improving my knowledge and understanding of the pipe and tobacco art.

**P.S** I gotta stop writing these at midnight, I'm half asleep now.....

====================================
marchettejw: MacBaren Plumcake was one of the first tinned tobaccos I tried, I have to say that I was not a fan due to the extremely easy toung bite. With that said I ran out of the tobacco that I was smoking and turned to this. After a bit of experience with a pipe this turned out to be a delightfuly complex blend that made me miss it when my tin was gone. Now I keep an extra tin on hand, along with Old Dark Fired, and Dunhil Elizabethan Mixture.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Yes it can bite can't it! But if you treat it well it rewards you. I quite enjoy it.

pwny_: I smoke this blend in the same pipe I use for FMC. If you're a fan of the latter, give this one a try. They're not entirely similar, but will have the familiarity you're seeking.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: What is FMC?

pwny_: Frog Morton Cellar.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Ahh yes... How embarrassing haha. I have a tin at home I'm yet to try.

beaker75: Nice review, that's pretty much what i think about Plumcake too. Rum flavor is quite tasty, but i wouldn't wanna smoke that stuff all day. 

--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thankyou.
It's definitely not a bad smoke, but there are better all day options. A little too much care needed avoiding bite , and too much drying time needed, for this to be my all day. It's a nice treat.
