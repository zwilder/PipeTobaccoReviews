I know there have been a few reviews on this tobacco, but I'm just keeping up with the promise made to /u/TurnerJ5 about sending us these tins in promise of a review.  

**Pipe**: Peterson 2014 St. Patricks Day Canadian.  This pipe has become my flake tobacco pipe and figured it'd work just fine with coined tobaccos.  

**Description on Tin**: The choicest Virginias, Burleys and dark fired Kenyan leaf are enhanced with an impeccable addition of spicy Perique, then aged to perfection before being spun into enticingly beautiful, zesty coins. A delightfully vivacious and flavorful smoke.

**Leaf/Looks**:  The tin was packed with tobacco, a mixture of good looking coins (as expected from the name) and ribbon cut (most likely tobacco that has just broken off from the coin).  The coins itself looked like there was no structure to how the tobacco was stacked prior to rolling.  Some had the yellow virginias on the outside with the darker burley/kenyan/perique leaves in the center and some coins had a mixture of colors all throughout.  The tobacco came fairly dry, as many other reviews have alerady mentioned.  I rubbed out 5 coins that fit the entire bowl of this pipe.  

**Tin Note/Smell**:  The tin note smelled like dried fruit to me, raisins or prunes.  The usual smell I can get from uncased/unflavored tobaccos.  It reminded me of cigars and from that alone, I thought it was going to be a bold smoke like a cigar, but that wasn't the case.

**Taste**:  From the first light, I was getting some nutty flavors upfront, something like cashew or almond, with the spicy tingle of perique just hanging back until the finish.  Towards the middle of the bowl, I was getting a lot more of a nice sweetness along with the nutty, but the spicy perique was a bit more prominent than just being on the finish.  Towards the end of the bowl, nothing really changed except for the spiciness mellowing out a bit.  Really nice flavors.  Throughout the bowl, I noticed a smokey flavor, but couldn't tell if it was the burley or the dark fired kenyan.  

**Room Note**:  I can't say much about the aroma of this as I smoked it outside and there was a very light breeze taking the smoke away from me.  

**Smokeability/Strength**:  Since the tobacco was fairly dry, the tobacco took to light very easily and stayed lit the entire way.  I had to relight maybe one or twice at most because I left the pipe alone to run inside the house.  I was able to smoke it down to white ash, as well, probably attributed to the dryness.  As far as strength goes, I said earlier that I thought it was going to be strong and bold like a cigar since the tin note reminded me of a cigar, but it was a medium at best.  Got a nice nicotine buzz from it, but it's not something that will knock your socks off.   

**Summary**:  I really enjoyed this tobacco.  Nice flavors, great performance, not too strong.  Since the date on tin says 'June 2014', it is a very, very young blend.  I could see this being an everyday smoke for someone who really like vaper blends.  I am really interested to see how this tobacco ages and definitely do plan to smoke more of it in the near future.  Thanks again to /u/TurnerJ5 for the haiku contest and the tobacco!
