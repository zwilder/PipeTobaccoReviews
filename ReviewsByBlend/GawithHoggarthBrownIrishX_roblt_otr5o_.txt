Review--G&H Brown Irish X rope tobacco

Normally, I don't do this but I've never seen anything on this tobacco here. So I ordered a foot and a half of this stuff; it came in the mail today and I just got done smoking it. Here's some quick notes:

Strength: As far as I have read, it's the strongest pipe tobacco out there. Not *one of* the strongest. **The** strongest. There's a good nicotine kick, which I never feel from pipe tobacco. If you don't react well to cigars or chew, stay away. 

Flavor: It tastes like a cigar at first, but further into the bowl you get more mellow flavors that remind you it's pipe tobacco. 

Room note: Similar to a cigar. This is not one that will have people running up and saying how great it smells. 

Preparation: I just cut off a coin and rubbed it out into the bowl. I won't be doing this again; it was really hard to keep lit because of the moisture. I recommend rubbing it out and letting it dry for at least 20 minutes. In the future I'll also try chewing it for a while and then drying it out. Sounds gross, but that's how they used to do it. 

I'd love to answer any questions you guys have on this stuff. It's not an all-day smoker, but once in a while it could be very nice.

wolv: I've been wanting to try Black Irish X for awhile. I have 1.5kg of Brown Bogie that I've been aging for the past 2 years or so...I should crack one of those jars open sometime soon...

Why_Cheesoid_Exist: Please try the chewing and drying thing and post your results.  I'm a fan of nicotine in nearly any form, and that actually sounds pretty cool.  Seems like the nicotine would be mostly gone after that process, or maybe you take it out prematurely?

roblt: Will do. Apparently that's the way coal miners used to do it--they'd chew it during the day underground because open flame+coal dust = bad. They'd stuff the leftovers into a pouch so it would dry out. That night, they'd smoke the dried-out dregs back home.
