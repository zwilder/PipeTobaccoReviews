Review: Cornell & Diehl's Corn Cob Pipe (and a Button Nose)
By: freepancakesforall

My name is James and I live almost exclusively off three main food groups: Virginias, Balkans, and holiday aromatics. Here we go!

**Blend Name:** Corn Cob Pipe (And A Button Nose)    

**Description on Tin:** A warm mug of cocoa flecked with marshmallow. It's cold outside. Your pipe's alight. It's looking like it might snow. If bright, gold Virginias fulfill your Christmas wish, blend in some reds. It's quite a spread. With burley and cavendish. A blend for the season, warmed with Christmas cheer makes our "Corncob Pipe and a Button Nose" for the best day of the year!    
   
**Leaf:** Virginia, burley, and cavendish in a (micro-)cube cut.

**Tin Aroma:** A mug of cocoa with lab-created marshmallows bobbing on the surface. And some figgy pudding.    

**Taste:** This blend tastes almost exactly how it smells in the tin. I'd say the leading note of this is a fantastic burley, laying down the base of cocoa and nutty goodness. Then I pick up the cavendish adding that vanilla marshmallow highlight. And finally (and most welcomed), the virginias. They linger in the background and add a light sprinkling of figs that have been soaked overnight in a dark rum. They're somewhat fleeting in this blend for me, but when they hit, they hit beautifully.

**Smokability:** One of the easiest blends out there to smoke. Perfect moisture out of the tin and the cube cut packs beautifully. I just drop a few pinches in, tamp lightly, and light up. And for the worried, non-aros out there, this is not a goopy blend. It packs and smokes just like a regular burley blend.   

**Thoughts:** This is a fantastic holiday release. Is it a one-note aromatic? Of course. But that note is a toasty mug of cocoa to fill your pipe on a cold winter night. My only gripe is that I start losing the secondary flavors half-way through and by the end feel like I'm smoking a bowl of Carter Hall (which isn't the worst thing). So my solution has been to pack smaller bowls and smoke it on shorter sessions. So, naturally, this blend has become my go-to cold weather dog-walking blend.       

**Summary:** A richly flavored, easy smoking holiday aromatic that tastes just how it smells.    

And on that note, I'm going to go walk my dog.    

====================================
crimblade: I love the cube cut of this blend, and agree on the flavor going kaput halfway through the bowl. I now do the bottom half of a pipe with this and the top half with an English, works pretty great.

Thanks for the review!

FullFrontalNoodly: How does that work?  I would tend to think you'd get all the aromatics while smoking through the English and then still be left with more or less straight burley in the second half.

Personally, I think I'd just make myself a nice cup of hot chocolate and drink that while smoking my pipe.
--
crimblade: You do, but part of the reason an ark loses its flavor, at least for me, is that you get used to it. This keeps it fresher and gives you a unique smoke along the way.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Based on my experiences doing parfaits, I would definitely think it would work better the other way around.
--
freepancakesforall: I'm going to try this but with some Red Cake. Thanks!

====================================
cgrd: Thanks for including a picture of the tobacco in your review.

====================================
boomermax: Personally I thought it sucked.

Maybe it was an overused cob with lingering ghosts being the cause of it.  I'll give it a go in my meerschaum and see if it presents itself any better.
--
freepancakesforall: I'd give it another go. (Or not, I don't work for C&D).    

I only smoke it out of a designated aro pipe. So the typical other blends in there are a 1Q, WO Larsen, or other vanilla Danish blends.    

If I smoked this in one of my english or balkan pipes I'd probably be disappointed. 
--
givemeyours0ul: I haven't tried this, I got the mixture monster and couldn't get good flavor from it. I'm just not an aro guy I guess.
--
boomermax: I've run the gambit on aros and found some I've liked and some that were just flat.  All of the C&Ds I've tried have fallen into this last category.

I think it's the burley.  I've had some non aro C&Ds that I've enjoyed.


--
givemeyours0ul: Well, I've got Holiday Spirit, Firedance flake,  and some cult BLOOD RED, so I'm going to try a few more non C&D.
--
boomermax: I love Firedance.  Take your time with it.  Pick up an ounce of 2000 fragrant mature cake
--
freepancakesforall: This was the first C&D blend that worked for me. I'm with you on the flatness of others.
--
====================================
mugwump867: Nice review.  This was the first of C&D's annual holiday blends that actually worked for me.  It's still a tad rough but I expect a bit of aging will smooth things out.  I'm a big fan of that cube cut as it is the perfect complement for a cob -- as the name would suggest.
--
====================================
Ferivich: I've tended to stick with a smaller pipe (Pony Express or something along those lines) with this blend and have really enjoyed it this season.
--
====================================
pebrain21: I just got a tin yesterday and haven't tried it yet.  I'm looking forward to it.  Thanks for posting this.
--
====================================
p4ttythep3rf3ct: I didn't really like this one.  Too artificial to me, and the cut was too small for my liking.
--
TheNutPair: Extremely cigarettey room note too.  Like wet old cigarette room note. 
--
====================================
majkeli: If anyone wants to swap a 1/2 oz or so of this for some Peterson Holiday Season, hit me up.
--
freepancakesforall: I'd be down for that. 2016?
--
majkeli: Yep.  Lets move to PM to swap addresses.
