[Review] Sutliff Tobacco Company – Christmas Spice – or – To suffer the slings and aromatics
By: AdamantFinn

I have a difficult relationship with San Francisco. I really love the city, it’s like Boston, where I grew up, only with more hills and Golden Gate Bridges and less racism and violence. I love Oakland and Berkeley. The food is terrific. There is a pervasive notion of inclusiveness and responsibility towards one another which is nice and also weirdly undermined by the masses of indigent people that could use a little help and aren’t getting any. Three of the great lost loves of my life live there and it's where a number of my lesser heartbreaks began. I have yet to learn that it is a mistake for me to bring a girlfriend to San Francisco as the trip has always marked the beginning of the end. It never snows in San Francisco but their summers are colder than Boston winters. Living in Los Angeles, I miss the rain and the cold from my New England upbringing. So I continue to think it’s a good idea to head up there on Thanksgiving for more traditional weather and some history slightly deeper than then 1960’s. 

The Saint Francis is a beautiful, old hotel, right on Union Square. Traditional in every sense with uniformed bellman and century old restaurants. They have a coin washer on staff to make sure the change won’t stain ladies' white gloves…. seriously. Just before Thanksgiving, they fill the multi-story lobby with sugar castles and model trains and a huge, live Christmas tree. The lobby and really the whole city are filled with the excitement and aromas of the holidays.

**The Blender:** Sutliff Tobacco Company, based in Richmond, VA was purchased by the Danish company Mac Baren Tobacco in 2013. Sutliff produces many, popular bulk and tinned pipe tobaccos.

**The Blend:** Christmas Spice

**The Tin:** Depending on from whom you purchase Christmas Spice you may get either a green zippered Ziplock or red zippered Ziplock or maybe even a clear zippered Ziplock bag. None of which are collectible.

**The Tobacco:** Dark, reddish Virginia ribbons with highlights of Black Cavendish and brown Burley. It is notable that Sutliff decided to use Virginia as their base rather than a Cavendish. Because of this, the blend tends to feel more “naturally” moist. It is easier to manage than a traditional aromatic and can be smoked right from the bag.

**Upon Opening:**  There is what I can only think of as an aged cinnamon aroma up front, solidly supported by a vanilla that is just on the edge of becoming caramel. It is not whimsical or cheap.

**The Smoke:** “Oh, this is a good one.” While less moist than most aromatics it is still a bit sticky. It is easy enough to handle. It lights right up and I will usually be able to smoke from the charring light. The tobacco burns clean and well. I don’t love Burleys, but I appreciate their prudent inclusion. Sutliff adds just enough to fill out the spice and give some heft to the smoke. The Virginias are sweet without being grassy. The smoke is consistent, there won’t be pockets of sugar then spice, they are both in every sip. Nicotine is noticeable.

**Conclusion:** Christmas Blend is a mature aromatic, it will hold steady, do what it says and do a good job of it. When I think of aromatics, the first thing that comes even to my mind is cotton candy or pineapple. Sutliff’s Christmas Spice is not that. Sutliff’s Christmas Spice is mulled wine. There is a pleasure and quality to the experience of it. Like walking in from the cold to the lobby of a 100 year-old hotel where a giant tree stands, all lit up and the smells of tradition and the holiday greet you, warmly.

**Strength:** Medium  2/4	**Room:** Medium 2/4	**Taste:** Medium 2/4	**Overall:** 3.5/4

**Reviewers note:** Taking arms against /u/antiwittgenstein sea of troubles

====================================
Old_Deadhead: A very solid review! I'm not a huge aromatic guy, but I can appreciate them on the right occasions. Might have to pick some up for the holiday season. 

Thanks for taking the time to write this up.

AdamantFinn: You are welcome, it is my pleasure to write these (ok, maybe "pleasure" is a bit enthusiastic). I do like aromatics but I completely understand the bias and preference against them. But there are some good ones and it'd be a shame not to try to share them with my fellows.
