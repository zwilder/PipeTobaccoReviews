Tobacco Review: C&D Crowley's Best
By: antiwittgenstein
---
Review # 97

**Blend Name:** Cornell and Diehl Crowley’s Best
 
**Description on Net:** Named for the famed Walter Crowley of Fordham's football glory days, this is a medium strength mixture of Burley, Latakia, and Perique in an uncommonly harmonious natural blend.

**Leaf:** Brown shag, very dry to the touch
 
**Tin Aroma:** Just a little smoky

**Age when smoked:** Factory fresh

**Taste:** Nutty, hay, burley. Dark german table bread. Neither sweet nor dry. Rich tobacco – that otherwise indescribable taste you get from a certain type of tobacco, often found in good burley blends and Maduro wrapped cigars. But let me try to describe it – earthy, creamy, woody, but really not any of those. My mild synthesesia makes me think of rubbing my hands over oiled walnut or resting in an old soft brown leather chair. Stays consistent in flavor. Picks up a tiny hint of woodsmoke in the second half that fades in and out.

**Nicotine:** 4 pushing 5

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** The shag cut and dry nature makes it easy to light, but requires some more aggressive tamping to stay lit. It also burns much faster, making my 30 min burley bowl turn into a quick 15 min smoke. Leaves no dottle whatsoever, burns down to a light grey ash.
 
**Side Stream:** Burley.

**Thoughts:** I have found the missing link of Burley tobacco. Heretofore the progression I had was: Prince Albert, Solani Aged Burley Flake, Haunted Bookshop, Big N Burley, Burley Flake #1, Brown Bogie. It is a fine progression only between the first and second items there is chasm of flavor intensity and nicotine level. Crowley’s Best fits perfectly in that gap. It is full flavored and has some noticeable power, but not so strong that I can’t have it after a light meal or when I haven’t been smoking regularly.

For burley fans who are not enslaved by Queen Nicotina, this could be a fine daily smoke. Otherwise it should be a great intro tobacco of the genre. Finally I think I am going to use this in a similar manner as I do PA, to improve the smoking characteristics of other blends, mellow them out, and unlike PA, inject a little buzz into low nicotine blends.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Prince Albert, Haunted Bookshop
 
**Summary:** Nutty and rich medium nicotine burley blend

**My Background** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the world of Dungeons and Dragons):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Rolling that Natural 20 right when you need to)

(++++) Great (Magic loot! Or Magic lute…)

(+++) Very good (Go ahead and level up your characters)

(++) Good (Nerd Camraderie)

(+) I think like it (The actual Role Playing)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (The rulebook says…)

(-) I think I dislike this (Math for fun?)

(--)This is not for me (You’ve had 20 minutes to decide your next attack, why does it take another 20 when it is your turn?)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Split parties = dead characters)

(----)This is suffering (4 sided dice don’t roll)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (That 3rd missed saving throw)

hedonaut: Always solid. I've been out of the loop for a while. Have you done Morley's Best, yet?

EDIT: Yes, I'm back...

antiwittgenstein: Oh man, you've been gone a peace. Welcome back. I had never heard of Morley's Best - looking it up, I think it might be right up my alley. How does it compare?
--
hedonaut: Crowley's has more latakia and a good slug of black cav in there. Morley's is a recreation of the old Blue Boar Rough Cut. It's predominantly burley with enough VA to mellow it out and latakia for spice. If you had Father the Flame, it's similar with the VA and burley components almost in reverse. It's just about my favorite latakia blend at this point, though I still smoke them rarely compared to burley without latakia.

ShabShoral: Great review! Have you done Brown Flake Unscented? I'd love your thoughts!!! I smoke it whenever I read the Tractatus and I don't see how it's not as popular as Captain Black!

antiwittgenstein: Thanks, I appreciate it. I did review Brown Flake -[it wasn't my thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/34sc86/tobacco_review_brown_flake_unscented/). I had big hopes for it, but I am too sensitive to the lakeland soap.
