[Review] Wilke Pipe Tobacco – Wilke No. 191 – or – Straight as an aromatic

I love chili. It’s great in the summer but even better when the leaves start to turn and the air starts to sharpen. Chili is a dish that can stand on it’s own, delicious and plain or as a foundation to a much more complex dish, sometimes even exotic. One of the great things about cooking chili is that there’s really no wrong way to do it. Ok, that’s a lie, there are a ton of wrong ways to do it and a ton-plus-one wrong ways to do it if you’re in Texas.

Chili can be made to suit anyone. Some of the best chili I have ever had was vegetarian. Conversely you can make it with any kind or cut of meat. It can be gluten-free, lactose-free, sugar-free. I’ve had it with freeze dried coffee and cumin mixed in (delicious!) and once with orange juice (that was one of the wrong ways).

Anyone can make chili and look like a culinary genius. It is very adaptable and flexible. Add some cocoa or Balsamic vinegar to it and bring it to your holiday party. If you want to impress a special girl try that coffee and cumin trick (you’re welcome).

Chili smells great as it simmers all day and fills your home with the aroma of melding chilis and tomatoes and onions. It’s the perfect way to warm up after being outside in the cold winter wind. ...Except here in Southern California where it’s a ridiculous 95*… sigh

**The Blender:** Edwin Wilke founded Wilke Pipe in New York City in 1872. Not having any sons, Edwin taught his two daughters everything he knew about pipe making and tobacco blending. Anna and Louisa took over the store in 1930. The sisters developed a reputation for excellence in tobacco blends and unsurpassed quality in pipe manufacture. They ran it until 1983 when they sold it to Elliot Nachwalter and Carole Burns who eventually moved the store to Montpelier, VT. John Brandt bought Wilke Tobacco in July of 2017 where he has continued the tradition of superior tobacco blends and has even brought back some long ago forgotten Wilke Blends.

**The Blend:** Wilke No. 191

**The Tin:** Wilke Pipe Tobaccos are sold in bulk and distributed in re-sealable plastic bags. These are not your mother’s sandwich bags.

**The Tobacco:** This is a dark, ribbon cut tobacco. Three different Black Cavendishes, some Kentucky Burley and a very light touch of Virginias. It is a moist tobacco and could use a half an hour of Los Angeles Winter to dry. (so maybe forty-five minutes in a blast furnace) 

**Upon Opening:**  Smooth. honeyed vanilla right up front and in your sniffer. Natural Vermont honey has none of that tonk that indicate a store bought brand. The vanilla is more like vanilla bean than vanilla extract. It’s earthy and robust, dovetailing seamlessly into the Cavendish aroma.

**The Smoke:** I don’t like Burleys in the same way that a lot of guys don’t like aromatics, they are too cigar-like for me. But just as I am trying to demonstrate with this series of reviews that there are aromatics that will appeal to people who didn’t think they liked aromatics, there are Burleys that appeal to me where I didn’t think I liked Burleys; this is one of them. Despite it being almost entirely Cavendishes, this is a very Burley forward blend. The honey clings to the Burley and tempers it’s sweet nuttiness. Just as the vanilla melds with the Cavendishes and sits back letting the Burley take center stage. The Virginias are deep and woody, with no grass or hay notes. Prepare for a fairly standard re-light and tamp routine but you shouldn’t get any gurgle. There’s enough nicotine to massage your temples and you’ll feel it if you get too enthusiastic.

**Conclusion:** This is a really solid tobacco blend with natural casings and I’m excited to introduce a quality aromatic to Burley fans. Maybe it’ll broaden some aromatic smokers to enjoy Burleys more. Keep in mind that it *IS* still a Burley blend and the room note, though mild, may not be as welcome an experience to others as it is to you. It doesn’t get much more quintessentially mom & pop traditional than Wilke Tobaccos and their 145 year history.

**Strength:** Medium  2/4	**Room:** Medium 2/4	**Taste:** Medium 2/4	**Overall:** 3/4

**Reviewers note:**  If it ain’t got /u/antiwittgenstein in it, it ain’t chili, even in Texas.

====================================
aelmer2821: Solid review. I tend to shy away from aros because I like my earthy dirty gritty things. However, I may throw an ounce on my next P&C order. Also, aside from chili, what do you suggest to pair with it?

AdamantFinn: Thank you. I prefer earthy, too and I think you will find this blend ticks several more boxes for you than traditional aromatics do.

As for pairing, 191 could go equally well with coffee in the morning or a Winter Lager in the evening. It's robust enough to stand up with a scotch or bourbon - neat of course.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for another funny, informative review. I've not had any Burley aromatic cross over blends and not really thought about that. Plenty of aros *use* burley, but that isn't quite the same thing.

As a native Texan I have very strong thoughts on Chili. When I tell the Yanks here that you aren't supposed to put beans in Chili they look at me like I've got a screw loose. But the ones that have tasted mine haven seen the light.

AdamantFinn: Hahahahaha. Lots of coincidences around this one. I had no idea that you are from Texas. I also had no idea that my neighbors were making chili and invited me over right in the middle of writing this review!
