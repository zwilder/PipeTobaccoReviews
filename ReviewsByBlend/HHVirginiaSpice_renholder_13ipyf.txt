[Tobacco Review] Hearth & Home: Virginia Spice
By: renholder

**Blend Name:** Virginia Spice

**Description on Tin:** For the pipe smoker who really enjoys the clean, sweet spiciness of a mixture of matured Virginias, but who wants something a little different. The difference comes from the use of cool-smoking Perique for a bit of plum and pepper.

**Leaf:** Medium brown shag cut.

**Tin Aroma:** Sweet and fruity, with almost a hint of chocolate.

**Taste:** This blend starts off with a nice mild hay flavor typically found in medium Virginia blends. A little ways into the bowl it begins to build a fruity flavor akin to sour fruit and plum, characteristic of its VaPer nature. There is a touch of pepper in this blend to give it some spice but it certainly is not a spicy blend. Overall it is on the medium level in regards to overall flavor profile.


**Smokability:** Cool, dry, and steady, this is a very easy VaPer to smoke. No tongue bite either.

**Room Note:** pleasant - neutral. 

**Thoughts:** H&H makes a lot of good, middle of the road blends and this is just another example of a well balanced VaPer.

**Recommend to:** English/Oriental/Balkan lovers. Also people trying to find a nice english blend to try out.

**Summary:** A medium classic VaPer with a nice sour fruit flavor and great smoking qualities.

**My Background:** Iâ€™m a fan of the English and straight Virginia styles, with an appreciation for well placed burleys. I enjoy more complex or stouter blends, and shy away from one sided aromatics.

I really enjoy reviewing tobacco, and would love to hear back about what I can improve on and what you like about them. Thanks for reading!

HalfCap: I picked some of this up a while back to fill out an order for free shipping. I ended up getting a whole bunch more. It's a really easy smoking blend you don't have to think about a lot, if that makes any sense. 

Good review!

BarkingLeopard: Love this tobac.  H&H Anniversary Kake isn't bad either, and there are a ton more.  Tough to go horribly wrong with H&H in my experience.
