Tobacco Review How-To [Review Review]
By: Mordenkrad
---
This subreddit's format for reviewing tobacco is solid, but I feel like it is poorly explained and somewhat confusing to our newer but eager members. The goal of this post is to better explain the content expected in your reviews. Note: reviews are a personal thing, and you need not include everything or anything I say here provided you follow our basic category format. 

**Blend Name:** Name the manufacturer of the blend and the blend's name here. 

**Description on Tin:** Most tins include a short blurb about their contents. For those that don't include this information or tobaccos that have no packaging at all (read as: Bulk) feel free to just include a, "N/A"

**Leaf:** Explain the cut of the tobacco (ribbon, shag, cube, crumblecake, etc.) and the leaf composition. Is the blend made up of golden virginia and burley? Write it here. Black Cavendish and a cherry casing? This is the place to list that.

**Tin Aroma:** What does your unsmoked tobacco smell like? Write it down in this category. Taste and smell are subjective, so don't be afraid, just tell us what you think.

**Taste:** What does your tobacco taste like? Mention how this flavor is through all the stages of your smoke from the lighting to mid bowl and down to the very bottom of the bowl. Many tobaccos change in flavor as you smoke them and that's the kind of information we like to hear. Another optional mention is how the tobacco tastes when it is retrohaled (exhaled through the nose rather than the mouth). 

**Smokability:** This is the place to mention your drying time, packing method, and overall smoking experience. You can also mention the pipe or pipes used in your review process here. Did your blend not want to stay lit? Tell us. Additionally, you may want to mention whether or not the blend burns hot or causes tongue bite. Finally, make a mention of the nicotine content (if you noticed any). 

**Room Note:** What does this blend smell like in the room you're smoking it in? Don't be afraid to leave this field with an, "N/A," if you smoked outside or in an open space. Also, consider seeking outside help with this portion; a non-smoker's perspective is valuable here.

**Thoughts:** This is for you to tell us what YOU think about the blend. Do you like it? Would you buy more of it? What didn't you care for? What would you change about it? How does it compare to other blends? This field gives you the most freedom in the format.

**Recommend to:** Who do you think this smoke would please? Entirely subjective and up to you.

**Summary:** Summarize the entire thing; break it down for us. Take everything you've written and condense it in 2 sentences at a maximum.

**My Background:** Take this opportunity to explain how long you've been smoking and what blends you enjoy.

pylorns: I don't see this as such a big deal, I always felt like this was the starting point, add/edit your own notes as you see fit... just try to keep the primary items.

Mordenkrad: You're right. Absolutely. 

This little guide isn't the end-all be all; I thought some of our new reviewers may like an easy point of reference on what to include in their reviews.

akkozen: Hi, this is a great thing all around, however I would add at least one picture of the tin and of the tobacco itself.

Mordenkrad: I have no qualms with changing the order of the categories personally, but I think this format is set up chronologically rather than logically. First things first you look at the name, then the tin, then what's inside, then you smell it, then you smoke (taste) it, then you smell the room note


And finally you're formulating all your thoughts. In that context I think the current order works well.


Age is a category that could be added for sure probably right after "leaf". 

The family (blend type) should be right after name in my opinion.
