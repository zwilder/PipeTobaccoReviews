[Review] G.L. Pease's Sextant
By: xDemagog

====================================
xDemagog: *Normally Pease blends come with sticker on the bottom designating when they were tinned, this one had no such sticker but upon opening I was greeted by flakes with nice white streaks. Very good sign considering the first run was in 2011.*

**Tin Note**

Sweet sweet Latakia, but not cloying. Smells natural when compared to Latakia blends with sweet cavendish or aromatic topping (looking at you Plumcake). 

**Pipe**

Reddit 2013 Savinelli Canadian

**Paired With**

Nottingham Brewery's Centurion ND Porter

**Tasting notes**

Sweet dark rum

Sweet grass

Dry hay

Bourbon barrel wood chips

Light hickory

Black peppercorn

Cardamom

Christmas pudding

Puerto Rican moonshine (don't ask...alright, go on)

**Smoking Notes**

Immediately greeted by a sweet and muted Latakia. Reminds me of FM Cellar but far more rustic. The sweetness of the rum is very distinct, but it never overpowers the already gentle Latakia. The Latakia is especially present on the back of the tongue and makes this a blend suitable for any season. A little French inhale provides a wonderful Latakia smell. Pease says it isn't an aromatic, so I wonder what his method is with this tobacco, maybe some kind of natural fruit additive. Retro hale is full of dark rum and cardamom. I would recommend maybe dumping the ash before relights, the ash taste comes through. The latter portion of the bowl the sweetness takes a bit of a backseat to tobacco. I feel like this is the Haddos Delight of Pease's Latakia offerings. The nicotine crept up about 2/3s in, which made me long for a sweet coffee but being 10:30 at night...not gonna happen. The BBQ/bourbon chip/hickory notes start to pull through at about 3/4s of the bowl. Last relight is all Latakia and Kentucky and it's lovely.

**Final thoughts**

A blend perfect for a cool summer night at a BBQ that ran too late or warm winter afternoon with a strong coffee, but really this blend is probably best left for ye olde New England autumns. I would best enjoy this blend with a strong cider after apple picking, a sleepy post-Thanksgiving-dessert smoke in the basement with the cigar smokers or just a beautiful smoke through the rustling leaves in the late autumn afternoon. I suggest pairing Sextant with a nice porter or a tasty brown ale, nothing too heavy but flavorful and easy to drink, just like the blend itself. A porter will probably compliment the sweet rum notes while a brown ale will compliment the darker Latakia. 

***Full Disclosure:*** *I'm not a huge fan of Latakia blends but I've come back around to them. I really enjoyed McClelland's Bombay Extra in the past and Drew Estates Meat Pie turned me back on to them. I cracked this tin to give it a try and because it would be an easy trade here in England. I'll be jarring the rest of it. I also enjoy my pipes with ales because I find beer is easier to compliment my tobacco with than most other drinks, and whisky can be too caustic to the taste buds.*


**Overall: 4.6/5** ^^^(Pretty fuckin good)

chewsyourownadv: Nice review! Pretty much reflects my thoughts on it.

> Pease says it isn't an aromatic, so I wonder what his method is with this tobacco, maybe some kind of natural fruit additive. 

This is one of those cases where I think the attempt to distinguish between aromatic and non-aromatic gets a little silly. Sextant definitely has a rum topping; its room note is probably not all that great for others, so perhaps for that reason it is not considered to be an aromatic... but, yes, it's definitely flavored with rum.

Are you going to give Sextant's sibling blend, Navigator, a shot? I thought it was nice to try them side by side, and ended up settling on Sextant, but I think it's time to revisit Navigator.

Ya know, I was using aromatic as interchangeable with cavendish in my head, so you're absolutely right. It definitely isn't an aromatic in proper sense of the word. I'm still curious as to how the tobacco ends up being so sweet. 

I'd have to procure some Navigator, which may be hard in England (and the one place I know who carries Pease sells the tins for Â£20.50, which is pretty much $32). The description makes me want to give it a go though, sounds tasty.

For my part, I think it's a combination of the rum and dark fired Kentucky. Heck, writing that, I figured I might as well look it up. [Here's what Pease says](http://www.glpease.com/Tobacco/OldLondon/):

> ... the infusion of dark rum, and the addition of fire-cured Kentucky, especially when combined with the pressing and fermentation that occurs as a result, give it a unique sweetness and aroma. 

Also, you might be interested in [his thoughts on toppings](http://www.glpease.com/FAQ.html#MYTHS). TL;DR version is that almost all tobacco is topped with something, even if it's just a mostly flavorless sugaring to make the btobacco sweeter.

Mordenkrad: Yeah, people who get weird about their tobacco being "all natural" have no idea what they're talking about. Most of the best blends are topped or otherwise altered for the better. It's kind of like bad CG, we only notice it when it's bad (I'm looking at you, Spinnaker). 
--
chewsyourownadv: It can be really surprising to read the actual ingredients used in what seems like a simple, straight blend. With few exceptions, there's always something else that goes into it that ain't tobacco.

The only exception I can think of is Tabac Manil's Semois. As far as I know, the only thing you get in the green brick is lightly toasted Semois burley.
--
xDemagog: I know that pretty much all tobacco is cased, I was just curious because he's known for "all natural" style blends and its damn sweet. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Yeah, it's just this one is more topped than his other blends. Probably when you try Navigator you'll see the Kentucky+rum sweetness is a little more apparent.

CaptainDickPuncher: Nice review sounds pretty damned tasty.

====================================
Pipezilla: I haven't tried ANY of the GL Pease blends.
I'm cheating myself.  Keep hearing great things about them...Time for a tobacco order!
