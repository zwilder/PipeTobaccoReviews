[REVIEW]: Of the infamous (or is it famous? I don't know) PENZANCE. (by an amateur)

No clue how to format this... I'm sure it's in the side bar but I can't find it. :/

I just packed a bowl of the Penzance in my new pipe. (A meerschaum line pipe gifted to me by /u/flatticus) I wrote this review in a thread about the awesome trade I did with him. And since you guys are always asking for more reviews...

For the record: I've never tried to review tobacco before, but here goes:

**INITIAL THOUGHTS**

Opening the baggie I was hit with the pleasant aroma of tobacco. No slim jim, no flowers, no caramel... just tobacco. Which was interesting. Pleasant interesting.

**TASTE**

It's an English, but not like the English blends I'm used to. The latakia is less pronounced. Definitely still there, but not the barbecue beef thing.

I'm having trouble finding anything that sticks out at me flavor-wise. It's not fruity, or floral, or smoky, or spicy, or anything really. It's definitely not laking in flavor. It's just that the flavor isn't anything specific. If it were a food it'd be an avocado. Rich and buttery and savory. Fancy, but not dainty or delicate. Textural more than flavorful (if that makes any sense).

About 3/4 of the way through I got hints of a melting plastic taste (for lack of a better term.) It wasn't pleasant, but it wasn't a game ender either. And it only lasted a few puffs. I let the pipe sit for a second while I topped off my bourbon glass and when I relit it was gone.

**WIFE RATING***

The "room note" is horrible. My wife was not happy with this one. I never get to smoke indoors anyway. But she quickly left the back porch when I lit up. Her description: "Ugh... how could you like that?"  The smell never once bothered me the smoker. If anything, the nose enhanced the subtleties of flavors.

I had to relight a bunch (could've been the new pipe), but it burnt to nothing in the end. Literally nothing. When it wouldn't light anymore I turned the pipe over and out fell gray ash - Nothing else.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

It's one of (if not the best) tobaccos I've smoked to date. Super smooth, flavorful but not a flavor bomb. I'd recommend even you aro lovers pick up some if you have the chance. It's a mouth-feel experience.
====================================
pylorns: Yeah the women folk don't much like the latakia. Penzance is even more unique in the room note department too.

pixeechick: Love me some latakia. Or dsrk fired kentucky. Keep going, OP. Not all ladies reject the smoky leaf.

crimsonrat: That was a good review. I appreciate you sharing this with us, man. What pipe did you smoke it in?

michaelarney: My man! How are your new babies from the pipe show treating you?

The pipe I used is a no name Tanzanian made briar billiard with a meerschaum bowl. Next time I'm gonna try it in that Jody Davis and make notes of the differences.

I know you were in the middle of al that drama (which I still don't understand)... and I'm sure that kinda stuff sucks. Sorry dude! Hope you're doing well. I for one love your idea for a community tasting. Cant wait. Sad flat is gone, but happy soy milk is a mod now!

crimsonrat: They're going good buddy.

Those meer lined ones are great for trying new blends out of. If you put it in that Jody, remember that some of the taste from what you smoked in it last will be in there.
