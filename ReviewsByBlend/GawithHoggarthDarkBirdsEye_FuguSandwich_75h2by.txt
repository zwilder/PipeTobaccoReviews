Gawith Hoggarth Dark Bird's Eye Review

I ordered 4 oz of this stuff from SP, and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite morning "simple smokes".  It's a mix of dark fired Virginia and dark fired Kentucky.  Taste is a bit hard to describe - earthy, slightly sweet, a little tang, reminds me somewhat of Peterson's Irish Flake.  Very strong nic hit, up there with the ropes.  Burn is phenomenal, one of the very few tobaccos that I can honestly say I smoke to the bottom without relights.  Very much a set it and forget it type smoke.  Highly recommend it.
====================================
professor_throway: u/smokeonthewater17 turned me onto this blend as part of a trade. It is fantastic. Simple, strong, flavorful. I think of Old Dark Fired when I smoke it, but having then back to back this blend they really are not too similar. Dark Birdseye  is much more flavorful and potent at the expense of some of the complexity of ODF.

To much for a morning smoke for me, but a great evening pipe.

Occams-shaving-cream: Hmm thanks, this is very relevant to my tastes and I have eyed that one before.  I prefer the high nic full bodied smokes.

LordHector: This is on my wishlist at smokingpipes as I've been on a bit of a G+H kick lately. I enjoyed Kendal dark and still really like Burley and Bright. I ordered some North Star but I found it a bit dry and astringent so I put it in a jar to try again later. I'll pick up a couple oz of the Dark Birds Eye my next order.
