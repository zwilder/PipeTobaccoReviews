Tobacco Review: C&D Old Joe Krantz
By: antiwittgenstein
---
Review #36

**Blend Name:** Ole Joe Krantz

**Description on Tin:** Another Bob Runowski creation for Cornell & Diehl, Old Joe Krantz uses the nuttiness of cubed Burley, the earthy spice of dark Burley, the toasty sweetness of red Virginia and the musty/sweet spice of Perique to create a heady, rich smoke.
 
**Leaf:** Short brown ribbon.

**Tin Aroma:** Sourdough bread, yeasty, raisins.

**Taste:** Nutty bread with a peppery crunch. Like the black bread I used to eat in Germany. Slow to develop. The pepper fades in and out – it has a halo of sweet citrus about it – but the breadiness is constant. Has a slight sour note. Immediately I recognize that this is the Cornell and Diehl taste in its purest form. That nutty-sour-funk which is ever present in all their blends can be sourced back to this blend. A sweetness builds, with some sharper flavors, reminiscent of Virginia. This folds well into the Perique and builds out another dimension to the taste. And that is pretty much it. Once the Virginia comes in, the bowl has hit steady state. It is a toasty – and I use this word sparingly when I describe any blend – tobacco flavor, bready, spicy and just slightly sweet all the way through.

**Nicotine:** If you want to send your brain and body a cease and desist notice, this is your ticket. I am swimming. 4 shots of Bourbon.

**Smokability:** C&D on point – Dry it for a few minutes. Packs and burns with ease.

**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but I am gonna say, cigarettey. 

**Thoughts:** Give me a few minutes to clear my head.

That took awhile. Even after a heavy meal I have only be able to get through a bowl of this in a single sitting once. This is not the kind of morning or mid afternoon smoke to amuse you as you drift aimless through your life. This is the full stop, emergency positions smoke for those days when you run out of Quaaludes, Xanax, and Lithium. It doesn’t matter when you smoke it, it will be the end of your day.

I will nominate Old Joe Krantz as the Flagship Blend for Cornel and Diehl. That faint collection of flavors I notice in all of their blends is the essence of OJK – a bready-burley-nutty-sour-sweet-spicy-funk. Almost as if they make OJK first, then modify it to make everything from Billy Budd to Autumn Evening. It is the quintessential C&D tobacco, and the quintessential old codger Bur-Per blend.

**Similar Tobaccos:** MM Country Gentleman, most of its C&D stablemates, notably Billy Budd and Three Friars

**Summary:** A classic Burley-Perique blend with an absurd amount of raw power.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**+++

====================================
tribial: Always enjoy these, thanks! I have been debating picking this one and Budd up. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! If like a skull-cracking burley blend, both of those will be well worth your while.
--
====================================
Titanio_Blanco: These reviews are great. I really liked C&D Burley flake #1, now I'll be sticking this one in my next order. 
--
None: You are a seasoned piper Sir, to enjoy BF#1. I have chronicled my journey through the BFs on YouTube and although I like #1 much better than #2, 3 and 4 are my favorites. 
--
Titanio_Blanco: I'll check those out, I've heard good things about #3!
--
====================================
Piffyr: Excellent review! I just happened to be smoking a bowl of OJK when I came across it. You know that a review is good when it makes you notice things that you didn't before, as this one did. Well done, sir. Keep 'em coming.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. Glad to be of service.

KanpaiWashi: > It doesn’t matter when you smoke it, it will be the end of your day.

This sounds absolutely accurate.  I have a buddy who **loves** OJK and this is almost exactly how he described its nicotine hit.  9 out of 10, chances are he's got a bowl of it when you catch him smoking.  He says it's really strong, but he can't get enough of it.  
--
None: > but he can't get enough of it. 

That... Well, that makes sense, given the nicotine. 
--
====================================
pixeechick: This one sounds like an interesting treat. I've been enjoying the VaBur blends that have come my way recently. I'll have to keep this one in mind, especially as it isn't too peppery.
--
====================================
ijustreadidontpost: Cornell & Diehl has been my favorite blending house since I first tried Orion's Arrow.  I love your reviews, antiwittgenstein.  Keep up the good work.  The "Thoughts" section had me rolling!

lord_garrett: Three months later and I'm here reading this review because of the 20% off sale at Smokingpipes. The way you're describing OJK makes me think of beer - specifically dark brown ales or porters. I've been really enamored with this brew called Ellie's Brown Ale which has a dark roasty-toasty bread flavor with a tad of sour to it. While I wouldn't call it "spice", the effervescing suds definitely give an equally stimulating mouth feel. The way you talk about this tobacco makes me think (and hope) that OJK could be the tobacco counterpart to that particular style of brew. Would you say that's a farfetched conclusion? (While I doubt you and I have access to the same brews due to geographical reasons, perhaps you've encountered something that could compare. I just chose that one 'cause that's the one I know.)

Also I'm pretty nicotine sensitive, but the flavor you're describing coupled with all the glowing reviews really REALLY leaves me wanting to try this tobacco. Almost tempted to throw a Missouri Meerschaum mini in with my order just to dedicate to smoking through my sample... With my head still attached to my shoulders. Hahah. 

Also, thanks for the review! Really helped in my decision.

antiwittgenstein: Glad to help. I think you might be right - OJK does have that sort of aley sourness combined with a malty sweetness. I am not really experienced enough with pairing smoke and drink, but those seem like pretty good matches. Maybe an imperial Stout? I mean if you really, really want to fall on the floor.

I am also very nicotine sensitive. You can smoke this and not sick up, but you have to be careful. Try to smoke every day to build up your tolerance. I spend 4-5 days ramping up through Va and English blends which pack medium to medium-full punches. Then eat a huge meal and smoke a tiny bowl of this - I use a Dr. Grabow or MM ozark for this. Don't puff it too fast. Stop mid bowl if you ever feel woozy and have some candy to counteract the nicotine. If I can do it, you can do it. Enjoy your new pipe and tobacco!

P.S. I had an MM mini and burned/poked through the bottom in less than 10 smokes. I would pipemud the bottom as soon as possible and try not to stick anything in the bottom of the bowl while it is warm.
--
lord_garrett: You know, that's great advice. I got this little Marxman billiard from a consignment shop and I planned to use it for flakes. Now that I think about it, that might actually be a good rout to go with OJK since you mention Dr. Grabow. I'll prolly just skip the mini. Thanks again!

====================================
GrimClippers11: OJK is my go to blend but I find it tends to burn a little fast.  One of my favorite homebrews is 60% OJK, 30% Irish flake, 3P plug or Jackknife and 10% Navy flake. That will give you plenty of flavor, smoke time and all the vitamin N a growing boy needs
--
antiwittgenstein: Interesting idea. It does burn pretty quickly, but I might go the other way, put it with more Virginia - maybe something funky like Anni Kake or MR, or a less powerful burley, like Classic Burley Kake, Prince Albert, or Carter Hall.
--
GrimClippers11: If you enjoy English blends its great in a 50% OJK, 25-30% English ( I like London Mixture, Esoterica Pembroke, or Squadron leader) and 20-25% Virginia or Aromatic (University flake, haddo's delight or kajun kake)
