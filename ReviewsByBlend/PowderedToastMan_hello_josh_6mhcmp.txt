Review - Powdered toast Man!

**Blend Name:** Powdered Toast Man
 
**Description:** Created by /u/coldsolderjoint & /u/linearone
 
**Leaf:**  Burley and mystery

**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla, maple, dark brown sugar/molasses, cocoa. Something a little lightly pungent/fermented like perique.

**Taste:** First light I get vanilla - something like Lane 1-Q but not all in your face.
After a few puffs the cinnamon comes in. Its sweet and spicy like an atomic fireball candy. Maple (similar to autumn evening) drifts in an out occasionally. Toasty and woody tobacco comes out.
This would be good with coffee. Going to make a cup…
On relight the cinnamon is up front and strong. Goes well with coffee.
I'm not getting anything I would identify as "buttery." I like it quite a bit but I don't think I would describe it as "french toast" if I wasn't looking for that. This may be because I always add nutmeg to my french toast batter. 

**Nicotine:** mild-medium

**Smokability:** Moist out of the tube but probably smoke-able. Should have a few minutes drying time.

**Room Note:** Smells pretty good, toasty vanilla. A non-smoker will probably notice the tobacco smell more than the aromatics.

**Thoughts:** Tasty and flavorful for an aromatic. Tobacco-to-topping flavor balance reminds me of a Gawith Hoggarth aromatic rope - without the strength. You get some honest to goodness tobacco flavor with some nice top notes of vanilla and cinnamon. Sample was greatly appreciated. I'd like to see the recipe and make some more. I think its subtle enough that it could benefit from repeat smokes to really understand it. I've drifted away from aromatics so I really enjoy finding one that tastes good.  

**Similar Tobaccos:** Maybe autumn evening mixed with some burley for body

**Summary:** Flavorful medium-aromatic. Atomic fireball candy meets autumn evening.

**Rating:** 4 out of 5 but I see it going higher with more bowls…
====================================
hello_josh: Thanks for the sample! This was a fun experiment to partake in.

linearone: Thank you for tasting and giving such a thoughtful review!

====================================
SmokeOnTheWater17: Did no one else get a Lakeland like essence from this smoke? 
--
hello_josh: I didn't notice any and I don't have any more left to look for that.
--
linearone: Oh god I hope not... im cleaning my pipe as we speak since i tried a 1/4 bowl of stonehenge...I can promise there is nothing like that in there lol 
--
levins0: I still have no idea what you smoked. I watched you open the damned tin, but I did not get anything like that from Stonehenge. 
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: Me either. No essence in Stonehenge. 
--
levins0: I got the very slightest hint one in a while, which isn't surprising since it's a Gawith blend, but only the very slightest and I had to really try to look for it. 
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: I liked it. Maybe my pipe is ghosted. Hmm maybe... Did I smoke run flake in this one.... 
--
levins0: Not me.

====================================
coldsolderjoint: It's fun to see the different variations in everyone's palette. We settled on the recipe and tried to make the samples the same. 
--
hello_josh: Definitely. It's also fun to revisit blends that I tried way early on when I first started and see how my tastes have changed. My first straight, bright Virginia experiences tasted like ash and cigarette.

Liga_monger16: Where can I get some of this!?

hello_josh: The guys that came up with the blend posted the [recipe here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/6mqbn0/powdered_toast_man_a_reddit_blend_recipe/)


They are also thinking about selling some of it pre-blended for people who don't want to buy the constituent blends to mix themselves. Read about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/6ql877/powdered_toast_man_for_sale/)
