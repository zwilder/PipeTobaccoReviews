**Name:** L.J. Peretti - Crown

**Type:** English

**Leaf:** Virginia, Cavendish, Oriental

**Blender’s Description:** A pleasant English blend of Virginia, Cavendish and Oriental tobaccos. Rich and spicy flavor and slightly aromatic.

**Old Deadhead’s Opinion:** This review is the last of the four samples received in Peretti’s “Hybrid Sampler”, and the first with an actual name! Of the four, this is the blend that took me the longest to warm up to, but I’m glad I decided to stick with it. With regards to pipes, this one seems to really benefit from a slightly wider bowl, and smoked well out of an old Wally Frank Natural Unfinished Canadian with a bowl diameter of about .80. 

[The cut of this is a rough ribbon, very light tans and browns, with some dark specs of Cavendish](https://imgur.com/Wbc4n9g). The tin note is actually fairly sweet, but this doesn’t come through as much in the taste. The initial light greets with just a slightly sweet taste from the Virginias, but is very quickly overcome with the spice of the Orientals. One thing I learned with this one is that it needs to be dried well and sipped to really appreciate the spice of the Orientals without overpowering the tongue. There’s actually a very nice balance here, with Virginias providing just enough sweetness to keep the Oriental in check, and the Cavendish providing a background note that keeps the consistency just right. There’s really very little change as the bowl progresses and, as such, it is a somewhat one-dimensional smoke in that regard. The flavor is spicy, somewhat peppery, but enjoyably so. The nicotine is far from a powerhouse, but there’s enough to certainly satisfy. 

What really comes through for me on this one is the quality of the tobaccos. There is no apparent casing here, just good quality leaf, mixed in the right proportions to be a solid flavor. The more I smoke it, the more I appreciate the subtlety of it. It’s not particularly complex, but is definitely a good “everyman” smoke. I’m actually excited about the idea of using this as a base and adding just a touch of Latakia, probably in the form of some H&H Vintage Syrian. I think that just a bit of smokiness will add a complexity that complements this very high quality blend and make it just a tad more enjoyable. I’ll report back on my finding once I’ve had the opportunity. 

**Summary:** A very high quality blend that could be an all-day smoke. Nothing extremely special, but certainly very satisfying. If you’re interested, I’d start at 2 oz, and see if you agree. 

**3.5/5**

Scale:

5/5: This is Heaven, man!!

4/5: This deserves to be in my regular rotation

3/5: I'd probably revisit this at some point

2/5: Well, that was...interesting

1/5: WTF did I just smoke?

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Its a real testament to some blending houses when you find a blend you just aren't thrilled with but really can't say anything bad about it, just that it isn't your cuppa.
