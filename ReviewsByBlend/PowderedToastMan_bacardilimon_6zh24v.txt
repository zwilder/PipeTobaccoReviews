My PipeTobacco cohorts,


I love PTM! It's a champion blend that that smokes great and smells delicious. I went rock climbing with friends and decided to smoke while taking a break. My two friends loved the smell. One said it reminded him of his father. The other just enjoyed the smell. I only had to relight it once. No bite or hot smoke. It was just relaxing. After climbing I came home and my wife and kids could not smell it on my clothes. I'm currently adding the ingredients to my shopping cart to create more of this great stuff.
