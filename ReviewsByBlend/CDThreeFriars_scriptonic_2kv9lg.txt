[Review] Cornell & Diehl - Three Friars
By: scriptonic
---

====================================
scriptonic: **Blend Name**: Cornell and Diehl – Three Friars

**Description on Tin**: A combination of Virginia ribbon, Brown Virginia Burley and Perique, Three Friars delights with a combination of natural piquant sweetness and spice.

Blend Components: A combination of Virginia ribbon, Brown Virginia Burley and Perique

**Leaf**: Course/Ribbon Cut

Tin Aroma: Citrusy, sweet. Almost has a sweet corn smell. If you ever have made tamales this blend reminds me of that smell when you are steaming them.

**Taste**: Initial tastes: VERY light and sweet. Virginia is King on the initial light. The Taste is somewhat reminiscing of a cactus apple.  About a quarter away through the bowl the burleys and Perique are coming out to play more. The Perique is there but is no way overpowering. The cactus apple-esq taste seems to have all disappeared.  A sweet sourish lemon taste is coming slightly through…my god, this is pretty fantastic sipped. I’m now picking up a fantastic toasted pine nut taste.  The transition seems to be abrupt. It seems like someone flipped a switch and bam there is the burley and Perique. I am currently smoking this is my Peterson D6 Churchwarden, but I have also had a very similar experience with a cob (the burleys were more upfront there) and a clay (the Virginia’s seemed sweeter in the clay for some reason)

The Perique seems to linger in the back of your throat a bit. I'm about 2/3 the way down now, and the retrohale now is all burley. The spice from the Perique seemed to kick into overdrive. If you like Perique, I feel the balance of the blend is just perfect. It’s not enough to make you go grab a glass of milk, but it lets you know it is there. Very well balanced with the sweetness that comes through.


**Smokability**: Needed only a few minutes drying time. But I did get this as a bulk sample that was shipped in a ziplock baggie that was in transit for about 12 days.  Very minimal relights. Probably would have burnt to white ash from the light if I did not have to put It down to type out this review. 

Room Note: Smoked outdoors

**Thoughts:** Superb blend. Utterly fantastic. This is a blend that aging will do wonders, and I fully intend on reporting back in a year and doing a side by side of this. I’ve heard a few people compare this to the original 3 nuns, I have tried some of that blend, but obviously it had quite a bit of age to it. When you do pick up some of this tobacco please do not go into it thinking it is a clone of another blend.  Why more people are not talking about this is beyond me. It is wonderful. I can see myself smoking this on days where you are doing something other than smoking a pipe to relax. It’s a great blend that you don’t need to pay constant attention to enjoy it. I can see myself coming up in winter on the ice fishing with this in my pipe and loving every minute of it.

Side note: Pairs great with a very lightly roasted coffee with a  splash of unsweetened almond milk

**Recommend to**: VaPer lovers.

**Rating**: Five outta five stars.....go get you some of this and hoard it.
