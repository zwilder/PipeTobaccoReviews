Review: Drexel II Pouch and the 15 Dollar Briar

From my recent [mail call](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/5t45lx/mail_call_or_how_1_dollar_at_pc_turned_into/)  
  
So, what the hell is this pouch of Drexel II anyway?  It sounds like a powertool instead of a tobacco.

Now, I got this as part of a 5 for 25 deal, but the current P&C single pouch deal offloads a crappy clay pipe on you for buying a single pouch. So beware of that!  
  
As part of the mail call, I got a 15 dollar random M/T 6mm filter briar.  [P&C Link](https://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/mitchell-thomas-assorted-6mm-filter-pipes-pipes/1505002/)
  
I have to say, **if someone wants a cheap starter briar... this might be their first and last one**. This undercuts the cost of a Walgreens Dr Grabow el-cheapo by 30 dollars and is probably 30 dollars less than a seconds-bucket brick and mortar briar. It draws fine, is featherweight for clenching, and... smokes well.

I broke this pipe in with some Carter Hall the previous evening (not that I think it needed "breaking in").  
  
So Drexel II. **It's a non overly vanilla Virgina-Cavendish aromatic**. It smokes like you would imagine a Lane tobacco would smoke. It came out of the pouch dry enough to pack well, light well, and smoke cool.  
  
Who is this for?  For those of that travel on business often, pouches give us a convenient way to take a smoke with us in case we get a chance to. Peterson Wild Atlantic may not be Frog Morton but it's a great English to travel with. **This is basically 1Q for travel**.     
  
**Drexel seems to be a way to sell a 1Q-alike in a pouch for Drug Stores.** Lane already has umpteen STG drug store brands. Captain Black, Paladin, Velvet, Smoker's Pride, Borkum,  Sail, and Half/Half are all distributed by the same umbrella that gives you Orlik and Escudo.  We get it Lane, you are diversified for recessions and booms.  However, I would probably buy this over all those other drug store varietals you sell. You don't actually list this on your brands page either.
   
**Almost half of aromatics I lump into the "some mix of virginia/black cav with vanilla (and possibly other flavor or bits or burley/perique)" category.** I prefer English to that class I sort of mentally label as "American".  That said, variety is the spice of life and sometimes I don't want Latakia aftertaste for a solid 2 days from having too much.  Drexel was a fine smoke and I could see throwing it in my travel case for some late night smoking.  
  
Final notes. The packaging needs re-working. Redo this in a more elaborate art deco motif. Dark Blue will hide in the shadows on your typical drug store shelf as well.
