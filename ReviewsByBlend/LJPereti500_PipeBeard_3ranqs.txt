Tobacco Review: LJPeretti 500
By: PipeBeard
---
Blend name: 500 by LJ Peretti

Description on tin: A real outdoor man's smoke with plenty of flavor and full strength. A unique blend of Virginia, Havana, and Oriental.

Leaf: Virginia, Havana (cigar leaf), and Oriental. The cigar leaf is chunky cut, the VA is too, and plentiful, and the Oriental is ribbon cut. They say this one is outdoorsy, and it sure looks like it.

Tim aroma: Ridiculous. Very much a natural tobacco aroma. It smells like a perfect blend between "pipe tobacco" and "cigar" (not a burning cigar, but the nutty, sweet, brown, toasty, fresh from the humidor aroma).

Taste: Cigar, but...not. Up front, it's like that bit of the sweet spot of a nice Cuban that comes after the toasting and light, but the VA is there underneath.  Surprisingly, the VA does not add a lot of sweetness. The oriental is there, and in just about as much proportion as this blend needs to add just some spice and smokiness to make it woodsy and campy, but it is not in your face. Mostly cigar.

Smokeability: Easy. Pack it any old way in any old pipe and it's gonna be good.

Roomnote: Cigar.

Mustache note: Cigar and woods

Pair with: Steak.

Thoughts: This isn't one of those new, fancy, incensed cigars. This isn't your gentleman's club, black tie and single malt cigar. This is meat on fire, rustic, old world, working mans cigar. This is cigar like the old Cuban guys who roll cigars would smoke.

Recommend to:  Those who keep asking for good cigar leaf blends. And men with beards.

Summary: As far as cigar leaf blends go, this will be my go to.

Rating: 3.5 stars (would rate a bit higher, but my tastes are more VA and VA/Per than cigar blends, but this one is a home run).

My Background: Been a pipe smoker for a dozen years now. I smoke at least a pipe a day, sometimes three. Like my flair says, I'm a Sam Gawith fanboy, and predominantly favor VA, VA/Per blends, but I don't discriminate too much (Englishes, Balkans, Burleys, and Lakelands are all in my regular rotation).

My top five: Best Brown, Firedance, Gaslight, Stonehaven, Tashkent

Scale:  
5 stars: A Holy Grail.   
4 stars: Does it come in pounds?  
3 stars: Does it come in half pounds?  
2 stars: Two tins: one for now, one to age.   
1 star: I mean, I'll smoke the tin...  
0 stars: Anybody want the rest of this?  
-1 star: Trade with my enemies.   
-2 stars: Wouldn't wish on my enemies.   
-3 stars: "Flush these pipes turds!"

====================================
pixeechick: Thanks for the review! I'm not much of a cigar smoker (they get too hot for me), but this sounds like it could very much be an enjoyable experience. I'll keep this in mind if I ever decide to smoke cigar leaf in a pipe. 

That in mind, how's the ghost?

CaptainDickPuncher: If your cigar gets too hot you're probably smoking it too fast. You really only take a puff every 45 seconds or soon a cigar. You have to smoke it much slower than a pipe.
--
pixeechick: Noted. Most of the trouble is near the end;but yeah, I could probably slow down. 
--
CaptainDickPuncher: It's a very common mistake. Also some cigars just turn hot and bitter towards the end so it could be that.
--
PipeBeard: Interestingly enough, the ghost is not heavy on the cigar note. It's in there, but about as much as the VA.
