**Blend Name:** Sutliff Pumpkin Spice

**Description on Tin:** From Pipes&Cigars website: Sutliff's Pumpkin Spice is a mellow blend of Burley, Virginia and black Cavendish that's imbued with the flavors of pumpkin and the spices that usually accompany it. This is a comforting, warm blend that can be enjoyed all day long.

**Leaf:**  Black Cavendish, Burley, Virginia

**Tin Aroma:** Pumpkin, vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon - the tin note is much stronger than the room note and taste.

**Taste:** pumpkin, nutmeg, vanilla, allspice

**Smokability:** Does not need drying, will light right away.  Buuuut.  I would recommend around 10-25 minutes to dry out and not much longer.

**Room Note:** Very pleasant, vanilla and slight hint of pumpkin.

**Thoughts:** If you are familiar with wines that have higher acidic to them or more sugar can sometimes be called "dry' I'd say I get the same feeling when smoking this.  You get this feeling when you rub your tongue to the roof of your mouth and its kinda gravely is the best description.  No tongue bite, and the after taste in the mouth is slightly nutmeg and a hint of pumpkin.  retro-haling gives you the full flavor of this, which I have to say is on the fainter side, but enough to be enjoyable.  

**Recommend to:** Aromatic Smokers for sure, great fall smoke.

**Summary:** Smoked this in my Stanwell 172 with filter, Stanwell Duke Lovat (unfiltered) and clay pipe to get pure tobacco taste.

**My Background:** Certified Tobacconist Apprentice.  I've been smoking a pipe since college for 17 years now.  I will smoke anything from aromatic to english to vapors and find myself enjoying a sweet burley or a good virginia flake more often than not.  I will confess I do love my aromatics tongue bite and all.

gatton: Great review. I will add a small bag of this to my next P&C order. I am in love with fall scents/foods so I'll puff on this with some pumpkin spice coffee. 

Glad to hear someone else extolling the virtues of a nice burley. I love the nutty stuff.
