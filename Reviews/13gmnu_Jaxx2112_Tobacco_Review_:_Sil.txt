Tobacco Review : Sillem's Black
By: Jaxx2112
---
**Blend Name:** Sillem’s Black

**Description on Tin:** Extravagant is the right word to characterize this mixture. We have revolutionized the traditional old English art of blending. The main ingredient is the finest spicy smoky Latakia. By adding highly aromatic Black Cavendish, this blend becomes smoother. A small portion of Burley gives a slight toasted aroma, and a pinch of bright Virginia brings a subtle sweet note. Mellow, but yet full-bodied aromas of honey and fruit essences result in a unique flavor. This tobacco will surely be a delight.

**Presentation/Leaf/Cut:**   The tobacco arrives in a gorgeous black 100g tin embedded with a Hanse’s anchor cross with a blue gem in the middle.  Simply put, it is an elegant, crisp and modern take on tin art design.  The tobacco itself is dark, very dark.  Splashes of light brown from the burley and virginia help keep this blend from being pitch black.  Considering the blend is comprised of Burley, Virginia, Cavendish and Latakia, it’s safe to say that the majority of the blend (by sight alone), is Lat and Cav.  The tobacco is in a ribbon cut, with slightly larger leafier cuts of burley blended in.  The tobacco arrived a little moist, but dried out very quickly.  If humectants are used in this blend, i’d be very surprised.  Considering the tin itself does not provide a very good seal after breaking the vacuum and the tobacco dries out quickly, i’d suggest moving this to a mason jar ASAP.

**Tin Aroma:**  When you first open the tin, prepare to be overwhelmed.  It’s not necessarily an unpleasant odor, it’s just very “in-your-face”, and will catch you by surprise.  Going in for the second, gentler wiff, you get sweetness and that distinct latakia odor.  The tin is sweet in the floral sense, but not necessarily artificial or berrylike.  It actually reminds me of floral potpourri the most.  It is quite pleasant and not cloy.  Overall the tin note is latakia heavy with floral notes with no detectable burley or virginia scent.

**Taste:**  The charring light is deceptive.  Initial tastes of sweetness juxtaposed with the punchy tangy/tartness of the syrian latakia make this tobacco very promising.  After a few minutes, that initial sweetness dies down and you’re left with a pretty heavy latakia blend with notes of oak, tartness and light sweetness.  I cannot detect the burley in this blend, although I’m going to have to guess that it’s purpose is to facilitate smoke generation and add a more body to the smoke.  I do not get the honey/fruit aspect the tin pitches either.  The bowl ended heavy on the tart/sour aspect with a bit of virginia sweetness barely poking its head.  Every few puffs you would be granted with a sour/sweet mix, but the majority of the blend smoked latakia heavy.

**Room Note:**  The room note is decidedly floral, with smokey notes and oak.  It is pleasant, however not as pleasant or sweet as most aromatics.  While i don’t think you would be winning people over with this room note, I doubt you’d be losing them either.  I’ve only smoked this blend outdoors, so i cannot comment on the lingering scent.

**Smokability:**  After a light drying session, the tobacco burns to a relatively fine ash with small specks of dottle.  The blend takes well to fire, and I had no issue with the blend going out randomly.  The smoke itself was a mix between heavy plumes of smoke and mild wisps, it felt rather erratic and not very consistent.  I feel a bit more burley could have evened this out and made for a more consistent smoke.  As far as bite goes, I didn’t detect any, but i’m sure extreme puffing or windy conditions could make it worse.  Finally, having smoked this on an empty stomach in the morning, i can conclude that it’s nic hit is relatively weak.

**Thoughts:** I can see why people like this blend.  It’s an interesting foray into the aro-english genre that doesn’t get a whole lot of support.  Personally?  I’m not too crazy about it.  I’ve never been a huge latakia fan to begin with, so this blend hit me as lat heavy with a splash of sweetness.  It didn’t explore the potential of the aro-english by employing unique toppings, or attempting to marry the various tobaccos with the topping.   Instead of complimenting the topping or other tobaccos, i felt that the latakia was just too heavy and overwhelmed the delicate nature of the virginia and smothered the sweetness of the cavendish.  While the sweetness and virginia were present in the blend, they were fleeting in the flavor department.
 
**Smoked In:** London made basket briar with a 6/8’’ bore, MM Country Gent with 6/8’’ bore and a Meerschaum pipe with a 5/8’’ bore.  Of the three, the narrower Meerschaum made the latakia stand out more and left me with a punchy lat blend with almost no sweetness.  This is likely due to the smaller bowl size.  What i can say is that of the three, the Briar is a much larger pipe and I found myself getting tired of the taste before i reached the halfway point.  I would consider this a dessert smoke, one that is I found myself easily fatigued by.

**Fire Used:**  Angled flame Tsubota Pearl Eddie (old boy style) lighter.  Matches.  No discernable difference in ember retention or taste.

**Recommend to:** Aromatic Smokers looking to branch out into Aro-English blends or even to get an experience in what latakia is.  Lat lovers looking for an aromatic with a good solid tobacco taste and a pleasant room note may also find Sillem’s Black enjoyable.

**Summary:**  Again, I really can understand why people like this blend.  It’s a latakia heavy attempt at an aromatic and it is successful in that respect.  The roomnote is floral and fragrant, but not necessarily unpleasant.  The blend takes to fire easily and has initial notes of the characteristic latakia smokiness, oak, tangy/tartness mixed with a very mild sweetness from the virginia and the cavendish.  After some time, the sweetness fades and you are left with a simple latakia blend that doesn’t really progress much.  Sometimes the blend components come back forward, but most of the time you are left with just latakia, which left a lot to be desired.  When the flavours worked together in harmony, the blend was fantastic, but those moments were few and far between.  For my tastes, i’d give this blend a 2.5/5.  I’ll smoke the rest of it, but I did not enjoy how lat heavy it was.


**Would I buy a pound of it?:**  Personally, I dislike the amount of latakia present-- so I will finish the remaining 50g of my tin and bid Sillem’s Black farewell.

**Value:**  At $15.28 a 100g tin online ($4.33 an ounce), it’s not the cheapest tobacco out there, but it is still cheaper than Dunhill blends for a similarly quality blend.

**My Background:** I’ve been a pipe smoker since 2010.  I’ve run the gamut between styles and have settled (for now) on Virginias, VaPers, Aro-English and Burley blends.  I’m not terribly fond of heavy Latakia blends, however I do enjoy it on occasion.  My staples as of this review are LJ Peretti’s Park Square, Hal O the Wynd, Carter Hall and Peter Stokkebye’s Luxury Twist.

Do_what93: Have you ever had Boswell's Northwoods?  How would you compare them?

Jaxx2112: Sadly I can't say I've had any of the Boswell's blends yet.  Hopefully someone else can chime in for me.

====================================
insidioustact: Hey, I have Sillem's Black! I got it about 2 years ago, tried it and didn't like it and locked it up in a mason jar... You inspired me so I tried some in my meer. I was hesitant to do so, because I remember it ghosting very very badly. It ghosted a briar and a cob for a very long time, had to do the old everclear and salt trick and smoke the rest of it out. 

It was better than I remember, but it was just alright still. Not sure how often I'll smoke this one. 
--
Jaxx2112: Glad to hear you pulled it out of the cellar to give it a go.  I felt the same way after a year, better than when i first got it, but still leaving a lot to be desired.  In the meantime, i'm going to try and smoke a bowl or so every 2 weeks to weed down the remnants and free this jar up!
