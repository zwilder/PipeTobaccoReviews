GH&Co. Dark Plug.. I think I just lost a fight.

Another spectacular sample sent by /u/Bonehed.. each one kicking my ass harder and faster. By the grace of this community and out of pure luck my allergies cleared up, nose stopped dripping, no more head spins just in time before the storm clouds came rolling in and I dun goofed. 

This stuff smells like it was going to beat me up and it sure as hell did. Smokey sweetness just pours into your nose Mmm Mmm good. I filled up my small Vuillard canadian thinking *oh it's just a small little bowl I can't get too loopy now can I?* Wrong, oh how wrong I was. I prepared this by slicing up some very thin flakes almost shag like when I partially rubbed it out, stuffed it in, then lit up.

On the initial light I quickly tapped gloves with the famous lakeland flavours and went back to my corner ready to start our bout. I went in guns blazing and **BAM** took a left hook to the noggin as I retrohaled too soon and didn't let the ember settle, as quick as I went in I was in tears due to not paying attention. After I came back to my senses I trudged forward and took a few swings. A dark charred meaty flavor came in almost like you left the beef on too long and came back to leathery jerky. This blend was very elusive it went out quite frequently even while dried it damn near finished my match book trying to get it going. Once it did though **KA-Pow** an uppercut to the jaw had my head swimming through a sea of blur.

I felt like I was in a handicap match the Virginia's and Burley's took turns coming out and showing me what they had to offer. Deep hay notes with a tinge of acidity came and went along with the savory meat. My bell got rung and we went back to our corners, bruised and battered I was hurting.. I thought just maybe I tired Dark Plug out and he was going to go easy on me. Nope. There were no more surprise flavors smacking me around but it's Nic Hits got harder as I tried knocking him down, I was slumped in my chair by now barely conscious. I had a full belly as I've just finished dinner and was scared, but I got him right in the bread basket and perked back up after a few more minutes just in time for the third and final round.

Finishing up I got knocked in the temples out of no where and starting feeling rather sleepy I decided enough was enough and just laid there on the mat waiting to get dragged out in a stretcher, I have lost but damn was that a good one.. I welcome a rematch any day. The flavors really deepen and meld together at the last moment but get pretty intense nicotine wise. I loved it, Bonehed really must like his battles with these blends.

TLDR; This blend has a charred meat/Jerky like flavor with a deep hay note throughout, the nicotine will blast you away if you smoke too much and you should proceed with caution. This blend is no joke full bodied goodness.
====================================
tennesseean_87: Sounds good. Scented or unscented?
--
BWeice: I really couldn't tell you, I am unfamiliar with all lakelands until just recently. How would I distinguish the difference?
--
bonehed: It is unscented though I think it's cross-contaminated a bit by proximity and/or machinery. I've not had the scented but I'd imagine there would be no mistaking the essence's presence in that version. I *barely* taste it in the unscented and it usually dissipates in a moment or two...

BWeice: It was very subtle but i'll need to train myself before another beatdown
--
tennesseean_87: Does it taste like plain tobacco or like it has fruity/floral/spicy/herbal topping added?
--
BWeice: Well from the man himself said it was unscented but I personally had an herbal taste, it was an unfamiliar slightly sweet and bitter taste but very subtle and at random points.
--
Alligator_Gar: I've got three plugs of it after BH introduced me to it. All unscented GH tastes scented to me, but I don't mind Geraniums, so it's all good.

====================================
C-Ray6: Oh mylanta this is my new favorite (unscented). /u/slamfrankel sent me some and I need more!
--
Slamfrankel: /u/Bonehed actually turned me onto this plug too actaully. What an awesome and small community 
--
C-Ray6: It's heavenly

antiwittgenstein: Well written man, got me giggling and teetering on my seat. One of the more literary reviews I have seen up here - or anywhere really.

Make sure you go back and flair this as a review, you might not have meant it that way, but it sure tells the tobacco's story.

BWeice: Glad you enjoyed it haha, this stuff does strange things with your head.
