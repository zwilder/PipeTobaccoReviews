Review - JackKnife Plug

**Blend Name:** JackKnife Plug (GL Pease)  
**Description on website:** JackKnife Plug is an all natural blend of dark-fired Kentucky leaf, and ripe, red Virginia tobaccos, layered on a central core of golden flue-cured leaf, providing deep, earthy flavors with a hint of bright sweetness.  
**Leaf & Prep:** Plug.  Dark, Dense, brownie-looking plug.  I cut into relatively thick flakes and rub out a bit.  Blend contains Dark Fired Kentucky, red Virginias, and golden Flue-Cured.  
**Tin Aroma:** Dark, Heavy, Leathers, Forest-floor.  
**Taste:** Oh man, this is dark and deep and woodsy.  Leathery flavors with deep umami bass notes.  The reds and the goldens balance those bass notes well and allow them to really punch.  
**Smokability:** Lights and burns well.  In my experience there is no need for drying.  
**Room Note:** Don't even think about lighting this up in the house.  You will not be appreciated for doing so.  I enjoy the smell while smoking outside but it is nothing but deep hearty tobaccos.  
**Thoughts:** The first light can be grizzled and wild, but then it settles into something deep and comforting.  Perfect for around a campfire or on a cold autumn or winter day.  The nicotine is powerful.  Some blends I am tempted to inhale a puff or two to increase the buzz a bit.  Not this one.  Smoking slowly you get a woodsy leathery sense.  If you smoke a bit hotter you get umami and spice.  I suggest smoking in a smaller pipe, or packing partial bowls.  Otherwise, I suggest you find a comfy place to sit and smoke slowly.  
I really like this stuff.  My tin is a bit over a year old, and I'll be buying and putting a few more in the closet for safe keeping.  
**Recommend to:** For those that like their coffee black, whisky neat, and intimate encounters rough.  
**My Background:** I smoke mostly Virginias, VaPers and Latakia blends, but I'm a relatively infrequent smoker and do not have pounds/kilos of tobaccos put through my pipes.
====================================

antiwittgenstein: I have been on the cusp of ordering this one for awhile now. I think your review pushed me over the edge. So thanks? 

Is it similar to any other blends you have had? Is there any noticeable pepper from the dark fired?

claypainter: I don't have experience with any similar blends, but I haven't ventured into such dark-fired forward blends. I'm sure others could point you to similar blends.

There is noticeable pepper and spice, but for me it only really comes to the forefront when I puff a bit more aggressively.

====================================
SMIDSY: JKP is the "heavy" tobacco in my rotation. He is not kidding about the nicotine punch. I smoked a 3/4 bowl of it in one sitting and I was totally out of commission for 2 hours. Small bowls, however, work quite well as you get the nicotine buzz after just a short smoke.


Extremely flavorful and fun to prepare. Will be buying more once I run out.
