**Blend Name:** Sutliff Private Stock Great Outdoors

**Description on Tin:** Quality Pipe Tobacco

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish, Burley

**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla, faint licorice, anise, very strong anisette/absinthe flavor. Hint of nuttiness. 

**Taste:** Vanilla, honey, light hay, toffee. A pile of leaves with a vanilla candle burning. A little moistness, better if left to dry for a little while. Very pleasant lightly aromatic flavor. Can taste hints of the tobacco even though it's an aromatic. 

**Strength and Nicotine:** Negligible in both departments. Not much there at all.

**Smokeability:** Very smokeable. After cracking the tin, I let the tobacco dry on a paper towel for a couple of hours before smoking it. Much drier than Molto Dolce, the aromatic I reviewed a few days ago. It's a krumble kake type of texture, and the taste is very smooth. 

**Room Note:** True to the name, I smoked this blend outside while I was carving a pumpkin. So I can't speak to the room note. However, it is an aromatic and has a pleasant taste when smoked, so I believe it would have a pleasant room note. I smoked this blend a few years ago when I started smoking a pipe, and I believe I liked the room note then. But it's all conjecture at this point.

**Thoughts:** Nothing that wows you in terms of flavor, just generally an exceedingly mild and neutral tobacco. Nothing offensive either or any harsh notes. Mildly aromatic and non-offensive. Firmly average.

**Recommend to:** An aromatic smoker that maybe wants a little bit more of the tobacco flavor. Not that there's much here, but it's less of a goopy, Yankee Candle-like tobacco that something like Molto Dolce is. Maybe a beginning aromatic smoker that wants to (very) slowly transition away from aromatics.

**Summary:** A very non-offensive and pleasant blend that won't wow you and won't disgust you. Give it a try if you want something with a nice room note but isn't a super goopy aro. Don't try it if you want something that will absolutely blow you away with flavor.

**My Background:** Iâ€™ve been smoking for nearly three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). Not usually an aromatic smoker at all. 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a couple weeks ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and received six tins of Sutliff Private Stock in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is the second of many that I'll be doing as part of the program!
====================================
blenheim45: I would say this is "damning with faint praise" but that really isn't true.  There is a place for this type of blend, whether for those of us who find the need for a lighter more socially acceptable room note (certainly more so than my typically Latakia laden blends) or those transitioning from the candy store to the tobacco store.

I would be much more likely to smoke and enjoy this than Molto Dolce as for an example.  thanks for taking one for the team. LOL

tochrais: I think I'd probably really like this one. I smoke my pipes indoors but the latakia blends I've been enjoying lately upset my housemates (wife and cats). This kind of blend will be great in the colder months ahead. Thanks for the review!
