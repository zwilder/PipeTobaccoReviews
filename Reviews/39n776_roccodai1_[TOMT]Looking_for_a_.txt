[TOMT]Looking for a pipe review/pipe smoking reason video on Youtube

Hello everyone at /r/PipeTobacco, I had been thinking for a few months about trying to smoke a pipe for relaxation, and, one of the videos that had a favorable effect on me was of a guy making a video of why he smokes pipes on Youtube. Since there are so many pipe-smokers here I had wanted to ask if anyone had come across it.
He was smoking it in his backyard, before walking to work through his yard or garden and then through a wooded area. The guy had a slight mustache and a beard, and may have been wearing a beanie cap. He may have been Canadian, but not sure about that.  
Somewhere at the end of the video, he looks around the woods, takes a puff of his pipe and says " I am blessed"

I saw it a couple months ago and have not been able to find it since. 

I plan to show it to my wife, whose a little about me starting this hobby. 


Anyway, if any of you know what it was please let me know. 

Thanks and you all have a great weekend !!

bob_12: That was [NWPipeSmoker](https://www.youtube.com/user/NWPipeSmoker/) on Youtube, real name Tom, and he has the best and most relaxing videos in the pipe community. He seems like such a great guy and he exemplifies the idea of the calm masculine figure you'd imagine would have smoked the pipe in its heyday.

But really, the justification should be that you enjoy it and it brings you peace. If she's worried about your health, well, that's a valid concern because this hobby isn't strictly "healthy." But neither are a lot of things, and if this is a hobby that you feel would bring you joy, explain that to her and take precautions for your health.

Mordenkrad: Jeeeesus. Smoke your pipe. If you feel like you need to justify it to yourself or your spouse and you can't do it with your own thoughts just stop and find another hobby.

SupraMario: I'd say his wife is a bit worried about his health, not so much that he can't smoke...at least this is what I take from it.
--
roccodai1: Yes, saying she is a bit worried would be putting it lightly ...but when you wanna smoke a pipe , you smoke pipe : ) 
--
SupraMario: True but do let her know if you're like me, smoking once or twice a week a bowl or two isnt really that bad, you get more carcinogens sitting in traffic or around a cap fire. Burning stuff is...Burning stuff....period.
