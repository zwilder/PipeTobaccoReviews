**Tin Description** - I got mine in bulk but I think Smokingpipes.com did a great one-liner "This unique Virginia blend, perfectly toasted into a deep black tobacco is flavored with a new special sweet but yet complex aroma."

**Leaf Appearance** - this tobacco was mostly black in color but had the occasional brown leather colored specks. The cut on the tobacco is a chunky ribbon style cut with lots of good size pieces. definitely not something I expect to clog your pipe.  over all its nothing to different from the average Black Cavendish look and feel besides that its a virginia cavendish rather than a burly cavendish.

**Tin Aroma** - This tobacco blend smelled down right delicious.  On the first couple whiffs, i get a almost overload of chocolate. Once the bold, rich, sweet smell of the chocolate took its fist out of my nose I could get a better hint of the true nature of this blend. Small hints of berries, plum, overall dried fruit flavors mingle with notes of sweet milk chocolate to produce a chocolate covered raisin smell that i'm absolutely in love with. I also kept getting vague hints of nuttiness like an almond cookie but it was very minimal. 

**Taste/Room Note** - The taste and smell of this tobacco was great but not like I was expecting. I was really hoping that a lot of the tin aroma would carry over seeing how it's an aromatic blend but I was kind of disappointed. Yeah, its got that amazing Chocolate covered raisin smell but without the other flavors added in, it was just to one noted. However, after saying that, I would still make it a tobacco in my rotation. This is a mild to medium bodied blend with very little nicotine. The fruit and chocolate play so well off each other that I  believe this blend would become an instant crowd pleaser in regards to the room note. the taste had a chemical feel to it towards the bottom of the bowl but other than that it stayed relatively close to the tin aroma. 

**Smoke-ability/burn** - This tobacco came super moist. almost sopping wet. It took forever for me to get it to the right moisture level. In all honestly, nothing hurts more than smoking a over moist tobacco and I made the mistake of doing that with this blend ONCE and only once. I learned my mistake the first time. I would recommend letting the tobacco dry until when pinched and dropped, it separates completely. even at that stage there is some moisture but in my experience nothing high enough to cause tongue bite. This blend almost reminds me of DarkStar in regards to moisture. Once I got the moisture level down, it smoked fine. It left a fine grey ash, Minimal to no wetness to the dottle and, no pooling of liquid at the bottom the bowl.

**Summary** - Over all, it was a great blend. Definitely a good change from the typical chocolate/vanilla aromatic blend. Once I got everything down and got rid of the dreaded tongue bite, it was a great smoke. Remember to dry this stuff out before smoking or you very well may turn your tongue into a strip of charred leather. other than that I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't try this guy out. If your a fan of chocolate covered raisins and cavendish then I would recommend you pick some up. 

**Background** - I've been smoking a pipe for four years and cigars for six. I have tried many blends and I prefer strong English blends and VaPur blends. when I smoke aromatics I like them to have some sort of vanilla or warm aroma.
