I was told about it, but want to get some first hand opinions about it first. Any reviews out there?
====================================
carnesy: Are you looking for the [McClelland Baklava](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/747/mcclelland-no-700-baklava) or the [Sutliff Baklava](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/9497/sutliff-tobacco-company-baklava)?

CptnTightPants: Unsure. I was given a name, and how much he liked it. That was all.

csobod: Unless I hear otherwise, I believe most Sutliff stuff, or what I've had so far, tends to be very cased and can get ghosty/tonguey. Unless you're talking about their "private reserve" stuff which, on the tin I had, was basically little less casing and a bunch better tobacco.

McLelland is kind of like the second one. Some stuff seems strong like a casing, but smokes smoothly and has excellent quality tobacco. However, I HAVE NOT HAD EITHER OF THESE, YET.

This is my hypothesis. As someone whose mother made them eat a lot of Anglo-Serbian interpreted Baklava, I will see it my duty to buy both, try both, and see what happens.

Stay tuned.

chewsyourownadv: LPT: Mark your post as a review if you are doing a review. 

That said, /u/carnesy's post should give an idea of what to look for. Happy hunting!

CptnTightPants: Then what would it be under, advice?
