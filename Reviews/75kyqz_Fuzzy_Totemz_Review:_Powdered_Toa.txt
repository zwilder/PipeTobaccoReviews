Review: Powdered Toast Kake (very long)
By: Fuzzy_Totemz
---
A few weeks back I did a ninja giveaway of a blend experiment. I was re-reading linear's notes on the how/why of Powdered Toast Man and it inspired me to take a stab at blending a twist of it.  
  
I wanted something a little bit richer for a breakfast smoke with coffee or as a dessert smoke, and of course pressed into a kake to marry the flavors.  
  
The result:  https://i.imgur.com/vIiqMW9.jpg  
  
This is not one of my Coffee infused Kakes. This is just Powdered Toast Man with the OTC Prince Albert subbed and then the whole thing force married.  
  
With the consent of the redditor, I am posting his well written tasting notes.

> I was excited to partake of your new blend. I thoroughly loved your kake. Each time I smoked a bowl I had a joyful experience. The kake crumbled easily enough. The tin aroma is hard to hard to describe because the different ingredients have married to form a delicate and subtle entity. It has a tender sweetness, nicely spiced, with a sometimes chocolate, vanilla, and nutty note all at once. Looking through the blend, I saw different cuts, some large and others fine. The colors ranged from golden to black. I must admit I salivated thinking of smoking it.

> The first time I smoked some, I broke it apart and let it dry for about 20 minutes. I did not have to relight it once. The charring light was all it needed. I tamped it and it still stayed lit. Even when I was inpatient and stuffed my bowl and smoked, I had to relight maybe two or three times, totally acceptable. With every smoking session, the white billows of smoke rewarded me with a sweet and creamy dessert like taste. Almost like an after-dinner espresso. My usual cadence of smoking is taking two puffs one after another and then to wait 30 seconds to puff again. I was unable to control myself with this blend. I felt like a kid in candy store, I wanted it all. I puffed on the pipe non-stop for the first few minutes I smoked this blend. To my amazement, I had no tongue bite. Not a single pinch.  
>
> The blend evolved during the smoke. After I slowed down and started to think of what I was smoking, I started sipping rather than gulping on the pipe. The taste had matured. It was still creamy and sweet, but more refined. No longer was I in a candy store, but sitting in an upscale restaurant eating a CrÃ¨me Brulee. My mature palate welcomed the change. Not until the near the bottom of the pipe bowl did it further evolve. It became bitter-sweet, like 65% dark chocolate with orange zest. It had fully evolved and so did I. I slowed my cadence even more and enjoyed the last wisps of smoke of the session. From toddler to adult, the blend developed while smoking it. I appreciated and relished all the fine nuances it had to offer.

> It was a delight to smoke each time and thankfully I still have enough for a few more bowls. You obviously have a gift and talent in mixing these blends and I thank you for your generosity for sharing it me and the r/pipetobacco crowd.
> Cheers and God Speed!  
  
My response.

> Thats, a really well written set of tasting notes and I would like to thank you for taking the time to write it.   
>  
> The true credit goes to u/linearone and u/coldsolderjoint who developed the base. I simply wanted to make a slight variant subbing out the prince albert with something a little richer that would meld better when pressed to make a variant slightly more tuned for early morning coffee or as a dessert smoke.  
>   
> Feel free to repost this to the sub with tags for linearone and coldsolderjoint since they really did the hard work that I merely tweaked.
>  
> You got to smoke a true unicorn blend since I only made three kakes total for my own curiosity and don't plan to make more because Powdered Toast is really their blend and I don't want to confuse people.  
>  
> *If you enjoyed the smoke and the pressed marriage produced my desired effect, then I am extremely happy and you sir made my day.*

> Cheers.  
  
Btw, how bout them tasting notes? Props to Bacardi! And thanks to linear and cold for their advice as I went about this.  *"But what flavor were you trying to isolate from the perique?"* They were real bros. 
  

====================================
coldsolderjoint: #NextLevel - Is that still cool to say? This is like when a chef re-invents a classic American homestyle food. Good job!

coldsolderjoint: humm.. obviously my knowledge of reddit operators like hashtag # is lacking
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: I wouldn't say next level. I'll just say variety is the spice of life.

This is just PTM's flattened relative.

====================================
wangchung80: Wow, that write up is beyond my skill set! Sounds like a truly  great blend!
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: I merely stood on the shoulders of giants. Mixing the components myself and working with them was pure bliss. Those rough cuts in the buttered rum are delectable texture wise.

Hand blending has a tactile joy and it gave me a great respect for what they had done before.

====================================
bacardi_limon: I felt I had to boost my review game knowing that u/Fuzzy_Totemz was a cultured and well traveled cosmopolite. The blend was truly enjoyable to smoke. Kudos to all involved! 
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: I don't pretend to speak for the subreddit, but your writing was definitely better than a paint by numbers JimInks review. A good smoke should inspire people and you seemed truly inspired.
--
givemeyours0ul: Paint by numbers.... Lol. 
--
====================================
Chemical_Lab: This sounds absolutely amazing!  

I probably need to pick up PTM one of these days...  and then, after getting to know it, try my hand at your successful experiment.

Thanks to all of you mad scientists out here.

Jokers247: Do you think that this would be good as a non cake? Subbing the PA for Angler in a regular blend of PTM?
