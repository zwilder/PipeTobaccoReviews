Erinmore Flake: A Review from a New Guy
By: JManSenior918

**Blend Name:** Erinmore Flake

**Description on Tin:** The Leaf tobaccos for Erinmore are selected from only premium tobacco growing regions of the World. The blend consists of mature Virginia, mellow Burley and sweet dark air cured tobaccos.It is pressed into cakes, aged and cut into slices providing a mellow and cool smoke with a flowery and fruity note.

**Leaf:** The flakes are quite dark with strands of gold woven in here and there. Cool and wet to the touch when fresh out of the tin.

**Tin Aroma:** I was born devoid of the ability to smell, though I've been told by my peers that it smells sweet and lemony.

**Taste:** From the notes I wrote at the time of smoking: This particular blend is very citrus-heavy in flavor, which I quite enjoy. There are hints of grass, or perhaps hay, woven into each properly taken puff.

The flavor is certainly fruity, and I find it different from what I'm used to and rather enjoyable. I know that around here aromatics are somewhat sneered at, and while I am definitely going to branch out and try as much as my wallet permits, I think there will always be some Erinmore in my cellar. 

**Smokability:** The flakes definitely need to be air dried for a little while before being smoked. My first smoke proved to be difficult because I was unaware of this, and as a result I had to relight many times before the end of the bowl. However, I have since dried it out properly and was able to smoke it all the way until the end without any trouble.

The flakes themselves are proving to be somewhat of a difficulty for me, likely because I'm so new to the hobby. I tend to pull the flakes apart before letting the tobacco dry out as this seems to give me consistency in smoke throughout the bowl and faster drying times.

**Room Note:** Again, I cannot be of much service here. However my understanding is that this is not an overbearing smoke by any means, though I was outside while smoking this and my peers tend not to be too bothered by smoke.

**Thoughts:** As I said above, there will likely be a little Erinmore in my cellar for as long as I am able to enjoy this hobby. The light and tasty smoke allows me to smoke continuously and enjoy this new-to-me ROA for tobacco. The yellow tin sits on my desk constantly begging me to take a break from my work.

**Recommend to:** I am by no means a tobacco expert, but if someone liked lighter, cooler tobaccos with a touch of aromatic flavoring but nothing overly goopy or sugary, this is what I would recommend. As my first pipe tobacco, I would also recommend it to anyone else who is looking for their first pipe-tobacco.

**Summary:** Enjoyed the light citrus and hay/grass flavors very much, will be purchasing again.

**My Background:** I have been smoking cigars with my dad for a few years now, he introduced me to the hobby that he loves so much when I became old enough to legally enjoy it for myself. His father had always enjoyed pipes as well as cigars so I had been curious about what piping was all about. Not that long ago I walked into my local B&M and purchased an estate Bebbia Cometa and this 50g tin of Erinmore Flake as recommended by the tobacconist who is familiar with my taste. 

I have since ordered two Frog Mortons (Cellar and Bayou), Capstan flake, and Nightcap and am very much looking forward to trying them and reviewing them here.
====================================
arterianSanor: Awesome! I'm also new when it comes to pipe smoking... And my first real tobacco was a flake as well (Capstan Gold Navy Cut) a friend from here recommended me and that was my very first real tobacco, I see that you've also ordered some Capstan. I'm really curious if Capstan and Erinmore have similarities... Maybe when you have the opportunity to try it, you can make a comparison. Because Erinmore is in my to-try list.

antiwittgenstein: Great Review mate! Glad to see some new voices in the sub. Keep em coming.

pixeechick: This one's on my up-and-coming list; thanks for the review. This was great! Flakes were a problem for me at first as well, but hang with it, you'll get it. 
--
JManSenior918: Thanks, I appreciate it! Can I ask which packing method you use?
--
pixeechick: I typically rub my flakes out. I've also used cube cut to a decent effect, but I'm still working on getting that style suitably dry before lighting.

cgvet9702: Erinmore is unique, that's for sure. I've smoked it off and on over the years, especially when I'm in a rut and I need something to wake up my palate. I enjoy the pineapple flavor. Until they ran out of it, I used to buy pre metric tins of cube cut from my local pipe shop. They've been in business since 1928 and routinely find caches of long out of production blends like that down in their basement. 

Be warned, though. Erinmore will ghost a pipe like nobody's business. 
--
JManSenior918: It's ghosts that bad? I'm rather new to piping but I guess I'm surprised to hear that because it seems pretty mellow compared to other aromatics. But thanks for the heads up!
--
cgvet9702: It definitely lingers in the briar which isn't always bad. Sometimes that hint of erinmore will meld with a later blend and create some interesting flavor profiles. If ghosting is problematic, you could always smoke it in a cob or some other dedicated pipe.
