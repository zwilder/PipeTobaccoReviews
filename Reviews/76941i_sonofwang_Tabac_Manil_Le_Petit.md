Tabac Manil Le Petite Robin back at SP also mini review/observations

Kinda surprised no one mentioned it so I figured I would. I was thinking it has been hard to find? Maybe not. I would have bought some but had already bought from Pipe Guys. Wanted some after trying a sample a kind sub member sent me. 

This may be common knowledge - I haven’t read many reviews - but I noticed something interesting today when I got my order in. I open the side of the packet and pulled out a bit of the shag. It seemed darker than the sample I received but I didn’t think anything of it. When I smoked it though it was much harsher than the sample I received which was lighter in color, smoked smoother, and had a subtle sweetness. 

Opening the packet a bit more I saw the distinct color differences throughout the brick. Pretty interesting. It appear that during processing the color difference reflects either different parts of a leaf or different leaves on the plant and that the overall result is not mixed together in processing. The dark part reminds me of 5 brothers and the light part is more representative of the reviews of semois buttery smoothness. Two blends in one! I wonder if others have noticed this.

====================================
freepancakesforall: I've opened quite a few bricks and have noticed that consistency is not their strong suit. I've opened one or two that looked like this. It's not rotted tobacco, it's just a heavier, unmixed portion of semois.    

This guy hand blends these in a farmhouse basement. Some bricks are more virginia, some are like this, and some are perfectly marbled. I'd shoot him an email if you're worried about it, but this just looks like a huge clump of semois that didn't get mixed in too thoroughly.    

Paging u/levins0 for a second opinion though. If he doesn't know then we're all in big, big trouble.

levins0: No pressure, right?  :)

I agree I've seen bricks like this.  Doesn't really seem to affect the taste much, though.  I'd suggest tossing it in a bowl and mixing thoroughly -- should help.

As I understand it, Manil sources the thin Virginia strands from elsewhere and then blends it with his Semois.  I would think that if he thought it was a problem, he would not have put out the product.

The more curious thing to me, having taken a second look at the picture, is that the cut of the Virginia in the OP's picture is different from what I have.  His is more of a regular ribbon type cut, while mine (from 2016) is more hair-like, like kizami.

stogie-bear: That’s weird. The dark part looks wrong, like it’s rotted or something. There’s no blend component that’s that color. 

I wouldn’t smoke it, I’d ask for a replacement. I’m away from home for a couple days but when I get back I’ll take a photo of my Petit Robin (I just stuck the whole brick in a jar) so you can see.

sonofwang: It doesn’t  smell bad or seem like its rotten. Just different. It’s very very similar in color and texture to 5 brothers.  I’m not mad. I just see this as maybe variation in a natural product that doesn’t undergo a lot of processing or maybe it slipped through some QA cracks. It happens. Who knows the reason for it...

I separated the brick and it was about half and half light and dark. 

I opened the other brick I got and it is almost all light with a very small vein of the darker shag. 

I really like this stuff so this was in no way meant to be a shot at Tabac Manil. And of course The Pipes Guys had nothing to do with it. First order from them and a good experience.

stogie-bear: It looks pretty busted to me. Can I get a second opinion from any Manil experts? /u/4noggins you ever seen this?

SmokeOnTheWater17: It looks overcooked.

sonofwang: I opened the other brick I bought and it is almost completely uniform in the light color with just a small vein of the darker running through it.
