[REVIEW] Planta Tabak - Rum & Maple no.53
By: AsIfThatWouldHappen
---

====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: As most of us are aware this is an OTC Codger Blend, I got a tin in a lot of tobacco I purchased a while back and it isn't something I would normally buy. I have tried not to let this skew my review being a non-aro smoker. Enjoy.

Aromatic Burley/Virginia (My 100g tin was the later Planta product, not the Lane Limited blend that seems much more well known and well liked)

“Good by itself, good as a mixture” - A familiar old classic, this blend expertly mixes Bright Virginias and rich Burleys with the contrasting flavors of Rum and Maple. An interesting and pleasant smoke. (Also sold as Tinderbox Mashpee Maple)

Leaf: Ribbon cut, dark gold and brown, much more Burley than Va, moist in the tin and definitely wanting drying time. 10 seconds in the microwave wrapped in a paper towel dried a bowl out for me just fine. Smelled amazing when heated up too.

Tin Aroma: This was great, not really rum like...or maple like either. It did smell like a fruit cake or some sort of sweet Christmas pudding or similar, maybe a little maple which gave it the sweetness, but no rum that I could detect. The tobacco itself is nice and it definitely smells like quality leaf, I don’t typically smoke Aros so the topping aroma may seem more powerful to me than it actually is. It smelled like I could eat it out of the tin as a dessert, I may still try this in an effort to see if there is any actual flavor in there.

Taste: Sadly not a lot to say here, very little if any of the aroma comes over with the taste, the tobacco itself is fresh and has no nasty tastes or unexpected difference to the usual Codger blends with Bu or Va, The burley is nutty and bready, the Va’s are noticeable and fresh and grassy, but nothing shines here, it is a little sweet presumably from the maple topping, no rum that I could find. I cannot say there is anything wrong with this blend, there just isn’t anything particularly good about it. If it was flavored more strongly it could be great.

Smokability: Mine has been in the tin since Xmas day and is still wet despite being opened constantly for me to take bowls out, definitely benefits from some drying time. Not very nice when smoked wet, so avoid it as usual. When it’s dry it packs easy, lights easy, stays lit, and surprisingly doesn’t bite at all if you smoke sensibly. Very easy to smoke and a fine all day blend if you don’t want to get mentally invested in your smoke.

Summary: Nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either. This blend is as middle of the road as it comes, which is a shame, if it was flavored more it would be great, if the tobacco taste was more pronounced, it would be great. As it is, both are pretty unremarkable. The room note and tin note are great though, no denying that. Easy all day smoke for mindless bowls while you plod around doing things or just need a quick smoke, short of that I can’t see a reason to smoke it. I’m not an aro smoker but I don’t think there is enough flavor here to appeal to you if you are, and there isn’t enough of anything else going for it to recommend it to anyone else.

 I am sure the number of bulk “Rum and Maples” out there from any number of companies would be as good as or better than this if you were inclined to have some.

I will happily finish this tin as the kind of OTC you use when you are in a jam, but look forward to getting back to better tobaccos.
Score – 1.5/5

Pandam: That rum seems to be a very well made dota reference. Neat!

givemeyours0ul: All I can think when I see that picture is HD-ARRRRRR. Pirates+oversaturation.  
My take away: "It smelled like I could eat it out of the tin as a dessert, I may still try this in an effort to see if there is any actual flavor in there."
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Well Played haha. I will be sure to reviews it as a chew if I decide to try that. Might empty the tin a bit quicker.
--
givemeyours0ul: I just can't bring myself to try chaw. No real reason other than I think dip is gross. I understand that dipping and chewing are totally different, but I still can't.

trolljoy: The original war horse was often chewed in addition to being cut/rubbed/smoked.  
   
Not my bag of tea, but it goes back to blue collar pipe tobacco versus 50 pipe collections and artisian single barrel blends.
--
givemeyours0ul: I feel, rightly or wrongly, that it goes back to a time when having shredded teeth was way more socially acceptable. I also gave a loud laugh/snort at "artisian single barrel blends".   
Excuse me, I'm going to go chew some 'zance.

trolljoy: It was a complicated joke. Some hipsters got into chocolate making trying to take other hipster ideals for farm to table food and apply it to overpriced gourmet chocolate. They tried to brand "single sourced" chocolate.  
  
Well, chocolate don't work that way. You take as much chocolate from as much source as you can to smooth out the flavor.  
  
It turned out their chocolate was basically factory chocolate mislabeled and when they finally did try making single-source chocolate, it was awful because of the previous explanation.  
  
There are some "single barrel" or "single source" tobaccos, but there doesn't seem to be hispter mistique about them. Russ O has made some blends based on undiluted perique from the four plantations the tobacco comes from.  Semois comes from one place. Russ O's Acadian Gold is off a single barrel experiment. And Lane has the blend based on perique style cigar leaf fermenting.

givemeyours0ul: Oh I got it, though I didn't know about the coffee thing.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: I do enjoy a good lip of dip, picked it up when working with Marines in my Army days when they came over to Australia.
Sadly you cant buy it here. I chew ropes whenever I buy them but have never tried a proper U.S style chew. It's on the to-do list.

Pipezilla: How's that rope tobacco?
