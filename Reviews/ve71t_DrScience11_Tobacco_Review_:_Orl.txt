Tobacco Review : Orlik Golden Sliced
By: DrScience11
---
**Blend Name**: Golden Sliced

**Description on Tin**:A blend of golden, fully ripe Virginia and a little Perique. Naturally sweet.

**Looks**: Golden is a good word, light gold and yellow-brown tobacco, in a giant flake-like thing. They're essentially tightly bound strands of flake. You can pull off some and rub it out. It's more like one big piece than anything else.

**Smells**: It smells a little sour at first, but there are fresh hay like scents. There's a hint of some sweetness here, in the form of light citrus notes. Reminds me a tiny bit of lemon.

**Taste**: I honestly can say, this is the first tobacco I've had with prominent citrus notes of orange. The orange is kind of sour and sweet at the same time, and adds the majority of the sweet flavors.  There are some floral and hay like notes underlying this, that make this a very light and delicate flavored blend.  

**Smokeability** : Rubbed out, it packs in dense but easily. Burned fairly well, and dryly. It did burn fairly hot, but not unbearably so.

**Compare to** : Sherlock Holmes, Full Virginia flake, maybe a mild mild erinmore flake.

**Summary**:  I really enjoyed this blend. The room note is a spectacular orange/floral scent, that is light and pleasing.  The flavors are different and delicate. It's a mellow but pleasing smoke.  I'm thrilled to actually have citrus/orange playing a starring role, as opposed to being a hidden flavor you might taste if you're lucky.  The citrus flavors really couple well with the tiny bit of floral and hay in the undertones. They're both light and sweet, and mesh perfectly together.  The blend features some perique, but it must be in small quantities, because I did not notice it.  I should note, upon first light the scent/flavor was eerily cigarette like, but this quickly faded.

**Rating : 4/5**

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak, Samuel Gawith's Full Virginia Flake, and Dunhill's Nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of Virginia and English blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q and Dan's Blue Note. I've been piping for almost 9 months, and smoke frequently.

If you enjoy my reviews, let me know. Criticism appreciated! Also if you have a request, please ask. 

To your good health /r/pipetobacco! May your pipe be forever held high!

====================================
HEXAEMERON: I really need to check this out. This evening, I'm planning on opening my first tin of SG FVF, I'm really looking forward to it.  
Also, happy cakeday DS!
--
DrScience11: Why thank you! I almost hadn't noticed!

Dude you are gonna enjoy that so much. 
--
HEXAEMERON: I just opened the tin for a sniff. I wanted to shove that stuff in my mouth because it smelled so good. As soon as the rain ends, I'm going out to enjoy.
--
DrScience11: you'll have to let me know what you think. it's life changing
--
HEXAEMERON: Phenomenal. Absolutely brilliant. A smooth smoke with great flavor and just the slightest buzz. I could see this becoming a standard for me.
--
DrScience11: See, now that you've tasted the sweet nectar, you'll never be able to find the shit. It's like the most difficult tobacco to get. Glad you liked it though!
--
HEXAEMERON: Next time I find FVF or Esoterica's Penzance, I'm stocking up like it's the apocalypse. 
--
DrScience11: That's the tactic.  Is penzance hard to find? I feel like I've seen it in a B&M recently....but I haven't had any of the esoterica blends so I wasn't paying attention.
--
HEXAEMERON: Yes it is. Not as difficult as Stonehaven, but still hard to find. If you happen to see some at your B&M, I would happily pay you to pick some up and ship it, if you'd be willing to. 
--
DrScience11: I'll be sure to check next time I'm there. It's very possible I was mistaken though.
--
====================================
extravagant: If you like this sweeter VA+Perique you might also want to try Dunhill De Luxe Navy Rolls. I got some a few weeks ago and it's been really enjoyable. Also look into Rattray's Marlin Flake which I haven't smoked in a while but I remember enjoying.

I think I'm moving into a VA+Perique phase...
--
emblemparade: And let's not forget Frog Morton on the Bayou! A real treat. I would recommend it even if you don't generally like McLelland's somewhat syrupy aged Virginia. In the Frog Mortons, the balance is just perfect.
--
====================================
CloseEnough11: Favorite blend of mine. 
--
DrScience11: Much respect for that.
--
====================================
thisshiphassailed: Great review. I thoroughly enjoy OGS though I haven't had much in terms of Virginia-dominant tobaccos. I agree that it tastes a lot like a cigarette during the false light but that disappears immediately. In my personal experience, the first time I smoked this I was indoors and the combination of flavors and room note went from citrus-hay to a very creamy buttery hay. It was fucking amazing. I don't know if all Virginias are like this but it left my room smelling like cigarettes for days so I haven't smoke it indoors since and have never experienced that creamy buttery heaven I once glimpsed. It's almost worth trying again.
--
DrScience11: I've found the cigarette-ish stuff once or twice on Virginia's that aren't very good. It's not typical of top tier stuff. If it persisted any longer in the false light, it would dropped worlds in my opinion. So I'm glad it got so much better.

I could see some buttery flavors. I'll look for that next time I have a bowl!

====================================
chiuta: Thanks for the great review as usual. I'm looking forward to trying this blend even more now. 
--
====================================
KashmirKnitter: That sounds fantastic. I'm really grateful that people on this sub write such thorough reviews, it makes it so much easier to branch out beyond what you know when you can read a few before you place an order.  

And happy cakeday!

====================================
emblemparade: Nice! I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, which I think has a pleasant, dry Earl-Grey citrus aftertaste, so I'm excited to hear about the sour citrus you detect here. Could you try to compare the two, maybe, in terms of body/flavor/texture?
--
DrScience11: I would say that sherlock holmes is a bit more mild, and in general has more "tobacco"-y flavors.  While the golden slice definately has the stronger flavors in terms of citrus and such. The flavors in golden sliced are much much more pronounced.  They're both fairly lightly bodied, and have similar mouth feels. I think golden sliced is like what sherlock holmes SHOULD be.  A better version if you will
--
emblemparade: Heh, thanks. I happen to like the tobacco-y flavor (I'm primarilly an English smoker) but will give OGS a try.
--
ClassyCodswallop: If you like that citrusy taste, get a bit of Dunhill Flake. If you haven't already, that is.
--
DrScience11: I've been wanting to get some. Keep having issues for one reason or another. 
--
====================================
BarkingLeopard: Very nice, thanks for the review, and I know I've requested this one be reviewed in the recent past.  Thought about adding this to my tobacco purchase, but decided to wait.... Thankfully it is one of the few non-Dunhill tins my B&M carries if I get impatient.


I read other reviews that described this as a fairly mild Va that would work well as an all-day smoke, sounds like it would be based on your review.


From your review, I'm getting the sense that this is almost the hefeweizen of pipe tobaccos: sessionable, with citrus notes, and great to partake on the porch on hot summer afternoons and evenings.


Finally, would this be considered an aromatic or more of a straight Virginia?  I don't see an entry for this one in the Google Docs review summary page yet.
--
DrScience11: Oops! Yes I forgot to add it! Thank you! It's a straight Virginia, no additions.

I would agree with the hefeweizen analogy, thats a great way to put it.
--
Frostie2013: It does contain perique.
--
DrScience11: True. I meant additions that would make it an aromatic, like topping/casing. But you are correct.
--
====================================
Vl4d: A wonderful review!  I've always enjoyed to blend, but I've never been able to say why. You did a great job of that. Even reminded me that I need to refresh the half tin I got before I hit the road.

Cheers!
--
====================================
ElGatoTheManCat: I agree with kashmirknitter, reviews like this one encourage me, a beginner, to branch out more. Really appreciate it!
--
====================================
jormungandr9: I just ordered this and I cannot wait to try it. Thanks!
