Tobacco Review: McClelland 2015 Virginia Perique Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 62

**Blend Name:** McClelland 2015 Virginia Perique Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** This popular flake from McClelland is made from orange and red Virginias, to which enough Perique has been added to create a refreshing smoke with a satisfying richness and depth of flavor.

**Leaf:** Extremely thick broken flake, about twice as thick as the other McClelland flakes I have had. Chocolate brown with some white streaks.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, Heinz 57, 9 grain wheat bread.

**Taste:** Woodsy. Sweet and peppery. Slight red wine vinegar taste. Red pepper flakes. Like you shook too much out on your pizza and can’t taste the mozzarella or bread or whatever. Woodsy, I know I said that already, but it needs to be said twice. Almost tastes like some Latakia was in there, a delicate smoky note. The sweetness is pretty subdued too. Oaky. I hope that isn’t redundant, but it is particularly oaky, like the taste of the barrel stolen up by old bourbon. Very bourbon, with that touch of char. A mellow nuttiness is there hiding in the woods. The vinegar and pepper builds than recedes back into oak and nuttiness and char. Comes and goes, comes and goes.

**Nicotine:** Pretty heavy for Virginia flake. I am usually toast by the end of medium-small bowl.

**Smokability:** Not so great not so bad. Hard to get lit and goes out pretty often. I like to dry it out and crack it up into little bits gravity feed. Even then, some of the chunks are so big that the cherry seems reluctant to catch them on fire. I would advise you to try to alternate layers of shake and chunks. Or just have your lighting implement of choice handy.
 
**Room Note:** Oeuf, cheap cigarettes. Not so great.

**Thoughts:** Now that I have a had couple of VaPer flakes, I can say pretty firmly that I prefer them to ribbon cut blends. Mind you I still really enjoy Anniversary Kake and few other blends in the same vein, only I find their range and depth of flavors to be quite limited by comparison. Ribbon VaPers seem to be sweeter, fruity, more red wine vinegar. Though I need to smoke more flake VaPers to really prove this one out. 
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Sutliff Court of St. James.
 
**Summary:** A woodsy classic style VaPer flake.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

antiwittgenstein: There is quite a bit of variety out there. Which VA's have you smoked so far? What kind of flavors predominated?

antiwittgenstein: That's a fair assortment of Virginia's I think, for a non VA hound that is. Most of those fall into a pretty narrow flavor profile. Try out a stoved flake. I think Blackwoods is the best one out there, but there is lots of love for Dark Star and Full Virginia Flake. The VaPer subgenre can be a little more dynamic, I can highly recommend Anniversary Kake, Court of St. James, and of course, the aforementioned McC 2015 Flake.

====================================
tribial: Always a fan of your reviews. Sounds like another to try..... oh no
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks, but don't worry this one comes in bulk, so it is like $3 if you just want one ounce.
--
chewsyourownadv: Zoinks! My wife gave me a bulk tobacco labelled with a different name a while back, claiming itself to be a VaPer. The scent was typical McClelland so I suspected it was one of theirs, re-branded. But re-reading your review, I'm convinced now it's actually this blend. Neat-o! I'll need to revisit it and compare.
--
antiwittgenstein: Glad to help. Does it look similar to [this?](https://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/mcclelland/bulk/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=3979) Their flake is much more uniform than mine. I'm intrigued. Let me know if you have bagged the culprit.

====================================
chewsyourownadv: I'm taking a couple of statements in your review here to suggest you are new-ish to VaPers? If so, know that the extra nic hit likely comes from the perique, being fermented burley. It's stout stuff on its own, and there is an old tradition of perique farmers and other workers daring one another to smoke a bowl of the stuff straight.

Also, have you tried out Escudo yet?
--
antiwittgenstein: This is my 9th VaPer I've reviewed, so I knew to expect a nic hit, but it is pretty heavy, up there with Bayou Morning. 

Escudo is next in my review queue, but I haven't cracked it open yet.
--
chewsyourownadv: Looking forward to it. It's *supposed* to be the gold standard of VaPers, but I never really got that from it.
