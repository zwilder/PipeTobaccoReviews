Tobacco Review : Dunhill's Nightcap
By: DrScience11
---
Again, this is very popular, but it'd be good for newbies to know more about it other than that pipeit loves this stuff.

**Blend Name**: Nightcap

**Description on Tin**:A rich blend for late in the day. It is a slow, lasting smoke. Just prior to packing, expensive Perique tobacco is added to enhance to bouquet.

**Looks**: Dark even ribbons.  Rich browns and blacks.

**Smells**: Exquisite, sweet campfire aroma.  A rich earthy-ness undertone that makes the scent simply wonderful. It reminds me over being outdoors on a starry fall night around a campfire.  

**Taste**: Rich earth notes, bold spice, cool smokey cures, and hints of nuttiness.  The latakia is excellently blended, and in my opinion is the best possible ratio to the other tobaccos. Its balanced, and smooth.  The turkish tobacco is a nice inclusion, that combined with the latakia gives the darker earth notes that so wonderfully complement the smokey flavors.  The perique gives note of spice on the finish that contrasts nicely with the latakia flavors.  The spicyness also leads the way to a bit of a nutty aftertaste.  

**Compare to** : Squardon leader, frog morton, skiff mixture, early morning pipe. Pick an english blend.

**Summary**: For the English smoker, this represents the pinnacle of tobacco blends.  It strikes the best balance between all the constituent parts, and delivers a cool, flavorful blend.  This harmony of flavors both brings out the loveliness of the latakia, while simultaneously keeping it from being domineering, as it tends to be. I'm not sure if this truly is the best thing to do before bed, but it is the making for a fabulous evening of relaxation.

**Rating : 5 / 5**

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak and Dunhill's nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of English blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q. I've been piping for almost 7 months, and smoke frequently.

DrScience11: Thanks for the complement!  I'll see if my friends have it, and or see if I can pick some up during my next lapse of T.A.D. !

mattgold: I tried Nightcap, and found that it smelled overwhelmingly like barbecue. Is it supposed to?
--
DrScience11: thats the smokey flavors of the latakia. All english blends have that campfire smoke flavor. I could see you associating that with barbecue
--
IAmAlistairHennessey: That's the only way I could describe the smell of latakia when I first smelled it -- barbecue. 
--
scared2mosh: I always thought nightcap in the tin smells like smoked bacon. 
--
DrScience11: Thanks, now I won't be able to un-smell that......though bacon is amazing...
--
scared2mosh: Hahaha.
--
mattgold: Can you recommend some good blends that wouldn't have this flavor?
--
DrScience11: Yea, non-english ones. The campfire smoke taste is the defining flavor of english blends. They all contain latakia. If you don't like it, then stick to non-english and aromatics

Buttock: Another amazing review. Thanks!

MajorTom89: Excellent review. Very pro. I'll be checking this blend out now. Thank you.

HellOnAStick: the good old great. I've been working up to this. I think I'll have to have a pipe that I dedicate strictly to English blends, though, as the latakia seems to have a reputation for ghosting up the pipe pretty fiercely. I have a pipe dedicated to Virginias and a pipe for aromatics...Looks like I need a flake pipe and an english pipe. Any recommendations as to what this smokes best in?
--
DrScience11: Wide bowls, like a pot shape, tend to do well with english.
--
HellOnAStick: Wide and shallow. I'll keep that in mind, thanks!

====================================
dataset: Man, this is a real good review. Having smoked this, I know what it's like, but now I know why it is the way that it is, which is something quite a few more... poetic reviews lack.  

Thanks!

Smythasaurus: Great review! I would defiantly have to say that the "peppery" taste that I experienced about 2/3's of the way through really was the most enjoyable part of this blend.  The smoky taste all the way through was also really  nice without being too overpowering. Very cool burning and defiantly has a bit of an N kick to it.
--
DrScience11: Yea I like a bit of Perique (the peppery tobacco) on stout English blends. Adds a little something special. Nightcap is the quintessential English blend in my humble opinion.
