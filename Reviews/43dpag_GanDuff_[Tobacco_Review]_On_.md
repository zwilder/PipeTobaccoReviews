[Tobacco Review] On the Square: A Tobacco for All
By: GanDuff
---
If you don't already know, On the Square is a tobacco blend created by our very own /u/blendrecommender, and blended by The Humidor, a tobacco shop in Murfreesboro, TN.

It is an English blend, described as being "a bold yet smooth blend of rich Red Virginias, smoky Cyprian Latakia, a healthy dose of spicy Perique and a touch of crisp White Burley. Perfect for ambling downtown or relaxing on the porch."    
And by golly, it's all that.

I was fortunate enough to get a sample from Adrien himself, and after a couple of bowls, I thought I'd share my thoughts on this blend. Adrien, if you're reading this, thank you.

It should be said that prior to this blend, I've only had a handful of English blends, and I was never really impressed by them. Nevertheless, I didn't hate Englishes or Latakia, and I was still willing to try English blends in the hopes that something changes my mind. And something did (although, there was Plum Pu--we'll get to that later).

**The nose:**    
As with many English blends, the moment I received the envelope in the mail, all I smelled was the smokey Latakia coming through the packaging. However, upon opening the the actual bag and taking another whiff, I got less Latakia than I initially thought I'd smell, and was then hit by a sweetness and some dried fruit.

**The cut and moisture:**    
To me, this looks like a cube cut, or at least something similar. Rough cut/cube cut?    
The moisture content was perfect. Wasn't wet, and it didn't need any drying time when I got to it.

**The taste and smoke:**    
As ThomasiusPufendorff of YouTube would say, "[this....is....excellent!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFP3WjFEfkY)"

I was shocked at just how good the initial light was; at how much the taste had already begun to exceed my expectations and left them far behind. All right, I'm getting ahead of myself here. Let's take a step back.

On the first light, I got got a similar experience to that of Plum Pudding, but not quite: smooth, smokey Latakia and sweetness. The Latakia wasn't heavy, but it was there, complimenting the Virginia that I was tasting. Sweet and slightly smokey, a great start.

Some minor tamping and a true light later, we start experiencing a few more things. The Virginias are probably the main players here, with the Latakia really playing its role as a condiment tobacco, and not trying to be more than that. Beyond that, I start noticing a small peppery sensation, the slightest bit of zest--Perique! How nice, it's not trying to kill me in this tobacco, and I almost forget that it's there.    
Now, there's something else going on, but it's not completely showing up in the first quarter of the bowl, but I can sense it giving the smoke some body.    
*A whisper is heard in the distance: "Burleee~y"*

Quarter of the way down and things start to change a bit. Here is when we start to see the Latakia really take a step back and almost seem like it isn't there. Instead, the white Burley starts to show. The sweetness of the tobacco doesn't disappear, but it gives way to the nutty and dry qualities of the Burley. While it doesn't take over, the Burley makes itself known; and for a few moments here and there, I could clearly taste it. I think this keeps things interesting and doesn't allow for the smoke to get boring.

Side note: This is surprisingly a very similar experience to Mississippi River at this point, minus the Burley.

I think this is also a good time to mention just how well this blend smokes. It smokes nicely, dry, and cool throughout the entire bowl, with minimal if any relights needed.

For the remainder of the bowl, the experience is consistent with the Burley popping up a few times. The Latakia stays in the background, not forgotten, but there. The Perique acts very similarly, in that it's there, but doesn't pester you with being too peppery or spicy, not at all.

**Strength and flavor:**    
This is a light-to-medium blend as far as strength is concerned. I honestly didn't notice the nicotine all that much, which is good for me. The flavor is mellow-to-medium, leaning more on the medium due to the great body and mouthfeel of the smoke, I would say. 

**Edit - The morning after:**    
I don't usually think to add this part in a review, but it's worth noting here. This blend will leave your throat and sinuses feeling a little raw. Not nearly as bad as a fresh batch of C&D's Bayou Morning, but it's something to watch out for. I forgot about it the first time I smoked this, and was quickly reminded when I got up this morning.

**Final thoughts:**    
This is a wonderful blend, truly. I love the balance of it all, and it really is balanced.

On the Square is like a really good English household. The Virginia is the host, sweet and is the main person you see throughout your stay there. The Latakia is the ever-classy butler, welcoming you into the household, always doing his job in the background, but never obtrusive. The Burley is like the housekeeper, caring for the entire house; although, you will run into the housekeeping a couple of times. The Perique acts like the servants of the house; always around, but easily forgotten, in the best of ways.

I think this is a wonderful blend that can be easily smoked all day. It's interesting enough that it won't bore you, but not overly complex that it demands your attention. It also behaves so well that you really won't need to fuss with it or worry that it won't stay lit. What I love is that Adrien used the Latakia and Perique as condiment tobaccos, and he did so masterfully.    
**Edit:** My only gripe with this blend is the morning after feeling I get from smoking it. It's possible that the Burley and Perique in this blend attribute to that morning after, raw sensation you might get. However, it's not too bad, and hopefully with a little age it'll mellow out.

I think this would make a great introduction tobacco for Englishes, and a fantastic example of how condiment tobaccos are used.

**Similar blends:**    
Mississippi River is a very similar style bend. It's also not too far from Plum Pudding, if you remove the incense (oriental) tastes and notes, and maybe a little less sweet and pungent.

Well, that's about it. I think I'm going to enjoy the last bit of this blend tomorrow, and then cry when I'm all out. Suffice it to say that I'll probably be getting a whole bunch of this when I can.

Adrien, thank you for sharing this tobacco, it's truly wonderful stuff.

GanDuff: Thanks! I just noticed that you were the only other person to review this blend, and it seems like we both have similar thoughts on it.

I guess it does have disparate flavors all playing together, but it somehow works for me as well. I gotta say, I really wanted to smoke another bowl today, but opted for something else, and then immediately regretted my decision, haha.

I think everyone should give this blend a go, as it is so varied that you can hardly go wrong with it. I also love that it's a red Virginia blend first, which almost anyone can enjoy, and then the rest of the components are used as condiments that play off each other superbly.

tribial: The problem with a good review like this one is it makes me want to immediately buy some! Thanks anyways I guess, ha. I liked the analogy at the end. I am not familiar with the morning after sensation, but that may be because I smoked cigarettes for over 10 years every day so I may be sort of immune to it (or more likely just permanently damaged)
--
GanDuff: Thank you for the kind words, I'm glad you enjoyed reading the review. If it sounds like this is something that's interesting to you, or it's the kind of flavor profile you'd like in a blend, I would highly recommend giving a try.

As far as the morning after sensation, that's not a common thing, but it can happen with certain tobaccos, especially more natural and raw ones that haven't aged much.

I was a cigarette smoker for many years as well (about 9), but this can still happen with certain blends. It's more of a rough, raw-like feeling in your throat, but more up towards your sinuses. Still, it might not happen with everyone, and it's not too bad if it does.

tribial: The only way I can relate to this is maybe with intensive retrohaling. Cigars can rough me up when I retrohale heavily.
--
GanDuff: I was definitely retrohaling, which does play a part in all this. However, it still differs from blend to blend and person to person.

It's really not a detriment to the blend, but it's something that I thought I should mention.

blendrecommender: Wow, excellent review. Thank you very much for taking the time to put your thoughts on it here. I'm thrilled you like it. I now want to name a blend "Proper English House" or something similar. Great comparison!

Thank you again!

GanDuff: You're very welcome. I had as much pleasure writing this review as I did smoking your blend.

It really was that "Aha!" moment for me, when I finally found that perfect balance of Latakia in a blend (a good one at that), where I can thoroughly enjoy it without it being overbearing.

I really do hope you find success with this blend.

Cheers
