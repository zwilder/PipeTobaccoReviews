Tobacco Review: Sutliff Pumpkin Spice
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 91

**Blend Name:** Sutliff Pumpkin Spice
 
**Description on Tin:** Sassy sales pitch from smokingpipes: Diverse pumpkin flavored products such as ice cream, cheesecake and beer are seasonally produced, so it stands to reason there should be a pumpkin flavored pipe tobacco. Sutliff's Pumpkin Spice is a tasty mixture of Burley, Virginia and black Cavendish, destined to become a holiday favorite.

**Leaf:** Brown and black goopy ribbon. The kind that luxuriates in PG like Countess Báthory de Ecsed did in blood.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Tobacco. Vanilla, caramel, custard. Vanilla pudding really, eggy and rich with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled on top. Black pepper and a bit of decay.  

**Age when smoked:** Fresh off the truck.

**Taste:** Sugary. Vanilla custard indeed. Caramelly. Something that smacks of decay and dirt, but in a good way, just like in a Starbucks PSL. If this isn’t just a rebranded Taste of Autumn, I will retire from reviewing. Something waxy. Again not in an unpleasant way, no Lakeland flashbacks, but like Oban scotch if you are into that. Buttery. Butterscotch. Finally the spices after a few minutes, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. Rummy. Could easily be Sutliff Spiced Rum if they needed to rebrand it a 3rd time. Rich dirt and spices and warm vanilla pudding. Candied apples? Just a sharp bit here and there which seems more fruity than rich dessert. Maybe that is just tongue bite? Retrohaling really intesnfies the baking spice flavors. The more I smoke the more I think this is apples, still bright and crisp, similar to DE Harvest on the Hudson. There is a whole lot going on here. If you want an aromatic that is as fun and difficult to pull apart as kitchen sink English or Balkan, this one is for you. Raisins and if I was doing a whisky tasting, tobacco flavor. Which is a weird note to mark in a pipe tobacco review, but there ya go. Settles back down into the rich spiced vanilla pudding with a couple of apple slices thrown in. This side stream is incredible and makes me wish I still had a place I could smoke indoors. And for this last quarter of the bowl it behaves, doesn’t go out, the flavors stay rich and easy, and for these ten or fifteen minutes it is everything I thought an aromatic could be, and what my pre-pipe expectation of the experience would be.

**Nicotine:** 2

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Good compared to a McLelland aged flake. Which is a nice way of saying terrible. Hard to light. Constantly needs relights. Never fully dries. Bites a little bit. When it smokes it creates a beautiful creamy smoke though.
 
**Side stream aroma:** Rich, sweet, pleasant. Similar to Captain Black Royal I think, so top notch. 

**Thoughts:** The hope was that this stuff was the same as [Sutliff Taste of Autumn ]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3s1s1d/tobacco_review_sutliff_taste_of_autumn/ ) one of my all time favorite aromatics, recently discontinued. I had my hopes, as Taste of Spring and Taste of Summer were still in production, but this bulk blend appeared right around the time the Premium product disappear. After my first smoke, I was dead sure it was the same, or close to the same stuff. I reached out to Sutliff via their website. Their prompt reply:

> You are spot on in the fact that Pumpkin Spice and Taste of Autumn are very, very, very, very, very similar! ;-)
 
I hadn’t looked at that review before smoking this, so how similar were they? Pretty straight on. I found Virginia instead of Apple, but besides that, they are ostensibly identical. Even my editorial remarks agree.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Sutliff Taste of Autumn, Captain Black Royal, Sutliff Barbados Plantation, Strauss Sleepy Hollow, C&D Autumn Evening, DE Harvest on the Hudson
 
**Summary:** Pumpkin Spice! 

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and Sutliff Pumpkin Spice (Aro).

This was a special request, rush review for the benefit of /u/carnesy 

====================================
phonkubot: There aren’t enough Bathory references in contemporary tobacco reviews, thank you. 
--
antiwittgenstein: I found it strange myself and thought to try to correct the mistake.
--
====================================
carnesy: I was just asking myself when you'd post this review.
--
antiwittgenstein: There ya go. Now go buy a few ounces while it is on sale.
--
carnesy: Well I did finally get some meer bowls for my falcon stem this week. Since they're easier to unghost, I might buy an ounce and give it ago.
--
====================================
pipeandpendulum: Nice thorough review, was definitely curious about that one....
--
====================================
hello_josh: Great review. Sutfliff bulk is on sale at smokingpipes so I'm in for a few ounces!
--
====================================
SmokeOnTheWater17: You put Sleepy Hollow down as a similar tobacco. Would you say this is similar enough to merit buying in its stead? There is a big difference in price and hassle. 
--
antiwittgenstein: [My thoughts on Sleepy Hollow from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/54tvx4/tobacco_review_strauss_tobaccos_sleepy_hollow/) - the similarity is really a stretch, they are autumn themed, have some caramel notes, but Sleepy Hollow is pretty mediocre in comparison. If you like Sleepy Hollow, this is gonna be a pig poke in the eye flavor wise. 
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: Thanks. Great reviews and answered my questions. 
--
pylorns: No, its even possible pumpkin spice is used in sleepy hollow? Not sure but there is some similarity there.  I really like adding pumpkin spice as a mixer to some other tobaccos. 
--
antiwittgenstein: That is the next thing I am gonna do. I was gonna start with Pirate Kake. Got any pairings you can suggest?
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: What would be a good addition to amp up the apple? I have yet to find a good apple flavored tobacco and this might sate that itch if I can add more apple flavor to it. 
--
antiwittgenstein: The only one I have tried is DE Harvest on the Hudson which is good but a tad discontinued. I have bought but not tried McC Fresh Apple, due to this review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3nhpe4/autumn_tobacco_review_pt1_straus_sleepy_hollow/). Make sure to look at Part II of that review to see the rest of the reviews. Any more insights on apple baccy /u/TheWierdAsianKid ?
--
TheWierdAsianKid: Oh geeze, I never thought anyone would remember my reviews. Unfortunately I have stopped smoking my pipes due to health concerns, but will occasionally smoke one. I can remember McClellan Fresh Apple is definitely a good apple flavored tobacco, and I would imagine it would go great with anything pumpkin spice.


Sleepy Hollow, i would imagine, has some pumpkin spice. It's definitely a very good autumn aromatic, but I could never quite put my finger on the exact taste. 

I also apologize for never producing part three of my reviews; school got a bit busier with midterms and I got more involved with a girl who didn't agree with tobacco. 
--
antiwittgenstein: No need to apologize, you did enough to help us spend our money wisely, for that, I thank you. Every fall I go back to that set of reviews you did to see if there is something else I need to acquire, so you have no chance of being forgotten.
--
TheWierdAsianKid: Thank you very much, it means a lot from an actual reviewer. 
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: Ordered some Fresh Apple, Pumpkin Spice, and Christmas Spice. What ratio of pumpkin spice to fresh apple would you guess to start with to pump up the apple in the pumpkin spice? Of course, I will smoke them separately first but wondering what you think. 
--
antiwittgenstein: When I do this I will start about 1/4 apple. I'll let you know how it goes - and come back and inform us about all your experiments wants you produce, uh, findings. That got dry fast. 

I was wondering about that Christmas spice. Could you let us know how it is when you dip into it?
--
SmokeOnTheWater17: Will do. And I will let you know how my blending goes with the fresh apple. I also have some natural apple extract. I may try a few mls of that mixed with an ounce of Cavendish as a mixer. 
--
====================================
pylorns: 1q, butter pecan and pumpkin spice, add a little bca

mjtski: Excellent review!

misterzipp0: Always enjoy reading your reviews, another great one here.
