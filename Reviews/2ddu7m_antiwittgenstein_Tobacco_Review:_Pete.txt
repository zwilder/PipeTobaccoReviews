Review #6

**Blend Name:** Peter Stokkebye Luxury Bulls Eye Flake

**Description on Tin:** A blend of ripe Virginia tobaccos spiced with pure  Louisiana Perique. The center of Black Cavendish smooths out the taste. The  outer blend is pressed into thin layers before being tightly spun around a  stick of pressed Black Cavendish. The result is a massive ‘cigar’ which is cut  into ‘medallions’ and packed. Lightly aromatic, medium strength. Most  enjoyable on its own. Select 2 to 3 slices – rub gently by hand and fill the  pipe lightly.

**Leaf:** Half-dollar sized coins. The bullseye is black, the rings are  varigated brown and yellow, with the brown dominating.

**Tin Aroma:** Fruitcake! Golden and red raisins yes, but predominately dates, 

**Taste:** Do you like black pepper? Good. White pepper? Good. Red pepper?  Sure, why not? How about deep, rich, faintly sweet red virginia? Notes of red  wine, coffee, and cocoa cool too? Mind an occasional lemony tang from virginia  too? Swell, swell, you are going to enjoy most of this smoke. Some earthy  burley there too I hope you don't mind. What about surprises? Because there is  a chunk of cavendish waiting for you, hidden somewhere in the bowl. When you  hit it, you'll know it. The pepper mellows - but doesn't fade completely. It  becomes creamier, the virginia comes a bit forward, leaving the perique  behind. I don't really get much flavor here, but it is a great respite from  the pepper, which can get close to overwhelming. One more question, last one,I  promise. How do you like vitamin N? Because this thing has enough to press on  your Glossopharyngeal nerve like an karate chop from Optimus Prime. I am a  light weight so I will stop two or three, no, honesty here, honesty, five or  six times. If I do a two coin bowl, it usually lasts me two days. I don't know  if the smoke changes much via DGT, since I don't have the ability to smoke it  all in one go, I don't have an experimental control. 

**Smokability:** This is one flake I can actually smoke as a, you know, flake.  I sort of squish the coins into the bowl, trying not to look, so I don't know  where the cavendish center falls. It is a bear to light, but once you get it  going proper, it chugs along easily. You can also rub out or cut this up and  gravity feed it. It burns a bit easier and quicker; however, seems to lose a  bit of its character. Despite the recommendations of the manufacturer, squish  and stuff yields a much better smoke.

**Room Note:** Slightly better than a cigarette, but in the same vein.

**Thoughts:** This is the biggest bang-for-buck tobacco I have in my stable.  It is a rich satisfying smoke, with complexities and nuances to pick out. Now  it doesn't quite have the sing-song nature of the Orlik Golden Sliced, being  much more red Virignia, and having the burley in it as well. And for me, it is  a bit too powerful to smoke very often. Compared to the rest of the flakes  I have tried, it lights and smokes with ease. If you like the VaPer genre and  have a trio of bucks, you owe it to yourself to give it a go.

**Summary:** VaPer magic for a rock bottom price.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered  the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H  Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

antiwittgenstein: Hmm. I thought some of these might upset some people, but I never thought that one would do it. 

How about Unbreakable - that came close to being there instead of The Incredibles.  Happy Now?

antiwittgenstein: Ouch. I guess no movie night for us.

blenheim45: It certainly wasn't Redford and Newman.

and I like the Incredibles.  And despite my love of the comics and the character, do not want to ever see The Spirit mistreated that way again.  and The Spirit ocassionally, and Inspector Dolan constantly smoked a pipe too.

blenheim45: Seven year olds? We don't need any 7 year olds.  We enjoy the Incredibles just as we are.  LOL

but then i enjoy a good adventure story, I enjoy animation, and I enjoy that style of humor.  so i was golden from the get go, even if my nephew did not have anything to do with the film.  My nephew teaches animation and worked at the disney animation studios, first in California and then in Florida until it closed down.  Aladdin, 
Little Mermaid, Mu Lan, Lion King, Who Shot Roger Rabbit, and lots more, he worked  on a bunch of them.

Wild Bunch was probably a lot closer to the historical characters than Butch and Sundance, although you probably wouldn't want to use either film to try and teach a history course.  Much like trying to use any of the films about the James Gang or Wyatt Earp as historical portrayals...NOT. These were not nice people.

blenheim45: Only the 7 year old  probably never actually sits and "watches" it , as an adult thinks of it.  You would think that they just have it as background noise and are paying it no attention, until they quote back the dialog word for word from a scene.
With my son that role was played by the first "Teen age Mutant Ninja Turtles " Movie.

Chrisj2001: Bwahahahaha!  Burn on Samuel!!

====================================
abcdthc: How is the nic level compared to other vapers?

Escudo? Telagraph hill?  Astlys #2 or HH?
--
Darwin7848: To me it's roughly equivalent to Escudo but both are a good ways from Irish Flake.  Shouldn't set your head to spinning unless you really honk down on it hard.
--
antiwittgenstein: I haven't had any of those. Maybe a more experienced smoker can tell you.

It is about on par with 965. Twice as strong as OGS. Half as strong as Irish Flake.
--
abcdthc: I think 965 is kinda weak... :/

Good to know though, thank you :)
--
====================================
ahedderly: There's a YouTube video out there (that I can't seem to find right now) where one gentleman at the factory talks about these medallions and says that they are meant to be smoked without rubbing them out. He talks about how back in the day people would have a little sausage log of tobacco that they would just cut a slice from, fold, put in their pipe, and light up. I hope somebody finds the video, but despite the tin instructions, it seems to me that this tobacco is probably best experienced by just folding it. Now for me to order some.
--
====================================
Chrisj2001: Boy howdy I love this blend. To me, the absolute best is having it rubbed out completely, jarred for a few months, dried a good bit, and loaded up. It's good out of the bag, but aged just few months really melds it out quickly. And the price...my gawd.  So good.  And before you go there, I accept that I'll die before I master the fold and stuff.  No matter what, I focus my entire smoke trying not to let it go out/relighting.  I'm jealous of the ones it works for.
--
antiwittgenstein: Does rubbing out prior to jarring do anything particular to the maturation of the tobacco, or is this mostly a convenience step?

Like I said, this is the one (of a measly 4 attempted) flakes I can smoke flake style. OGS? Nope. Irish Flake? Uh-h. Blackwoods? You must be joking. I have to rub it out and dry it for 24 hours prior to smoking, then use a Nd:Yag laser to get to a barely smoldering stage.
--
Chrisj2001: Nothing particular as far as maturation, just convenience. 
--
Darwin7848: I hear ya.  I swear you could sit a freshly opened tin of FVF on top of a suitcase nuke, detonate it, then observe the still damp pile of flakes sneering at you.
--
====================================
Thjoth: Has anyone ever told you that you have impeccable timing?  I've been thinking about expanding my palate out of aeromatics, and I've been planning on picking up a tin of Gaslight and either Escudo or this for perique.  I've been trying to decide for a couple days now.
--
====================================
Dubhan: Bullseye Flake was an early favorite of mine, but I haven't had any in years. Now I have a hankering.

Nice review!
--
====================================
KanpaiWashi: Awesome review.  I've been meaning to get some of this tobacco, but I've just been holding out for no reason.  I'll pull the trigger soon enough. 

Also, hilarious rating system.
--
====================================
Darwin7848: Agree on almost all counts with the exception being that I smoke it two-three times a week. Despite being essentially a flake it comes darn close to ready to smoke out of the bag.   An octet of thaler's worth serves my needs for about a half dozen lunations.
--
====================================
Darwin7848: Gawith, Hoggarth has several different kinds of those sausages, they call 'em twists, that are available at SP.  I have a couple of ounces of Brown Irish X I've had a wary eye on for a while now.
