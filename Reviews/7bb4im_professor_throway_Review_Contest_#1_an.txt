Thanks to u/antiwittgenstein for motivating me to get these written up as I have been meaning to do them for a while.

Blends - John Bull Royal English (STG) & Super Value English Mixture (Sutliff)

Looking for the all day blend with some latakia? Maybe give one of these a try. They are both very mild english mixtures, light on the latakia. Both are exceptionally well balanced. Very well behaved and burn cool and at a medium pace.

**First the John Bull**

* Description on Pouch: A proper english. Combining bright Virginias and Burleys with a hint of black cavendish and smoky latakia.

* Cut: Nice ribbon. A little moist in pouch. Doesn't really dry out well so probably some PG added.

* Pouch Aroma: Smells like a light english (duh!). A little hay, and a little smoke. Sometimes a mild cocoa note but not much.

* Taste: Mild and well balanced. The latakia is very light but noticeable and there in the forefront of every puff. The VAs are the base of the blend and are typical bright VAs, hay and grass rather than bread and yeast. Some reviewers on tobaccoreviews commented on citrus notes but I didn't pick them up. The burley was really in the background, probably contributed to the general body but I didn't get any distinct burley flavors. Cavendish was noticeable but not overly strong. Oddly enough the thing that made the biggest impression on the flavor was what tastes were missing. There are no orientals here, and I tasted their absence in the same way you would taste the missing bergamot in Earl Grey tea.

* Strength: Pretty mild. More than 1Q probably about equivalent to Carter Hall. Smokeable all day.

* Smokability: Burns without issue. Easy to pack. Don't bother drying after two puff the PG will suck the moisture back out of the air. Didn't leave too much dottle or smoke wet.

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. Seems pretty inoffensive for an latakia blend.

* Thoughts: This fell really really flat for me. The absence of the orientals threw off the whole experience for me. Oddly enough I really enjoy Lancer's Slices which is just latakia and VA. Somehow that blend works but this doesn't for me. I think maybe because of the burley and cavendish I was expecting something more. The cavendish in the blend gave it a 965 like mild sweetness, so someone who really likes that profile may find this to be enjoyable. Worked better as a lawn mowing pipe than a sit and read pipe. If I wasn't thinking too much about what I was smoking I enjoyed it more

**Super Value English Mixture**

* Description on Pouch: None

* Cut: Nice ribbon. A little moist in pouch. Doesn't really dry out well so probably some PG added.

* Pouch Aroma: Smells more like a proper English blend. I can pick out the musty orientals and a little perique spice behind the latakia. Smell a faint sweet topping that is hard to place, not alcoholic.

* Taste: Very well blended. The flavor was a total melange with nothing standing out. The VA base was solid and a little sweet and hints of dried fruit. The perique also adds the dried fruit notes with some spice noticeable on the retrohale. The orientals are in the background but have enough presence that they are not missed, a little dry woodsy spice note. In the first part of the bowl I get a sweet vanilla taste which I assume is from the sweet topping. Burns off pretty quickly.

* Strength: Pretty mild. Maybe a bit stronger than the John Bull.

* Smokability: Burns without issue. Easy to pack. Always burned down to ash for me with a bit of moisture in the bowl.

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. Seems pretty inoffensive for an latakia blend.

* Thoughts: Pretty dang good for a $3 pouch. It is a proper light english mixture. Maybe more of an American English due to the sweet topping. A good all day blend.

**Comparison and Final Thoughts**
In a battle between the two the Super Value wins hands down for me. It is a nice light proper english mixture. The John Bull didn't ring any bells for me. Both cost about $4 for a 1.5 oz pouch. If there were available in 1lb bags it might be worth purchasing them. However, given that really excellent light English blends like Stokkebye Proper English are available for ~$2.25 an ounce, I will give both blends a pass in the future. They are worth a try, just don't have too high of hopes and you might be pleasantly surprised.

edit: Holy run on sentences batman.
====================================
givemeyours0ul: I've come to accept the John Bull for what it is, acceptable. My first smoke was terrible, but subsequent smokes were "okay". I'll never buy it. (It was free).

professor_throway: Yeah, I finished the pouch but never really enjoyed it much. I got it on a P&C deal, buy a pouch of John Bull, Erin Go Braugh, and Cest La Vie for $1.00 and get free shipping on your order. I gave away the aromatics but kept the John Bull out of curiosity.

antiwittgenstein: There are far too few side by sides here, this one was fun, thanks pipemate.
