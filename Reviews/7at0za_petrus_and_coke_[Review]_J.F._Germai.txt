My first attempt at a tobacco review, inspired by [this post](https://redd.it/7a133l) by u/antiwittgenstein!

**Cut:** Very fine ribbon, so fine it could be called a shag cut.

**Format:** 50g rectangular tin, moved to glass jar shortly after opening.

**Purchase Data/Price**: September 2017, from Telford's Pipe & Cigar in Mil Valley, CA. Didn't save the receipt, but I recall it being roughly $20.

**Smoked in:** For the purposes of this review, my Danish-made Stanwell Colonial 11.

**Moisture level:** Slightly wet. A few days of drying in the tin before transferring to a glass mason jar got it dried out to what feels about right to me.

**Nicotine level:** Barely perceptible to me.

**Tin note:** Upon opening the tin or jar, there's an aroma that is immediately evident from a distance that is unlike that of any other tobacco I have tried. Something fruity, almost blackberry-like. I've read some speculation that there may be a flavor from a topping or casing applied here, but no one seems to have a definitive answer, and the blend is definitely presented as a standard non-aromatic English. Regardless of whether it's an additive, or a unique characteristic of this Isle of Jersey-blended tobacco, I find the aroma to be a very pleasant one. Sticking my nose a little closer to the tin, the unusual fruity note gives way to aromas more typical of an English blend: savory, leather, earth, and a bit of that signature Latakia smokiness. On the whole the tin note is very soft and mild, and very pleasant.

**Smoking mechanics:** The fine ribbon cut packs very easily and takes a light quite easily as well. It stays burning quite well, requiring only a couple of relights as I neared the end of the bowl. The smoke is generous and rich in texture, and stays very soft and cool, even with some fairly vigorous puffing 

**Tasting note:** The smoke is medium in body, rich, but more creamy than powerful. Quite mellow, really. There is a lot of complexity to the palate of this tobacco! It's almost overwhelming to try to pick it apart. The fruitiness from the tin note is barely evident in the smoke, but the flavor is quite sweet for an English, backed just a bit of tartness - think dark chocolate-covered dried cranberry. The latakia adds a dash of smokey campfire to the mix, but not overwhelmingly so. There's a flavor and aroma note here that's different from the tin note, but also quite unique from any other blend I've tried. Something almost vegetal, but in a good way. It took me quite a bit of pondering before I finally was able to put my finger on it: fennel! Not dried fennel seeds - fresh fennel. Backed by notes of damp earth. Like a bulbous, leafy fennel plant in a garden after a fresh rain. The finish is very clean mouthwatering, and refreshing, almost grassy.

**Overall**: Excellent! If you can get your hands on a tin of this admittedly difficult to find blend, I can't recommend it enough! It may not be to everyone's tastes, but I think it's worth trying just for it's uniqueness alone. It's just so distinct from any other blend I've tried and offers a *ton* of complexity in a pleasant, easy smoke. This is easily one of my favorite blends that I've tried to date. The only thing I don't like about it is how much time and effort I'm going to inevitably spend tracking down more of it.

**A short background on me:** I've only been smoking a pipe for a few months now, so you may want to take that into account reading a review from me, but have become, perhaps, a tad obsessed with the hobby. I've already acquired and tried dozens of tobaccos and more than a handful of pipes, and I read/watch everything I can find about smoking pipes. This is my first stab at a tobacco review, but I did spend several years in the wine industry where I got accustomed to tasting from a critical perspective an writing tasting notes. If you made it this far, wow, thanks for reading!

antiwittgenstein: This is a standout first review. Fennel is certainly a unique note to find in a baccy.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Great review, wish I got my hands on a tin of that sweet sweet Germain blend.

Old_Deadhead: Excellent review! I'll definitely be on the lookout for a tin of this. 

The fennel analogy actually makes perfect sense, as it's similar to anise in aroma and many of the Germain's blends are purported to have an anise bouquet.
