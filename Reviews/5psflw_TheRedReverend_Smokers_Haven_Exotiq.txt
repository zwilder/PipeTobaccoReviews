Smokers Haven Exotique Mixture [mini-review]
By: TheRedReverend
---
I got some of this in a trade and feeling like a little oriental tobacco this evening. From the tin note, I could tell the spiciness was there. 

This comes in extremely thin ribbon and you need to take your time with it to taste the complexity. If you're into Englishes because you can get flavor while smoking too fast, this blend will frustrate you. 

Some of the notes that I got: wood, leather, hay, plum, and some sour notes. Also a little of that frankincense-like quality I noted in Bengal slices, though not as pronounced. 

The sour notes really come through as you get deeper in the bowl. I love this - Peretti's Cambridge Flake has a similar sour note I am in love with. 

What impressed me with this blend is the balance. It is extremely smooth, and incredibly well blended, which makes sense as Germain blended it. It's not going to bite your tongue and is way less spicy than the tin note. It's not a lat-bomb or a crazy over the top oriental blend. It is a symphony and not a guitar solo. This seems to be a dying art these days. 

I rate this 4.5/5. I only wish I had some perique lying around because a little bit of that would really bring this to a holy grail level. 

This can be one of the Apocryphal Gospels - it's so close to my top 4, and on a gnostic day, perhaps it even is!

chewsyourownadv: Ever try one of the crazy over-the-top Grand Oriental blends? Based on how you described this, you might like [Yenidje Highlander](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/2836/mcclelland-yenidje-highlander), or maybe its it no-latakia counterpart Yenidje Supreme. They're quite a bit more forward the component I think you described as incense-like, although it is very different in character from the topping used in Bengal Slices.

professor_throway: My favorite smoke of all time. It changes character so much based on how long you dry it, how tightly you pack. It is never bad, at least I've never had a bad smoke from it, it is just changes character so much based on the smoker. 

I agree it needs to be sipped. I think it also is best when it is a little wetter than most tobaccos. Unlike most Lat blends, it will turn ashy and burn if you go to fast. This is not a smoke while puttering in the garage or working in the yard tobacco. It is a sit on the back deck on a fall evening with a good cup of tea smoke.

Last year's /r/PipeTobacco POTY is dedicated to this blend. My personal feeling that too wide a bowl does this one no favors. It does best for me in a medium size pipe.

TheRedReverend: I started smoking it while doing yard work, stopped, and said well, I guess I have to sit and smoke now.

ChefJohnboy: This makes me happy. I live so close to Smoker's Haven!!! 
--
TheRedReverend: Lucky! I live close to Peretti's though, so I guess it's all good!

p4ttythep3rf3ct: I've been eyeballing this blend forever. Trying hard to wait to IPSD.

TheRedReverend: I know, right? An extra 10-20% off would be welcome, but I want to snag at least 4 tins.
