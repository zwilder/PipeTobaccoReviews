====================================
1402md: This was a nice surprise. I know the label mentions rum, but on opening the tin, I was more aware of a liqueur. There's a certain citrus presence I associate with Grand Marnier. The citrus came out again on lighting up. I'm not a devotee of the separate and fold approach to flake. I typically like to cube cut a flake, however, tonight I chose to give the 'baccy a good rub. I believe that was a wise choice. This flake was most noteworthy for maintaining a consistent flavor from the char to the dottle. As full-bodied as I could wish with the liqueur note always in the background. It's a cool burner and tends to go out about halfway down the bowl. The surprise is the taste stays uniform with every relight.  I'm using a filtered cob I've only smoked once. I am deeply impressed with the blending elves at Pease. This is a complex mostly Virginian that they have really dressed up. The room note was mild and fairly light. I will score this three and a half stars because to give a higher score, Kate Upton would have to pack the bowl for me.

DankPipes: Nice review!  I procrastinated and let the time slip by before acquiring a tin.  It sounds like a solid blend so it will be in a future order for sure!  Thanks for the review.
--
soymilkisgood: You can still write a review, there's no cut off date ;)
--
DankPipes: I got a tin in my most recent purchase :) 
--
crimblade: I ordered it back in September from P&C, it's still backordered...
--
1402md: Weird. I ordered mine on from Smoking Pipes dotcom on Black Friday and had it on Thursday 12/1. P&C needs to get it together.
--
misterzipp0: I'm smoking my initial bowl of this and got the same uniform taste throughout.  Curious as to the age of your tin?  Mine was 12/5/16 so barely 2 weeks old.  Age will help some complexity come out but I found the base flavor similar to The Virginia Cream without the topping or the roughness.
--
1402md: My can is dated 9/28/16. My understanding is GLP age beautifully, so I'm sure you're right.

====================================
givemeyours0ul: Well, so far this was not for me. I've had four bowls. The first was dried to crispy in my Virgina Flake pipe. I dried it more than intended and did an air pocket, then I didn't manage to smoke it for almost two days. I got some great Virgina flavors on the first half. The second half was smothered with the ashy flavor I associate with Dark Fired. Bitey throughout.  
The second and third bowls were in a fairly new small bowled pipe that has been a good smoker. I'm still trying to determine what blends are best in it. This sure wasn't it. The second bowl was dried "correctly", the third not enough. Ashy from start to finish, no Virgina sweetness or flavor at all, lots of bite.  
My final bowl was in another deep bowled pipe, one I usually use for light English blends, but it's not dedicated by any means. Dried to the springy side of crispy. Virgina sweetness was present in a mild way throughout, the sight lingering Latakia ghost added some interesting notes. Still quite ashy. No bite this time.  
I am starting to think that Dark Fired just isn't my thing. I love it in dry cured cigars, but not so much in pipe tobacco. Also, I think the Virginias are really really green. I'm going to jar the rest and wait a year. I think this blend will be much improved with some age.  
As for the "drop" of rum, I never found it in the smoke, although it added to the tin note for certain.

chewsyourownadv: That ashy taste is what I associated with dark fired for a long time, and I stepped away from it figuring it just wasn't for me. Maybe a year after that, I got curious again, knowing my palate had shifted around a little. Someone sent me a sample of Newminster Superior Round Slices, and it just suddenly clicked for me. There was this great tobacco with little hints of hickory barbecue sauce in it, and it was the first time I really "got it." Maybe dark fired just doesn't sit well with you right now; might be worth revisiting a blend that has just a little in the future though, who knows?
--
givemeyours0ul: Yep! It's in the jar, I'll come back to it in a year or so. The Virginias will have improved, and I might like DF more by then.
--
mgvsquared: I tried this in two of my Virginia pipes. Once rubbed out, once cube cut. I got better flavor and burn time out of the cube. Try that if you get the motivation to do so. I'm just not a navy-style-lover. I never tasted the rum specifically.

All that being said, I'll jar and cellar to see how it ages.

Have you tried Mac Baren ODF? I don't love Mac Baren flakes, TBH. They rub out funny and cube cut very chunkily, BUT, ODF was the best experience I've had with Dark Fired. Well...Sixpence is really nice too. Probably the best out of the Old London series IMO.
--
givemeyours0ul: I have ODF but I haven't cracked it, I don't want to be disappointed.

====================================
misterzipp0: Not doing a "proper" review on this one because both it and I need more time.  My tin came in as a mere child at just shy of 3 weeks old.  The smell in the tin is a slight liqueur note that occasionally finds its way into the smoke.  The dominant taste is all Virginia and it doesn't stray much from it.

Occasionally I'll get some umami from the room note and side stream that's akin to the way fat on a well seared ribeye tastes but it's fleeting.  I smoked this in 3 different pipes and by far the best was my poker that sees manly DF blends.  The narrow bowl helped intensify the flavors in the VA and allowed me to get *some* hickory from the DF but none of the maple sweetness I prefer.  I also tried this in a Sav 320 and it made this blend fall completely flat, even in "flake" form.  I did get a slight catch in my throat from the DF in all 3 pipes and the retrohale brought out some nice spice but not much else.  

I'd be interested to see what kind of rum they use here as most rums have lots of added sugar and that could contribute to some of the burn with this one as my tongue was a bit raw even after being gentle with it.

This blend has potential but I'm honestly getting tired of receiving blends from C+D that don't have at least a few months to a year on them and then having to age them myself.

The quality in their product is evident and each blend hints at what it will become but sometimes the raw tobacco taste is too much, especially in a primarily VA blend, and I'm forced to revisit it.

Sadly I get one color from this blend: grey. That's a shame as I've been looking forward to trying it for so long.  My expectations might have been too high as I truly thought this would have a deeper taste.  The nicotine on this one is quite high as well and I had to set the last bowl aside even after a turkey dinner.

For now this one gets a 2.5 from me and it's going to the back of the cellar for at least a year.

claypainter: Alright, I haven't done one of these in a while because few of the community review blends have really interested me. However, I saw this at a local B&M and picked up a tin. So here it goes.  
  
**Blend Name:** Navigator

**Description on Tin:** A bit melodramatic like most G.L. Pease tins but not over the top: *For centuries, men of the sea have known the pleasures of fine Virginia tobaccos, pressed and aged with a drop of rum. The addition of rich dark-fired Kentucky leaf brings a new dimension to the flavour and aroma of this timeless combination. Chart your course for a new world of enjoyment, light a bowl, and set sail with Navigator.*  
  
**Leaf:** It says that it is VA based with DFK. Delicate to broken flake. It also has a rum topping and maybe something else (cocoa), but it is subtle...  
  
**Tin Aroma:** Smell sweet, dark fruit, and caramel.  
  
**Taste:** The taste is gentle. The rum prickle is present but it does not bite and it is not in the forefront. I taste stewed fruits and caramel and cocoa. Nothing jumps to the front as a big player. The DFK is very restrained, but in the second half of the bowl you start to get some of the deeper spice and woodsiness, but again, subtle.  
  
**Smokability:** This lights well, the flakes are delicate and broken - easy to rub out. You could dry it for a small amount of time or just light it up.  
  
**Room Note:** Fairly pleasant.  
  
**Thoughts:** If you are a beer lover, I would compare this to a well-crafted and restrained brown ale. It isn't an over-the-top exciting beer with bold strong flavors, but it is a comforting pint that you can enjoy on any given day.  
I may be way off, but I feel like it has similarities to MacBaren Mixture Scottish Blend - but with less bite, less topping, a stronger tobacco backbone, and more nicotine.  
I liked it.
  
**Recommend to:** People who like a middle-of-the-road tobacco with a decent nicotine and don't mind a tiny splash of topping. If you like, MacBaren Navy Flake, Scottish Blend, and other similar tobaccos, I think that this would be right up your alley.  
  
**Summary:** 3 out of 4 stars, for me. I would buy it again, I enjoy it, and can see myself reaching for it a decent amount.
  
**My Background:** I like VaPers VaBurs and DFK, I enjoy Englishes but milder ones and Balkans.
