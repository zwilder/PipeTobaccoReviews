Review: Tsuge Ryujin- The Dragon God
By: PastorPuff

Component Tobaccos: Bright Virginia, Acadian Perique and Latakia 

Cut: Course Ribbon

Tin Note: Campfire smoke hits me in the face with underlying notes of vinegar and sugar. 

Body: 8/10

Strength: 8/10

Nic: 6/10, sometimes this hit me hard on a full stomach, others it was fine even on an empty stomach.. so your mileage may vary.

Moisture From Tin: A little wet, but still smoke-able. 

Mechanics: Smokes fine, no complaints. Cool, dry and easy smoking.

Taste: 

At first this is a very sweet and smoky blend. The perique is peppery and begins to tickle the throat very early on, after just a few puffs. An acrid flavor begins to develop, it plays nice with the sweetness coming off of the Virginia. There is a lot of perique in this blend, almost to the point of overpowering. 

The latakia starts to fade toward the halfway point in the bowl. The perique starts to become more figgy and the throat tickle is intense. I lose the Virginias. Occasionally I think I taste some grass or a bit of sweetness, but it's fleeting. I believe that they are helping greatly to balance this perique. What I have is a battle between the figgy, peppery perique and the cool, smoky latakia.

Thoughts:

I was really looking forward to trying this blend and the rest of the 'God' line from Tsuge, as I really enjoyed Raijin. This blend was a bit of a let down in that regard. It's not as complex and I was hoping for a level of complexity and depth. They were going for a full bodied English blend, and they (kinda) accomplished that, but by sacrificing what makes an English blend an English blend. 

One of my biggest problems with traditional English blends is that they tend to lack body, body's not a problem here. As I said they accomplished the body goal. However, the latakia is not prominent enough to scratch that English itch. And this is my problem with this blend. I pick up an English blend for that nice smoky, leathery latakia flavor; maybe with a bit of sweetness from Cavendish or spice from a bit of perique. The perique is just too overpowering.

That's not to say it's all bad. The Virginias are great. They provide a nice balance to the perique and while the latakia is dialed back, it is still very good. 

Overall: 6.5/10

====================================
FreestateFreehand: Thanks for this...I ordered a bunch of Tsuge on a whim and have yet to try any, and I'm hesitant to crack any since I have *soo* many other blends to try first. I was actually thinking about this particular blend earlier today...nice little surprise to come home to this great write-up!

PastorPuff: Not a problem. 

I did a write up of [Raijin](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/65fmnv/review_tsuge_raijin/) several months ago and decided to go through the whole line. I'll be posting reviews of the final two in their God line in the next month or so.
