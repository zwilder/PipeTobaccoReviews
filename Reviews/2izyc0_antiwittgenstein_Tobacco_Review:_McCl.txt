Review #10

**Blend Name:** McLelland No. 2010 Classic Virginia

**Description on Tin:** No. 2010 Classic Virginia is aptly named, and this has become a standard-bearer for those who enjoy a Virginia flake but hate the high cost of tins. Flue-cured tobaccos from yellow to light red are combined and pressed to develop the natural flavor of the leaf. It's then sliced for easy preparation. It's great right out of the pouch and becomes sublime with age.

**Leaf:** Walnut colored broken flakes. Lots of small splinters in there.

**Tin Aroma:** Whataburger Ketchup. Dried fruits. Soy sauce. The fruit rollups they sold during the eighties, the kind that was just a flat dark purple circle that tasted like figs and grapes, and sometimes had seeds and fibers in it.

**Taste:** Bursts open with a juicy Virginia sweetness. Citrus and dark fruits, with a spicy undercurrent. Pine. I am amazed I did not ever realize this before, but part of the classic ‘Virginia’ taste, is Pine, not like pinesap, but woody, with that piney aroma, like how pine needles should taste. It is extremely pronounced here, but thinking back to the Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and the Peter Stokkebye Flakes, I believe this was hidden away in those as well. Rich tobacco. Black pepper. Floral. Maybe I should amend that to Tellicherry pepper instead? Sweet and woody. Even when I am getting just whisps of smoke, it is extremely full flavored. Towards the end it becomes steadily more peppery, but the fruit-citrus-pine taste is pretty consistent even into the ashy dregs.

It has some strength. At least for my rubbery legs. You might not find yourself ghosting, but I had to put it down a few times. I am not sure if the DGT effect is present, because I usually take a whole afternoon to smoke the whole bowl.

**Smokability:** Standard flake behavior. I cube cut it and let it dry for a few hours. Harder to light and keep lit than many other flakes, but is gasoline compared to Blackwoods.

**Room Note:** Virginia tobacco. That means like very elegant cigarettes. Pretty woodsy. Of course I am also doing carpentry today, so that might be the sawdust in the air.

**Thoughts:** I had bought this around June, smoked it once, gave it a hearty meh and shelved it. In my trade, my partner wanted Virginia aplenty so I saw this, dumped out half of what I had into a bag, and sent it away. Since it was opened I decided to smoke it, to see if it was any better. I immediately regretted being so generous. After just 5 months in a tin it developed into a complex, satisfying smoke that hits all the notes I want from a Va flake. This is the closest thing to ‘aged’ tobacco I have had yet, and shows that it doesn’t take years or decades to improve tobacco. 

I bought this because I liked the Blackwoods so much, but wanted a tobacco with flammability. Internet rumor has it that this is the same tobacco, but that Blackwoods is aged for a full 5 years. Now that the 2010 has some time on it, it is definitely pushing towards the same taste profile. Not quite as intense, not as full or varied, but quite enjoyable. More to the point, it fires like the Hindenburg in comparison. I have closed it up again, and will try it out again at the full year mark. I will let y’all know if there are any other signs of development.

**Summary:** A satisfying citrus-fruit-pine Virginia flake, once you let it age for a few months.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 8 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

peckinpahhombre: Try smoking Dark Star.  You would have better luck setting fire to chunks of asbestos.  Sublime once lit though.

Darwin7848: Know what you mean about Blackwoods' lack of combustibility.  It's very tasty but I felt as if I needed to buy carbon credits after I finished a bowl.  Only a junk drawer pipe and a torch cigar lighter made any real impression on it.  What is it with McClelland flakes?  Do they use an asbestos casing?  2015 seems no more willing to stay lit than its Blackwoods sibling.  Perhaps I've tried the only two outliers.

greenguitarist8: This was probably one of the first blends I tried when I was just starting out. My dad feel in love with it.  He also mixes it with an Irish Whiskey blend.

crimsonrat: Great review. And bravo on the rating scale. I think one of these needs to integrate flat earth society one day...

ivyshaft: I rubbed and dried my Blackwoods for about 8 hours with the fan on in summer. Shit "burns like gas" as you have put it. Tastes great too. Actually one of the best burning tobaccos I have. Only 5 matches for an hour of smoking. I usually use fifteen. The other day I used fifty.
