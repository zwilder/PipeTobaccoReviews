Tobacco Review: Strauss Tobacco's Sleepy Hollow
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 77

**Blend Name:** Strauss Tobacco’s Sleepy Hollow
 
**Description on Tin:** N/A

**Leaf:** Crumbly, darkish mottled short leaf
 
**Tin Aroma:** Sweet, caramel, chocolate, rich earth, coffee, chicory, raisins, cherry chocolates, nougat, marshmallow, taffy, peanut brittle – just think of sticking your head into your candy bag at the end of Halloween night.

**Taste:** Well well. Sweet Caramel. Fairly strong flavoring for an aromatic too, at least when you get your cadence just right, then the flavor is in every puff. And, sweet caramel. I hope and hope for some development but… hey, about 3/4s of the way through a bit of maple. Yes, not hugely different, but different. And some maybe funnel cake, though it is more the cloud of smoke I puff around me influencing my tastebuds. Not a hint of tobacco anywhere.

**Nicotine:** 1-2.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** Like any aromatic, this takes a deft hand, luck, blood sacrifice, and the cooperation of the elements to burn just right, but I was somehow able to get it close to right every time – and I am a very infrequent aromatic smoker. That means they are doing something right. Even after a 3 hour lay out it still felt moist to the touch, but it didn’t resist the flame and it needed only the occasional relight. Little to no tongue bite as long as you smoke cold and slow.
 
**Room Note:** I smoked this outside – a crime I know – but I bathed myself in the smoke clouds. It has a wonderful funnel cake stand smell to it. 

**Thoughts:** This is one of the more famous shop tobaccos, and one of the more famous Autumn themed ones – how does it live up to its reputation? It is a pretty good aromatic. I think it captures a piece of the American Autumnal odorscape, but just a piece. It smokes remarkably well, but… of the three autumnal aromatics I have had, Sleepy Hollow, C&D Autumn Evening and Sutliff Taste of Autumn, I prefer this one the least. Again take that with the caveat knowing I am no great aromatic aficionado, I smoke them the least of all the food groups. [Autumn Evening](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3oe20b/tobacco_review_cornell_and_diehl_autumn_evening/) has a similar taste, but hewing closer to maple the caramel, but has real tobacco underneath. [Taste of Autumn](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3s1s1d/tobacco_review_sutliff_taste_of_autumn/) is more pumpkin spice latte with some Virginia flavors mixed in as well. Sleepy Hollow is one of the better aromatics, yes, but remember you also have to order this – egads –over the phone, talking to an actual human being.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Autumn Evening, Seven Seas Regular, Captain Black Royal
 
**Summary:** A sweet caramel-maple-funnel cake aromatic with a room note to match.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2.5 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+

Rating system (interpreted through the signs of fall):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (That first cold crisp day)

(++++) Great (Autumn Leaves – the actually leaves, though the song is nice too)

(+++) Very good (Football)

(++) Good (Hiking season returns)

(+) I think like it (Baseball playoffs)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Pumpkin spice everything!)

(-) I think I dislike this (Rememberences of having to go back to school)

(--)This is not for me (Getting stuck in school traffic)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Fall allergies)

(----)This is suffering (Drunk college kids – it is 1:17 AM on a Tuesday, get it together you souses!)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (School shooting season commences)

Thanks again to /u/ImherefortheH1Z1 for the sample!

boomermax: I have some SH if you are up for a trade

antiwittgenstein: Haunted bookshop is phenomenal - I don't think I would put it under the 'autumn' blend rubric, but it is hands down my favorite burley blend. It is big, tasty, complex, and will have you throwing up in your utensil drawer if you aren't careful.

erkpik: No, thats Old Joe Krantz which will have you heaving.
--
antiwittgenstein: With C&D you even have to watch out for the nic hit on their aros.

drakemcguff: Sweet lord.
