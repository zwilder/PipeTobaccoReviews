After much hesitation... Mixture 79

From my recent [mail call](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/5t45lx/mail_call_or_how_1_dollar_at_pc_turned_into/)  
  
Comment from me in that post:
"Oh my god, it's licorice!"  
     
From u/G_Peccary : "I once restored a pipe that had 79 smoked out of it. It smelled like flowers and baby powder."  
  
From P&C:  
*Eric's Staff Pick - "If your Dad was like mine, there was always a can of Mixture No. 79 sitting next to his favorite chair. I enjoyed the unique aroma of anice and vanilla as his smoke filled the room. Thanks for the priceless memory!"  
  
To Eric: Pics or it didn't happen. Also, it's spelled "anise".  
  
Mixture 79 is a Sutliff product sold in pouch and jar. **It is Burley. And Burley. Also, Burley. Then for some reason a git dropped a licorice into it.**
  
When I opened the pouch I had flashbacks to being at a Chuck E Cheese for the first time as a kid. I bit into a slice of sausage pizza and something bit back. It was my first deadly encounter with a Fennel seed. To this day, fennel seeds make me gag. Anise also generally triggers that reaction.  
  
**So this was a smoke I was a bit scared of. I really didn't want to puff Anise.**  
  
But I did it anyway.

I decided to light this in the Panama Jack (aka, Missourri Meerschaum Marcus) I got from the same mail call. I decided that if it somehow ruined the pipe in one smoking I could bury it in the neighbors yard and not feel like I lost something valuable.  
  
**This was a smoke I was prepared to hate, toss away, and burn the memories of.**  
  
Verdict: It smokes like burley with a bit of added flavor. The anise flavoring didn't carmelize into condensed licorice smell/taste. It was just tastey burley. The smoke didn't at all seem to have the anise aroma either. **It was pleasant actually.** If Eric wasn't making up that story about his dad, I get who this is for...  
  
Who is this for? **If you like the smell of licorice, and you enjoy burley; you will probably enjoy** taking a big whiff from the pouch/container before lighting this up and enjoying it.    
  
I have no doubt that if you smoked this often enough it would leave a traces in a pipe. I had a small bowl of Carter Hall in the Cob afterwards and didn't have a hint though.   
  
This blend seems to have many people who hate it, and that's fine. Not every bag of tea is for everyone either. After manning up and trying it though, I have to say:  
a. it's a smoke  
b. it wasn't bad   
c. it was actually pleasant, a nice Sunday afternoon pipe, and a nice surprise  
  
I wouldn't go out of my way to smoke it over my normal smoke choices, but I feel good that I got over my anise/fennel/licorice-phobia and tried this.

Fuzzy_Totemz: I don't like Licorice!*  
  
*Except on Burley apparently
--
Pipezilla: I love me some licorice... is it any good?  Gotta get some on my next order.
--
professor_throway: Still haven't managed to try ramsgate but it is supposed to be pretty good. 

Dark Flake Liquorice is very good, but like regular Dark Flake it can be rough. The sweetness from the topping smooths it out some, the flavor is pretty subtle and has a bit of Lakeland essence.

jb270: Thanks for the review, I feel like I should take advantage of these pouch sales when they come up. I'm also curious to know your thoughts on the melon one when you get around to it. 
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Short review.  
  
They forgot the flavoring on the melon tins. In addition, the base tobaccos were nothing to write home about. It... sucked...  
  
And this coming from a guy who smoked toxic grape and mix79...
--
jb270: I'll admit I had a morbid curiosity about it but had a feeling it would be crap. If it tasted like melon shisha it would be fun as a novelty smoke once and a while.

saxophonefartmaster: I always thought Mixture 79 tasted like a toss-up of old lady perfume and urinal cake. But hey, as long as you enjoy it.
