Video Review of Tsuge's blend "Ryujin: The Dragon God"

====================================
JCelsius: **Blend Name:** Ryujin: The Dragon God

**Description on Tin:** Not for the meek or faint of heart, the breath from this dragon will fly you to an alternate reality. Nothing traditional about this blend or Drew Estate - it is innovative, powerful, and will slam you to the ground with a smile. The combination of Latakia, Virginia leaf tips, and exotic Acadian black tobacco are combined in a perfect harmony but don't let the smooth aroma fool you, it's a creeper.

**Leaf:** Ribbon cut. The Acadian black is very prevalent.

**Tin Aroma:** Smoky with a slight almost floral fragrance. 

**Taste:** It's definitely an English. The Latakia is prevalent but it's not what I'd call a Lat-bomb. It's a fairly smooth smoke, at first, although I wouldn't call it mellow. It's full bodied for sure. What I assume is the Acadian black tobacco gives it a slight twang but I emphasize the world "slight". Just enough to give it a unique taste I would say.

**Nicotine:** When the tin says it's a creeper, it means it. The smooth smoke will fool you into thinking it's a light hitter, but it packs a solid punch. If you're like me, you're going to want to keep a little water handy to keep vitamin-N at bay. It's not the strongest blend I've smoked by far, and some of you may find it doesn't affect you too much, but for me it's nothing to be scoffed at.

**Smokability:** I didn't have to let it dry at all. It comes pretty much perfect in the tin. It packs well and stays lit better than a lot of other tobaccos. There's not really much more you could ask for. I usually smoke down halfway through a large bowl and relight it and it stays lit the second time as well.

**Room Note:** No complaints from my wife or her grandparents when we visited. I believe it may have smelled a little smokey or peppery because it made her grandmother sneeze, but she said she enjoyed the smell.

**Thoughts:** Well I loved it. As I said in the video, the biggest downside to me was the price. A tin was $12 at my tobacconist and that seems to be around the going price online. Because of that fact, it probably won't be an every day smoke, but rather a little treat now and again but I do plan on keeping a tin handy if I can help it! I also fully intend on trying at least the other English in this series "Raijin: God of Thunder". I may even try Gunjin: God of Samurai (VA blend) and Fujin: God of Wind (Perique heavy or so I hear) even though I'm not a big VA smoker.

**Summary (TL;DR):** A full and smooth English blend with a unique accent to it and quite a bit of nicotine.

**Score:** 5/5

**My Background:** I've been smoking a pipe for several years and I smoke several times a day. I smoke almost exclusively English blends nowadays, but I have been known to enjoy some Orlik Golden Slice and a couple other VA blends. Among English blends, I'd say my favorites are Blue Mountain, GL Pease Odyssey, and Frog Morton on the Town. 

Hope you enjoyed the review!

talltree2011: Awesome review man, I was debating on picking some up since it was on sale on SmokingPipes. I think you may have sold me!

JCelsius: Thank you much. I hope you like it as much as I did! I was pleasantly surprised.

LegesAequitas: Thanks for the review! I don't hear about Acadian black tobacco very much at all. It sounds a good bit like perique (especially in the strength department) except the lack of peppery taste.
--
JCelsius: Yeah, I hadn't had much exposure to it myself before or if I had I hadn't paid much attention to it. I think it's safe to say I enjoyed it though.
--
LegesAequitas: Sounds good. I'll have to look into trying blends with it as a component.
