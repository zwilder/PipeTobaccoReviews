[Tobacco Review] Mac Baren Vanilla Cream loose cut

**Blend Name:** Mac Baren Vanilla Cream (Creme) loose cut

**Description on Tin:** N/A; bought in bulk. This blend is also offered in tins, but I did not pick one up.

**Leaf:** Bright virginia with a healthy mix of black cavendish; probably a half and half between the two. This blend comes in a flake and in this cut which appears to be the flake ready rubbed; bits of flake are visible in the mixture. 

**Tin Aroma:** Strong odor of vanilla and sugar; it smells a lot like vanilla saltwater taffy but much stronger. There's a hint of something vaguely alcoholic about the scent too... Like a bad pina colada or a bottle where rum once lovingly slept. 

**Taste:** Pure sugar on the char. As the blend calms down it mellows into a competent but much sweeter, thanks to the cavendish and the flavoring, virginia. The vanilla is not as potent in flavor as you might expect from the tin note, but this is typical for cased tobaccos. The vanilla top notes combined with burning leaf produce an almost vanilla cake like flavor with a constant reminder of just how delightfully sweet the blend is. This is an aromatic that manages to taste how it claims, and to me that is an achievement worth noting, not to mention the sweetness goes fantastically with a cup of coffee. It seems to lose the sweet vanilla note as the bowl goes down and ends in a sweet smoke that is just vaguely reminiscent of vanilla by the dregs of the bowl. The retrohale is **NOPE** the sweetness and silky vanilla is completely lost and this blend falls horrible flat through the nose. 

**Smokability:** For my tastes, this blend needed a little drying time, but not nearly as much as some other unmentionable aros which come packed in syrup. The blend smokes surprisingly cool in comparison to others in its wheelhouse; after getting a nice light I enjoyed this blend without suffering even the slightest bite, but I was careful about my pacing. I did not notice any variation in the volume of smoke between this any other blends; all seems quite normal. My suggestion is to pack this blend carefully and looser than you think you need to; it doesn't like being confined. Let me reiterate that you should not retrohale this blend; it loses all of its good characteristics and actually irritated my sinuses (which no other blend Va/English/Balkan/Burley has ever done to me). 

**Room Note:** Vanilla. What were you expecting? It smells like vanilla. This is a crowdpleaser for sure. 

**Thoughts:** This is a great aromatic and easily the best one I've ever smoked, but I realized after a 3 bowls that I do not enjoy this style of tobacco as much as I did when I began smoking a little over a year ago.

**Recommend to:** Aromatic smokers or people looking for something sugary to fill their pipes with. 

**Summary:** Sweet and vanilla; directly as described. If you're not an aro fan then this is probably unlikely to change your mind.

**My Background:** I've tried a lot of tobaccos from aros to englishes in my past year of being a piper. My current favorites are Erinmore Flake, Full Virginia Flake, Stonehaven, and Carter Hall. I prefer Virginias over Englishes nine times out of ten and I stray from latakia heavy mixes.
====================================
pylorns: Great review, I'd add that the vanilla cream flake is truly where it's at as far as this blend is concerned.

LordHector: I agree with /u/pylorns regarding the flake. Only pipe tobacco I've ever smoked where a lady said "That smells really good."

It's one of the aromatic tobaccos I really enjoy as a change of pace.

====================================
None: Constantly come back to this blend when I'm drinking. Everyone likes the smell, I can drunkenly smoke multiple bowls without tongue bite no matter how overly hot I get my pipe (again super drunk), and to top it off my wife loves how I smell in the morning after I've had a few bowls. ;)
