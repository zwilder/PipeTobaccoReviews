Review: Mac Baren Navy Flake

**Blend Name:** Mac Baren Navy Flake

**Tin Description:** A mild flake blended from the finest Burley tobaccos with added ripe Virginias and Cavendish. Navy Flake is light burning, making the lighting of the pipe very easy.

**Leaf:** Burley, Cavendish, Virginia

**Appearance:** Flake tobaccos with medium and light colored tobaccos evenly distributed throughout. Moistness is good – not too sopping wet like some other flakes (SG being the main offender there).

**Tin Aroma:** Sweet Virginia aroma with a bit of hay and grassiness. A vaguely sweet flavor (honey? Caramel? Molasses?) is present as well, making it an altogether pleasant smelling flake. Mild, but pleasant.

**Taste:** A light Virginia taste with a touch of sweetness from the added topping. It burns well after being slightly rubbed out – I have also tried it by folding in half and stuffing with the ends up, which I find provides a nicer flavor but not as nice a burn. Getting down the bowl a bit, the nuttiness from the burley comes out and gives the blend a little bit of a backbone. This blend doesn’t have much spice, but then again I expected it to be exceedingly mild, which it is. I’m especially happy about the back seat the topping seems to take, allowing the Virginias and burleys to come to the forefront. But the honey-like sweetness is definitely still there.

**Strength and Nicotine:** Fine nicotine amount that is about medium, and the strength is mild. Easy to smoke and smoke and smoke… 

**Smokeability:** Perfectly smokeable all day long. This blend is one that I would enjoy sitting around and puffing at all day. Doesn’t bite like some Mac Baren blends can, which I appreciate. Loads and burns easily. No fuss and pleasant taste. Good stuff.

**Room Note:** Pleasant room note with the same sweetness and vague grassy/hay like qualities from the smoke. Nice to be around.

**Thoughts:** A tasty VaBur flake that has some light topping for interest. This is not something that will knock your socks off with taste or flavor, but it doesn’t make you expect that out of it. It’s all about sitting back and enjoying some mild, sweet flavor that you can sit and puff at all day. 

**Recommend to:** An aromatic smoker that wants to dip their toe into something a bit more on the non-aromatic side, a non-aromatic smoker who would like something sweeter for themselves or their guests, someone who wants to sit back with a tin and put flake after flake in their pipe and smoke it for a while.

**Summary:** A pleasant topped VaBur blend that I’d be glad to have fill my pipe for an all-day smoke. You will too.

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a few months ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and have been receiving gratis Sutliff products in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is one of many that I'll be doing as part of the program.

====================================
CurlyFatAngry: Thanks for the review, just curious how do you normally gauge the nicotine content in a tobacco?

soymilkisgood: How it affects me. So it is subjective, but there's no other way to really do it unfortunately.

lostarchitect: This was one of the first pipe tobaccos I ever smoked. It's my friend's father's main smoke, so I thought I'd try it. I didn't really care for it back then, but I wonder if my taste has developed so that I might now appreciate it. I'll have to check it out again. Thanks for the reminder.

Itsm00: It was my second tobacco ever, and my first flake. Still have part of that first tin jarred for sentimental reasons.

That was my first flake tobacco. As a new-ish pipe smoker (about 1.5 years) it was a really pleasent smoke and easy to handle too. I just folded it and put in my pipe, and it was the first time I wasn't relighting all the time ;-)
