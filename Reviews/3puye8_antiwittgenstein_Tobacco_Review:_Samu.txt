Review #53

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith Medium Virginia Flake

**Description on Tin:** A bit lighter in strength than Full Virginia Flake, but the flavor more than makes up the difference. It's lightly sweet taste comes from the natural sugars found in Virginia leaf. This flake is also well suited for blending with other, stronger tobaccos to round out the flavor and add complexity.
 
**Leaf:** Thick, broken light tan flake
 
**Tin Aroma:** Oatmeal, raisins, hay, citrus, nutmeg, cinnamon, nutty, sourdough bread
 
**Taste:** Lemons and hay. Vinegar, sour but a bit sweet. Oatmeal and sweet buttered bread. The lemon flavor is so dominate I suspect that it is a casing, just like MacBaren Va No. 1. Dried roses and musk. Mouth filling flavor, mostly bright citrus-vinegar, a tempering sweetness, with salty-savoury flavors at the sides of the mouth, growing in the long afterglow.  This is the kind of tobacco that you will keep tasting right into your next puff. A bit of white pepper, but it is fairly tame. Raspberry jam. Some kind of darker fruit, but not plummy like its big brother. Toasted tobacco. Lemonade. Lemon bars. Lemon soup. Lemon ala king. I am glad it is warm again because this meets a summery day, a glass of iced tea, with say a tome concerning the Civil War. Oatmeal and hay again. And sweet lemon curd.

**Nicotine:** Medium. I feel relaxed but I can still feel my toes.

**Smokability:** Compared to Full Virginia Flake, this stuff is thermite. That means it is smokable. Dry it out some. Can bite a bit.
 
**Room Note:** Toasted tobacco with a touch of lemon. Definitely cased.

**Thoughts:** I can still remember my first bowl of this. I was going to my friend’s going away bbq and I smoked this one the way over there. I stopped this as soon as I lit it so was I taken with the flavor. If you have a hard time getting clear flavors from Virginia flakes, give this one a whirl. 

So of course this review wouldn’t be anything if I didn’t talk about that other, more famous flake: MacBaren Virginia No. 1. It is quite similar, but better, bigger, more complex, and more satisfying. I liked the Va No. 1, but this is the unabridged edition. This is one place where my beloved 11 point scale fails. I think this is a solid +++, but so was the No. 1 – but this one is clearly better. But it is not well rounded enough to catch the ++++.

Oh, I guess I should talk about Full Virginia Flake too? These have different profiles, but both have the same blending ideology: focus on one flavor and pound the hell out of it. FVF is plums all the way down. MVF is lemons, lemons galore. As an inveterate Virginia smoker, I enjoy both of them, and both of them are great at what they do, but they fall well short of perfection with that single mindness. I have a tin of FVF waiting the snows and ice and seasonal depression. When I open it, I will mix the two of these and hopefully, I can get everything I want out of a Virginia session. You know, Orlik Golden Sliced.

**Similar Tobaccos:** MacBaren Virginia No. 1, Comoy’s Cask No. 1, Drew Estate Gatsby Flake

**Summary:** A sweet, complex, full flavored lemonade style Virginia Flake.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.
