[Review] Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. Glengarry Flake

My second attempt at reviewing so go easy on me. Again I'd like to volunteer as tribute in your Review Games u/antiwittgenstein. 

Appearance: Long, brown Gawith flakes with lighter and darker browns interspersed throughout.

Jar Aroma: Honey, very light Lakeland essence, dried fruit.

Taste: Honey & heather. Haylike Virginia's but lacking the piquancy I normally associate with bright Va's. Velvety smooth and creamy. Typical Lakeland essence at first which waned quickly into soft, warm honey notes and subtle sweetness that is quite pleasant and in no way cloying. More like an immediately post-menopausal woman who hasnt fully taken on the granny scent. Dont get me wrong, she's pinching children's cheeks and sometimes wears a house dress, but she hasn't yet begun keeping Werther's Originals around the house or getting the walking farts at the grocery. On retrohale more Lakeland, but again it's faint and pleasant. Some cereal/oat undertones. Very consistent taste throughout bowl. Pairs incredibly well with tea, hot or cold, especially green tea. 

Burn: After rubbing out and drying for 30 min, it burned easy and down to the bottom of the bowl with minimal relights. 

Strength/Body: Medium

Nicotine: Mild

Room Note: Very pleasant. My family said it "smelled like Christmas" which was baffling to me but much better than their typical "smells cigarette-y" or "smells like a tire factory burned to the ground". 

Rating: 3.5/4

Thoughts: Great introduction to Lakeland blends as it provides the typical Gawith essence, but in a more moderated expression than a blend like Ennerdale Flake. I find that I am reaching for this more and more often because of how well it smokes and the great room note. It's quite similar to Luxury Twist Flake, another of my go-to's, but with a bit more creaminess in the smoke. I would highly recommend this blend for anyone who's looking to try out a Lakeland blend but is wary of the "soapiness" or "granny panties" scent.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Good review, but I still don't know if I have the guts to get me some lakelands... heard too many ghost stories

JetLife794: Thanks! If you're really apprehensive at all, this is the one for you. It has enough Lakeland essence for you to know it's there, but very muted compared to others. I've even smoked it in 2-3 of my briars with no ghosting. If you're ever feeling adventurous just add an oz to one of your orders. I don't think you'd be disappointed.

antiwittgenstein: Thorough review, honest and funny. I might have confounded some of my friends when I introduced them to 'Band-aid' Scotch, but I think I would have a hard time convincing someone to smoke something under the premise 'It is only tastes a bit like granny panties.'

JetLife794: Thanks man! Yea the only real way to convince anyone to try Lakelands is to wait for their curiosity to get the better of them. It's similar to my experiences with Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.  Eventually everyone tries a booger or dirt bean...except no one ends up liking those flavors...not to say no one likes lakelands...oh screw it! To each his own lol
