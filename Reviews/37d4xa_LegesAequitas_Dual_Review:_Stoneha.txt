Dual Review: Stonehaven and Rich Dark Flake
By: LegesAequitas
---
I was generously gifted a very decent sample of Stonehaven from /u/bonehed. He was curious if the two blends were unique and so I am giving my thoughts on that for him and for the sub with a dual review. Stonehaven is a flake that is distributed only in the US by Esoterica but made in the UK by J.F. Germain. Rich Dark Flake is also made by J.F. Germain, but is basically for the UK/European market. It seems that it's a common idea that the two are the same blend or at least extremely similar. I will begin with Stonehaven and then review Rich Dark Flake  with my final summary after both reviews.

***Blend Name: Stonehaven***

*Description on Tin:* A marriage of air-cured leaf and Burley with selected dark Virginia. Hard pressed and aged to produce brown flakes with dark undertones. A traditional English flake favored by experienced pipe smokers.

*Leaf:* Burley and Virginia. Very dark, thin flakes.

*Tin Aroma:* Extremely bready. It smells like bread baked with chocolate chips or chocolate muffins. Extremely pleasant.

*Taste:* The burley is very present in the blend and it comes through as a very malty and deep flavor. It's marginally sweet, but remains fairly dry and a little cigar-like during most of the smoke. There is a bit of tangyness and fruitiness at times (I'd like to say it reminds me a bit of cranberries), but it's quite subdued for the most part. There is a real peppery tang along with a heavy dose of maltiness during the latter half of the smoke.

*Smokability:* I rubbed it out completely except for laying down a few larger strips/cube cuts at the bottom of the bowl. Lights very easily and stays lit quite easily as well. There is dottle at the end of the smoke, but that can be expected with a flake and also due to the larger chunks being placed at the bottom.

*Room Note:* Similar to the tin/bag note but with the lack of chocolate. It's kind of like toast. I'm fond of it.

*Thoughts:* There is a lot of hype surrounding Stonehaven but I'm not immediately blown away by the blend. It's certainly good, but I wouldn't characterize it as great. It's quite burley forward and it shows in the flavor. For myself, I wish the Virginias were a bit more present to give it a bit more sweetness and a bit more balance.

***Blend Name: Rich Dark Flake***

*Description on Tin:* No official description

*Leaf:* Burley and Virginia. Extra dark, thin flakes.

*Tin Aroma:* It smells a good bit like fruitcake. Very sweet and rich with a touch of rum.

*Taste:* Very sweet upon ignition. Upon initial inspection the taste is extremely similar to the base aroma of the tobacco itself, it's very fruity with something there that reminds me faintly of apples, currants, and raspberry jam. Given a bit of time there is a good bit of breadiness and nuttiness that matches the sweetness which is pleasant. There could even be a touch of a licorice or treacle taste but it's quite faint. I think the majority of the time I'm reminded of nutty, toasty, raspberry jam. Toast with raspberry jam sprinkled with hazelnuts if you will. The taste becomes a good bit less sweet and more bready after the middle of the smoke, but the raspberry/red fruit flavor is still there albeit less jam-like. It ends up very nutty and buttery and the smoke becomes quite creamy.

*Smokability:* I rubbed it out in the same fashion as the Stonehaven. Rich Dark Flake comes a bit moister, but it still lights well and remains lit after a 10 minute drying time.

*Room Note:* Super pleasurable. Like wheaten soda bread with butter and honey.

*Thoughts:* I'm really impressed with this. There is a good bit of burley, but there the Virginias are also present with their sweetness. While I don't really detect a casing, the richness and sweetness that can be found in the blend lead me to believe there could be a touch of some sort of sugary additive. It can bite a tiny bit if smoked too quickly and too hotly, but I don't find it to be a big issue.

***Dual summary:*** Okay here we go. I'm going to conclude that Stonehaven and Rich Dark Flake are absolutely different blends, but they do have similarities. The flakes are both extremely close look-alikes, but the Rich Dark Flake is a tad bit darker. I would claim they're both primarily burley, but Stonehaven is a lot more focused on the burley than the Virginia. I would consider the Stonehaven more straightforward and a bit stout. Rich Dark Flake can be quite multidimensional. It's a good bit sweeter than Stonehaven and also noticeably fruity with raspberry being a dominant theme at least for me. I would characterize these both as being a bit temperamental. They became hot very easily whenever I smoked outside due to even slight wind. When this happened the flavors turned ashy pretty quickly so I'm basing my findings on when I smoked them indoors. I used the same little cob to test both of them to get a sort of neutral medium as well as a Chris Askwith blasted Rhodesian.

I think it's pretty clear that I preferred Rich Dark Flake. I think there is a higher amount of dark Virginia to balance the burley which I like. There may be something else at play as well that just makes the Rich Dark Flake more multidimensional, but there it is. In the end, I like burley blends, but I don't find myself reaching for it as often as Englishes or straight Virginias and that may have biased my review.

* **Stonehaven: 3.0/4**
* **Rich Dark Flake: 3.4/4**

*Recommend to:* I think these are great flakes for anyone who is a fan of burley in a more classed up fashion. Stonehaven is for those who are more in favor of a purer burley taste with a bit of something extra which Rich Dark Flake has the burley base with a good bit more in the fruit and sweetness department.

*My Background:* I tend to like all sort of blends, but only dabble in aromatics sparingly. My favorites are G.L. Pease's Gaslight and McClelland's Christmas Cheer 2013.
====================================
xDemagog: I figured that Germain's did the same thing Gawith Hoggarth does, which is use the same base flake with just a different blend of toppings. I'll have to give them a side by side review now that I got a bit of Stonehaven from that States. I'm curious to see if my thoughts match yours. 

I can say I do find RDF sweeter and prefer it over Stonehaven. One of the few tobacco related perks of living in England. 
--
LegesAequitas: Perhaps so. I can only say that there was a very noticeable difference between the two. I'm looking forward to your thoughts. Also, you said you'd do a review on BurPer Kake as well that I'm still waiting for. ; )
--
xDemagog: Aw shit, thanks for reminding me. I'll get some on Monday and give it a review. I can also do Askwith Kake and his new Latakia Layer Kake as well. 
--
LegesAequitas: I got some of the first batch of Latakia Layer Kake in and have been meaning to try it and review it, but this dual review monopolized my time. Soon.
--
xDemagog: I got a bit about 4.5 weeks ago and really liked it, and I don't prefer Latakia blends. It's good stuff.
--
Formaldehydeontoast: Oh my. That layer cake looks gorgeous, sadly I've not been too keen on GQ's house blends but it looks delicious!
--
LegesAequitas: It certainly smells like it at least. I'm planning on cutting a bit of mine up on Thursday. I've actually generally liked most of Glynn's blends quite a bit. Which have you tried?
--
Formaldehydeontoast: I've tried Custom No.2 Halfzware, Classic English and Nottingham Lace Noir... Eh, I have enjoyed them but I felt that the halfzware was too heavy on the orientals giving it too much spice, the classic english was good but needs a tad more latakia and I think the cigar leaf is responsible for the spice, which is great but unless you really take your time with it, it becomes almost menthol-like in how it feels on the tongue, and with nottingham lace there is an utterly delicious initial light taste but following that it's too heavy on the perique, lacking that balancing sweetness. I could just be a tough customer though! Have you also tried any other of Glynns blends?
--
LegesAequitas: I haven't tried Halfzware as the sound of it didn't pique my interest, but I have tried Classic English and the Nottingham Lace Noir. I am quite fond of the English and while I'm fond of heavy latakia blends I am pretty happy with it. I think it's a pretty even-handed English. As with the Noir, I like it as well, but Glynn's blends are pretty heavy in perique in many cases so it's tough to like it if you don't like perique. I can vouch for the menthol like feel in some of his blends. I've especially noticed it in his BurPer Kake which ends with a minty and licorice-like flavor, but that's actually one reason why I like it. In the end, I generally like his stuff because he takes risks with his blends. Sometimes it comes out a bit weird, but I enjoy some of the weird results.
--
Formaldehydeontoast: Yeah, I certainly don't dislike any of his blends but I'm just relatively new to proper pipe blends so I'm trying things and seeing what I do/dont like, say for example I smoked a bowl of classic english recently and added in a pinch of frog morton's cellar and found it much more to my liking with a little boost in latakia and sweetness... I think I just have a terrible sweet tooth.

====================================
bonehed: Verrrry interesting... Thanks for taking the time for the write-up!
--
LegesAequitas: My pleasure! It's the very least I could do to thank you properly. What are your thoughts on Stonehaven personally?
--
bonehed: I enjoy it a lot, but I think much of its status is due to availability, like its mate Penzance. I get a chocolate covered cherries and fleeting menthol flavor at the char,  that soon melts into that malty, bready goodness you described. A very unique blend, unless you have a source for its twin sister(?) RDF. Always a treat, though I'd prefer others if I had to choose a single blend to live on.
--
LegesAequitas: Sounds pretty accurate. There are some very subtle sweet tastes to Stonehaven, but they are pretty quiet. I smell the chocolate pretty strongly in the bag, but it doesn't want to come out for me. Also, I can see where you get the menthol from. Whenever I smoke a burley based blend I taste a bit of mint and licorice at certain times, especially near the end of the smoke. However, that taste came through a lot more in the Rich Dark Flake.
