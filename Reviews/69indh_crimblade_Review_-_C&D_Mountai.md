Review - C&D Mountain Camp
By: crimblade

**Blend Name:** C&D Mountain Camp

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** At the request of an old customer, we took the recipe for Bayou Night and reversed the proportions of Latakia and Perique to create a full English in the Scottish vein. If Bayou Night is perfect for an evening on the bayou, Mountain Camp is a peerless choice for a day spent fishing.
The same tobaccos as Bayou Night with the proportions of Perique and Latakia exchanged, making this a heavy Latakia blend for the English smoker.

**Leaf:** Burley, Latakia, Oriental/Turkish, Perique, Virginia. Ribbon cut leaf with a very nice mixture of dark and light colored strips. The occasional very light leaf stands out.

**Tin Aroma:** Smokey Wood. Dark campfires in the chill evening of fall. A bit of a tangy note slips in occasionally.

**Taste:** Woody smoke. Slightly sour thanks to the orientals. A slight pepper on the retrohale thanks to the perique. If there were a blend that I would associate with the smells and tastes of camping this would be it. If you want to get really esoteric about it then go ahead and throw petrichor in there. I don't get much from the virginia or burley that are in there. 

**Smokability:** I've only ever gotten it in bulk, and like most C&D blends it's ready to go right out of the bag. Lights easily and burns steadily. Smokes cool without any tongue bite. It does have a tendency to need a relight about midway but that's not an issue for me. It has a medium nic hit so you'll notice how wonderful life can be and, if you haven't eaten recently, how unstable the earth can be.

**Room Note:** Smokey latakia, sit by a campfire and you'd hardly notice, sit inside and you'd probably turn heads. 

**Thoughts:** I wasn't sure what to expect with this one when I got it late last summer. However upon first light it was one I knew I would enjoy. It became the blend I reached when the opportunity to smoke presented itself. With a medium nic hit it has everything I look for in a relaxing smoke. Excellent flavor throughout the bowl, very little care or preparation needed, and just flat out enjoyable. Don't get me wrong this is a Latakia bomb, it's not shy about it, but behind the latakia is a host of nuances that you don't have to think overly hard about to find. I welcome the coming warmer months due to the increased ability to enjoy smokes outside, not to mention the return of my beloved Va/Pers to my rotation, however I will mourn the loss of the perfect weather for this blend. 

**Recommend to:** Latakia lovers rejoice, this ones got a great latakia flavor while still providing a complexity that other latakia bombs fail to deliver on. 

**Summary:** I love this blend, It's one of the first I've started stockpiling. At this point if I could only ever smoke one blend for the rest of time it would be this one. 

**Drink Pairings:**  Chocolate milk is absolutely divine. 

**Final Rating:** 4/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 3 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp and GLP Quiet Nights.

antiwittgenstein: Nice write up. I love this stuff - I think of it as a good spring to not-terribly-hot summer friendly english, the way you can enjoy a campfire in July on the right night.

crimblade: I actually think it may have been your review of it that convinced me to get a sample last year, so thanks for that!

====================================
claypainter: Chocolate milk?! Expound upon this, good sir.

crimblade: Well you know how s'mores go really well with a campfire? Well that's the only real reason I can figure that a tall glass of cold chocolate milk just goes so well with this smoke. Milk is normally pretty great for pairing with a smoke, but in this case the chocolate just adds the right big of counter flavor to the woody smoke that it really ups the whole experience.

claypainter: Interesting.
