I bought Penzance, I smoked Penzance, I like Penzance. A short review.

I purchased some Penzance the other day from my local B&M, and a few of you wanted my thoughts on it. First, I can see what all the jazz is about...this is a really good tobacco. In the tin, it smells like a cross between a campfire and the mustiness of my grandparents basement (in a good way). It lights easy, and smoked faster than I expected. And it tastes great. $75 on eBay great? No. $20 at my B&M great? Definitely. It's a subtle English, and nothing like the Frog Morton blends and Squad Leader I usually smoke when I want an English. I would pick it up in a heartbeat if I saw it at the store or online again.

All that said, don't go nuts trying to get some. You are going to drive the Toyota Camery to work everyday, not the Rolls Royce. And no one gets bent because they never had the chance to drive a Rolls Royce in the first place. Save your $100 and go buy the five other blends you have been waiting to try, or that Sav you have had your eye on. This is a really good tobacco, and I am glad I had the chance to acquire and smoke some, but it was chance that I found it near me. Enjoy what you smoke, not what others tell you to smoke. 

Penzance: 9/10
====================================
goodfellaslxa: If you haven't tried it but want to try the closest thing, get some GL Pease Quiet Nights.  I have smoked QN many times and recently got a few tins of Penzance in the Fall Esoterica Drop of 2017.  When I finally tried the fabled Penzance, I thought, "hmm, this is incredibly similar to QN, glad I only paid retail." 
--
TheSouthernThing: I haven't had anything more similar to Penzance than Quiet Nights but I honestly didn't find them *that* similar when fresh out of the tin. I still bought pounds of Quiet Nights to age and enjoy for years down the road haha.  Maybe with a little age it will become more similar to Penzance to my tastes but if not I've still got a bunch of quality tobacco I like!
--
TheHittman: That would be really interesting to know. Maybe a year or two will do wonders to getting a similar taste.

p4ttythep3rf3ct: Good review and thank you for smoking!  I likened the tin note to a tire fire once.  A gloriously tasty tire fire. :)

====================================
cpt-j4ck: Have you ever tried germains special latakia flake? If so could you by any chance give a short comparison? 
--
tankbuster183: I have heard the same about C&D Star of the East Flake.  I have this, Quiet Nights, Special Latakia Flake, and Penzance.  Maybe I should do a super comparative review? I'm trying not to open everything at once!
--
cpt-j4ck: If you ever have tried them all a review would be much appreciated sir. 
--
cecilchiefe: Agreed! 
--
chewsyourownadv: Star of the East is only similar in that it uses roughly the same kinds of components. Clocking in at 50% latakia though, it is a dramatically different blend from Penzance.
--
TheSouthernThing: Yep, I enjoy Star of the East but didn't find it similar to Penzance at all really.
--
adsr500: I have never had it, sorry.
--
cpt-j4ck: No problem. I'm just interested because some people say while not the same it's quite similar and others say it's nothing like it. 
--
freepancakesforall: Totally different smoking experiences. 
--
summerkc: No, it is nothing alike. 
--
lostarchitect: To me these are not alike at all. Penzance is not Latakia forward.
