====================================
feernot: SmokingEssy7887 ssssstealsss the sssssshow for sssssssure.

I can't give much of an opinion on the one by ThomasiusPufendorff, because I couldn't hear the video over his uni-brow.

====================================
afiddler: The first reviewer shouldn't have even posted that video.  But at least he was able to express his experience in a detailed and concise manner.  The second video is pure torture. There is no way I can watch thirty minutes of that.

trolljoy: Pipe tobacco review videos are largely horrible. The worst are where they just sit and smoke while taking long pregnant pauses and not really getting to the point.   
  
So bad I thought of doing my own. Noone needs to see you actually smoking in order to review it.

FullFrontalNoodly: Pretty much the only pipe youtuber I watch anymore is Stuff&Things.  It's a bonus that his taste in tobacco mirrors mine almost exactly.
--
trolljoy: Dude, I do like his reviews vs most of them.  
  
1. He isn't a total weirdo or neckbeard.  
2. He states his methodology. He doesn't just record him trying his first bowl and reacting to it. He tries it on multiple attempts both directly from the tin, later, and then during the review.  
  
It still drags for me, but it's not painful like most.  
  
Most youtube reviews take 30 minutes to get around to less insight than yet another "grassy virginia... nutty burley..." JimInks review.

Bankus: Yup I watch Stuff & Things too.  Kinda odd that Youtube pipe vids get maybe a couple of thousand views and that's it.  Guess it's a really niche hobby these days.

JakeJones: I would like to point out that the thirty minute video is a part 1. Part two is 22 minutes long. 55 minutes of Balkan sobranie review. Wow!
--
Bankus: Nooooooooooooooo
