====================================
givemeyours0ul: Its probably all u/fuzzy_totemz blends.... 
--
freepancakesforall: With a varying touch of Grape for good measure.
--
givemeyours0ul: And a sprinkle of some Bufflehead decoy or something from rustyshackleford. 
--
freepancakesforall: lol right. or a dash of my tears when I think of Rusty.
--
givemeyours0ul: Tears of rage mixed with sadness? I liked him, but he fucked me over big time. 
--
freepancakesforall: Yeah. Amazing guy right up until a patent Dunhill I traded a bag of aged Dunbar and cash for didn't show up in my mailbox.
--
givemeyours0ul: Yeesh.... 
--
freepancakesforall: Yeah. It finally did after the police report. I think there's a chance he died in Hurricane Harvey. He'd just gotten a divorce and moved to Houston.
--
givemeyours0ul: I couldn't remeber if it was you who had to file the police report. Man, that would be crazy if he died. I'd feel bad for talking shit about him. The last deal I made with him I actually sent money to his wife's paypal. When he dropped off reddit I emailed her and he got back to me with typical rusty excuses. Never saw the goods or heard from him again. Oh well. 
--
freepancakesforall: Yeah, I'd feel bad but my gut says he's just ghosting to avoid the shitstorm. He was an amazing trader right up until.
