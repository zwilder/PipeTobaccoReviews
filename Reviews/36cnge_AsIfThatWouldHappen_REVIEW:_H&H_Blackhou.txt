====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: **Review #13**

**Name**: Hearth & Home Blackhouse (Marquee Series)

**Description on tin**: Blackhouse is an award winning Latakia based blend with Virginias, Orientals, Dark-Fired Kentucky, Perique and a bit of unflavored Black Cavendish to emulate an old classic.

**Leaf**: A nice soft ribbon cut, Medium-dark brown, with golden flecks throughout and good touches of dark and black leaf all over. Medium length and thickness to the ribbons. The moisture from the tin was spot on.

**Tin aroma**: Smokey Latakia deliciousness, lovely woody campfire smell, sweet and sour with tangy orientals. The smokeyness abates slightly and lets the freshness
and sweetness shine through, with the earthy, leathery kentucky popping it's head in to check the score. Is this what heaven smells like?

**Taste**: Is this what heaven TASTES like too?! I hope so, unless I don't go, then I hope it sucks. Right off the light it is very oriental forward, slightly spicy, tangy, very rich but super smooth. It quickly sweetens up, just right where it needs to be, the Cavendish is perfect. The Latakia shines through and takes centre stage along side the Orientals, with the Cavendish and Virginia now in support. The Kentucky turns up shortly afterwards and helps keep the flavor full and earthy. The dense flavor continues throughout the entire bowl, there is not a dull moment, the taste dance constantly between sweet and spicy, and smokey and earthy. The smoke is thick, velvet smooth and rich, and it never bites. This is the result that I always imagine when I first go to try a new Balkan. Massive flavour that touches all the bases, but still remains very approachable, no mental strain necessary attempting to analyse the nuances, just light it and puff and it does the work for you, you won't miss a thing. One of the most delicious and pleasant retrohales I have ever experienced.


**Smokeability**: Packs, lights and stays lit like a dream. Never needed drying, always burnt down to a barely existent white ash, probably because I enjoyed it so much I never stopped puffing.

**Summary**: This is a next level Balkan.
There is a tonne of flavor here, and it is perfectly balanced, sufficiently complex, never falters, and really scratches every itch a Balkan Fiend could have. One of the best blends I have smoked so far. I recently reviewed McClelland Blue Mountain, and it felt slightly lacking, if you felt the same way, this is your saviour, I think this is what I expected, and I am glad I found it here.
This could easily be my new all day smoke.

**Score** 5/5, Absolutely wonderful smoke. I'm glad I have another tin. I'll be getting more.

Comintern: Nice review! I've always heard good things about this blend now I've really gotta pick up a tin.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thanks. I really enjoyed smoking through my tin, in case you couldn't tell. Go for it if you can get hold of it.
--
Comintern: yeah it seems to be out of stock in a few places
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: I had that problem with white knight, but Smokingpipes.com got it in Stock just before I made an order si I threw one it.
--
hvywldrnss: Have you tried White Knight yet? It was unavailable back when I picked up Blackhouse. Nice review btw. I agree with everything you said here.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thankyou. No I haven't tried it yet, I never managed to make an order while it was in stock until now.
Really excited about it arriving though. 

I already have 3 tins open in jars and will be opening my Frog first for the community review so the WK will have to wait a bit longer.

====================================
JCelsius: Something about Blackhouse didn't do it for me. It wasn't a bad smoke, but comparing it to another H&H tin I got, Magnum Opus, it just wasn't as pleasant to smoke. 
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: I have heard and read good things abouy Magnum Opus. This ia my first H&H, although I have a tin of White Knight in the mail as we speak, I may need to get a tin of M.O next.
--
defrost24601: +1 for Magnum Opus.  It is very similar to Blackhouse, but is just a bit better.  I keep both on hand, but I usually go for the MO when I feel like some Latakia.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Sounds like a great smoke, I'm excited to get hold of some.
--
JCelsius: Since you loved Blackhouse so much, maybe Magnum Opus wouldn't be as good to you...or maybe you'd love it more! Dunno, but bother are praiseworthy blends if I'm being honest. I just wouldn't get Blackhouse again considering Magnum Opus is similar but better IMO.

You'll have to post a review of White Knight. I wanted to get some with my last order but they were out of stock.

--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: I love trying new blends so Ill try the MO, it can't be bad, even if I don't love it as much as Blackhouse. I'll definitely review Whute Knight, really looking forward to getting it.
--
hvywldrnss: What makes MO better to you? I haven't tried it yet either.
--
JCelsius: Honestly it's hard to pinpoint because the two blends are very similar but to me MO was a little smoother, lighter smoke. Blackhouse felt like it bogged me down a little bit. 

Of course, that doesn't rule a blend out to me. I'm smoking a blend from Tsuge called Ryujin right now (which I think I'll do a formal review of at the end of the tin) and it is definitely a heavy English but I'm loving it.
