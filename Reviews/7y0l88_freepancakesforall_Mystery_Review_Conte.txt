freepancakesforall: Hey everyone, here is the long-awaited Official 2nd Round of the Mystery Review! If this is of any interest to you, do yourself a favor and head over and subscribe to r/MysteryTobaccoReview     

There will be a couple of reminder posts in r/pipetobacco but most of the communication will take place over on the official sub so we don't flood this place.      

Feel free to ask any questions. We had a great time last go around and are looking forward to a fantastic Round 2!
