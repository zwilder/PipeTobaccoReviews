[Review] Solani Aged Burley Flake
By: Sku77s
---
Blend Name: Solani Aged Burley Flake

Description on Tin: No description on the tin so I'm going to pull one from SP. "A bold blend of dark fired burleys from Solani, the classic earthy heaviness of the dark fired burley really shines through in Aged Burley Flake, as does the nicotine that accompanies those heavy, robust flavors."

Leaf: A wide thin flake of nearly all dark burley. My tin came at a almost perfect moisture level. I can't imagine why their not using these tins for the Solani Silver Flake. I've never had the Silver Flake but I assume this vaccum tin would serve it better.

Tin Aroma: A rich earthy note, with almost a hint of brown sugary sweetness. Nothing but a heady burley note accompanied by the sweetish smell of quality leaf.

Taste: A wonderful experience if you can keep smoking slow. No, it's not going to bite you, I just find that the flavors muddle themselves in relation to your cadence. Slower is always better. A dark earthy taste with an almost complete absence of the sweetness from the tin, that has been replace by nuts and a oaky aftertaste I find surprisingly enjoyable.

Smokability: I was expecting a bigger Nic hit from a all burley smoke. For me this is a few levels beneath Peterson's 3P, which I hold several tiers below Black XX Rope. Beyond the Nic warning this is a wonderful relaxing pipe. I find myself grabbing my Vaper's and Vabur's for a daily smoke, this tends to come out around noon or before bed just because it seems to take my palate hostage.

Room Note: I found the room note to be a stonger version of the tin not. A big bold earthy smell with a slight sweetness behind it. Not at all unpleasant to me, but some others might not appreciate such a dominant one sided note.

Thoughts: Really happy I received this, I had been throwing around the idea of getting a few tins of Solani since I read my first review of their Silver Flake. If the quality of the leaf and smoke I'm having now is any indication Solani will be receiving a good amount of my buisiness.

Recommend to: People who enjoyed Carter Hall or Sir Walter Raliegh. Also if you wanted a crossover between a straight VA and true dark fired I think this might suffice. Lastly if your trying to exorcise a ghost fold and stuff a flake, the dominant burley flavors should chase out most lesser demons.

Summary: A wonderful smoke when you can afford to let something dominate your palate. This could probably be remedied with a pairing with a good drink, right now I'm going with a blackberry wine. Its a nice complement but not a palate cleaner.

My Background: 3 years smoking a pipe, occasionaly enjoy a cigar, previous nail smoker. Tasted this in a briar, cob, and a clay. I have alot of reviews I need to get posted. I'll try to do 2-3 a week. But my thanks go out to u/carnesy and u/levins0 for some things to review and burn in my pipes. This one really hits the spot for a comeback smoke, and was a wonderful distraction.

carnesy: Glad you enjoyed it!

Sku77s: Aside from OTC's this is the only pure burley I've had. Is this an exceptional blend or can I expect the same quality from other burley only blends?
--
carnesy: Can't really say, I got a tin of this and Wessex Burley Slice and smoked some of those but passed the ABF onto you. People tell me they are very similar, almost identical in fact. So if liked these try the wessex version (black and blue tin). I'll be grabbing another tin of ABF soon to do a direct comparison.

crimblade: >I can't imagine why their not using these tins for the Solani Silver Flake. I've never had the Silver Flake but I assume this vaccum tin would serve it better.

Gah, that stupid non vacuum sealed tin!
--
Sku77s: There are only two reasons I can think of for this. 
1. Silver Flake needs air to retain *something* from the factory.

2. This is a tobacco that flies off shelves and the didn't think it needed one.

I think every other tin they have is sealed.
--
crimblade: I've often wondered if it benefits from aerobic fermentation and that's why they do it, I can't imagine they do it without some intent. It's a wonderful smoke so an unsealed tin is no reason to not get it.
--
Sku77s: That's what I was thinking. Solani obviously cares about the quality of their product so there has to be a reason. Its not apathy or laziness.

I'm sure it is a great smoke, its been on the to-try list for a couple years, and the reviews I've read have been stellar.

====================================
PopnCrunch: I just had a bowl of 656 this morning in a little Petersen and it was great.  This is one of the blends I count as having a flavor that's just a stones throw from Stonehaven.

Others are Orlik Strong Dark Kentucky, 
Old Dark Fired, 
and sometimes Orlik Golden Sliced, depending on the pipe.

Anything with a smooth, mild, earthy, slightly sweet and nuanced with cocoa or marshmallow fits the bill.
--
Sku77s: Hmm never had Stonehaven but I've had all the others. There are similarities but I find this aged burley to have a much tamer profile and easier to prepare than most dark fired blends.
