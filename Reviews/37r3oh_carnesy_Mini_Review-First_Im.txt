Mini Review/First Impression of MM Independence Day
By: carnesy
---
I smoked this out of a MM cob (new in my case, but a rough and worn, reliably proven hard worker is also acceptable) because to smoke it from anything else would be sacrilegious, unpatriotic, and communist. 

Tin note: Dark Chocolate and Mixed Berries.

Appearance: Dark Brown and Black Leaf with bits of gold scattered about. Much like 'Murica with Her dark rich soil of the Great Plains and the muddy waters of the Mighty Mississippi with bits of amber grain for good measure.

Moisture: Like every good hard workin 'Murican this blend comes ready to go from the start, but does even better with a few minutes to cool it's heels and get it's head in the game before you start it.

Packing: Does well with a good old stolidly simple method. Like the name Frank, a good 'Murican classic. Not pretencious, but with a  ubicquitis history to it.

Lighting: Again like any good 'Murican, it likes fire and it takes to the task appointed to it readily.

Smokability: Like a good, Blue Collar 'Murican working man it burns efficiently but does well when approached with a cool, methodical manner.

Taste: Much like some of 'Muricas earliest and best explores this blend takes one back to the savage yet brilliant, pagans from the north and their Cult of the Blood Red Moon. However it is a uniquely 'Murican take with a mix of berries instead of one singular source paying honor to 'Murica's mix and blend of various origins, supported by a lingering back bone of good old 'Murican Burley.

Thoughts: Much like Great Dane, Russ's original aro blend made for the MM brand, Independence Day is a worthy and worth wile aromatic, even for us snobs who generally turn our noses up at those "soppy, goopy, aros that taste like nothing more than hot steam".


TIL;DR: 'MURICA 'MURICA 'MURICA! FUCK YEAH! DON'T BE A DAMN DIRTY COMMIE HIPPY, GET YOU SOME AROMATIC FREEDOM!

carnesy: It's good tobacco. Like I said it reminded me of Cult BRM except with a variety of berries instead of just cherry. Post exhale if I made an air pocket in my mouth and exhaled again I could taste a nice bit of burley.
--
chewsyourownadv: Do you think it's as ghosty as BRM?
--
carnesy: Don't know. Like I said that was my first bowl, and it was in a new unsmoked cob.

====================================
bboyer1987: I got my tin on Tuesday, but I still haven't decided if i should use my old briar or wait until I get a cob, so have held off on smoking it.
--
carnesy: Got mine in on Wednesday and was going to save it to pop on the 4th but decided to open it now and do a review so people could decide if they wanted to get it and have it arrive in time (even though we have a month + till the 4th of July).
