[Rich's Cigar Store](http://www.richscigarstore.com/)

It was fantastic. The tin prices were decent the bags of penzance and stonehaven where a bit high for my taste ($60 & $80). But they do have a full stock of esoterica tins and bulk. There were sooo many nice pipes and if my dad wasn't waiting illegals parked I would have fondled many of them. I did gawk at a nice Eltang billiard. 

**Edit:** I went back today to get a proper look around. [Here is a small album](http://imgur.com/a/7ExGa). They have quite a selection. I got to hold an Eltang and admire the craftsmanship. The young employees seem a bit clueless about pipes at least and the seasoned gents/owner are a bit curmudgeon. Its a nice shop with good selection but not all that friendly. 

A newish pipe smoker asked how to keep his tobacco from drying out and I told him to put in mason jars and if he needed to rehydrate it to put it in a container with a damp paper towel over the top. The shop guy cut me off and promptly persuaded him to use & buy the humidor buttons instead of going out to buy mason jars. So yeah, that pissed me off.


====================================
graverubber: Fantastic shop. I bought my first pipe there (a cheap little bargain basket find) back in 2001. Friendly place. Very knowledgable. 
--
federalmng: I also purchased my first pipe there while in town for the Oregon Brewers Festival.
--
====================================
Flatticus: Fantastic house blends, as well.  That's the former home of Steve Books from House of Calabash.  Hope you get a chance to stop back in and grab some.
--
PhysicsNovice: Does he not do house blends for his shop (Steve & House of Calabash)?
--
pfeifenraucher: he does. after talking with him some, i'm under the impression that the parting from Rich's was less than amicable. i don't know any details, though.
--
Flatticus: Yes, but he used to do them for Rich's.
--
jesserc: their 'Sweet Orient' is one of my favorites. 

--
====================================
orlicker: Did they have any more pelican? 
--
PhysicsNovice: not anymore. You in Portland?
--
PhysicsNovice: I don't know how bad you want a tin but if you want to pay shipping and the tin cost I'll send you one.
--
PipingYodaApprentice: I don't mean to prod, but if the guy seems to be within distance of the shop, as you are, you might be able to meet up somewhere convenient to trade off at cost, rather than dealing with shipping. Help a piper out.
--
orlicker: LOL. Prod you are my fellow piper. I know physics would LOVE to drive to the great state of North Dakota to meet me halfway from Pennsylvania. No worries haha
--
PipingYodaApprentice: LOL he made it sound like he was close enough to drive there and pick up
--
====================================
jimjimwest: Great store, hope we don't lose our source for penzance and stonehaven :-).  FYI, they asked me not to reveal my source for the stuff when I was there last and they don't keep it out so you had to 'know' to get any.  They only told me about it after I picked up the pelican and Balkan Sobranie and asked some very pointed questions not expecting to find unicorns :-). I hope this means they are set for a while.
--
PhysicsNovice: I think it was a mistake. The new kid called down to see if there was any with the bulk downstairs and nobody answered so he had to go look. He didn't seem to know about its special place in the tobacco world. But, there  is no way Im paying $80 for a bag of Penzance so they can keep their precious.  
--
jimjimwest: At the Chicago pipe show a TIN of penzance was going for 70.  I see that it's showing up at shops recently so maybe the supply issue is about to be a thing of the past.  Just like they brought back pelican and there are rumors of kingfisher coming back too,

If you hadn't been to Rich's before, I'm glad you made it down as it's a great shop, not many like it in our neck of the woods.  I made it down to house of calabash a couple of weeks ago and bought a bit of everything he blends.  That's another place you'll have to check out next time you are down there as it's another old school pipe tobacco dominated place you don't see the likes of anymore.  
--
PhysicsNovice: Checked it out today. Loved it. 
--
====================================
pfeifenraucher: folks, a couple other PDX pipers have mentioned wanting to make a smoking club for local folks. anyone here interested? i had designs on asking Steve Books to host us at House of Calabash or somewhere in Oregon City, which is a lovely place for lunting, full of historical plaques and such. unfortunately, i've had trouble reaching Mr. Books on the phone about it, and haven't been down to OC in a minute. 

would you folks like to consider a local PDX pipe club?
