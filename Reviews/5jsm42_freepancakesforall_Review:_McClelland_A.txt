Review: McClelland Avenue Blend "TQ"
By: freepancakesforall
---
This is going to be a quick review with the sole purpose of finding out how this blend stacks up to Lane 1Q, the best selling tobacco in the universe. Every website boasts "if you like Lane Limited 1Q then you'll love this!". Deceptive marketing tactic or honest to goodness truth? Let's find out.

**Blend Name:** McClelland Avenue Blend TQ (Top Quality)   

**Description on Tin:** Bulk blend with no formal introduction. So I've decided to make one up as if it were a GL Pease Old London blend: "You're sitting on a rowboat in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Kelp and plankton nibble at the old oak under your hull. An antique credenza sits on the plank across from you, almost sinking the boat. On it, next to an old screw, an open ziploc entices you with the smell of a Greek bakery at dawn. The first puff reminds you of a time when danishes and vanilla custards would waft down the avenue in the early crepuscular hour. McClelland's TQ. The wafting continues..."    

**Leaf:** A big sack of cavendish tobaccos made from golden virginias and black burleys. A chestnut and black mixture. Some ribbon, some chunks. Looks beautiful.

**Tin Aroma:**    Pretty damn good. Smells as described with a warm vanilla, chocolate, and unidentified flavoring object. More on that in a second.  
 
**Taste:** As described, the first puffs certainly bring flavors of a creamy vanilla and chocolate/cocoa with the vanilla being slightly more dominant for me. The base components do indeed make it a very similar blend to Lane 1Q. Very. Except there's a bit less of a sweetness from the vanilla in McClelland TQ, making it a bit more harmonious in the bowl. The thing that really separates this from the 1Q is the "other" flavor I pick up. Whereas the other flavoring component in both this and 1Q is supposedly a coconut essence, the McClelland features a flavor I'd describe more as a floral tonquin. A nutty, leathery, wood paneled, faint vanilla escence. I've got a couple tonka beans sealed in a mason jar that a friend brought back from South America. A whiff when I came back inside from each smoke confirmed these feelings.

**Smokability:**  This smokes great for an aromatic. Just hit my sixth bowl or so and nothing goopy or disgusting at the end. Just a fine white ash all the way down. Of the six bowls I think I had about 3 relights total, and two of them were probably from when I was on putzing with my phone and forgot to smoke.

**Closing Thoughts:** Start with Lane 1Q. Then subdue the overall sweetness and bring it down a notch. Then add that extra floral/tonquin flavoring. You have McClelland Avenue TQ. Overall this is a very solid aromatic. If you love Lane 1Q (I know you're out there!) then you would definitely enjoy this. A tobacco in the same family but with a touch more complexity, maturity, and class. 
====================================
Jaxx666: Great review. I actually like TQ much much much better than 1Q. 
--
freepancakesforall: I agree. I think every 1Q smoker should try it. It could be a nice gateway into non aro blends.

Yep, Love me some TQ. Always have a jar in my tobacco stash.
--
freepancakesforall: Yeah. I always have a big jar of 1Q for general purposes (friends over wanting to smoke, dog walks in inclement weather, etc). I think this will become the new solid aro in my arsenal.

====================================
burks21: That sounds delicious 
--
freepancakesforall: It truly is. Certainly worth trying an ounce for $3 or so. 
--
evenflowsolo: I just bought an ounce today, haven't tried it yet. Looking forward to it now. I paid a lot more than 3 dollars for it, though. Can you get a much better deal on tobacco by buying in bulk?
--
freepancakesforall: Smokingpipes.com has it for $3.13 and pipesandcigars.com has it for $2.99. Are you in the US?
--
evenflowsolo: No, Edmonton. I was just browsing their site! It looks like I can have stuff shipped from there. Quite the selection they have and prices look way more reasonable than the local tobacconist I have been going to. I'm new to pipes and loving it so far. 
--
freepancakesforall: Welcome! You certainly can ship. Definitely encourage supporting local tobacconists, but it's really tough to beat online prices. 
--
====================================
Dadgy: Up voted for the Pease-esque description. Well done.
--
freepancakesforall: Ha, thank you! Secretly hoping someone from Pease/C&D reads this. I've got a lifetimes worth of esoteric nonsense in my brain. 
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: I didn't get past crepuscular.
--
freepancakesforall: It's satire. 
--
givemeyours0ul: I know.... And my statement was hyperbole.
--
freepancakesforall: My statement was sarcasm. ;)
--
====================================
Highball2814: This is the tobacco I own the most of. I have close to a pound and a half in one of those red top jars.

When I trade with anyone, if they can tolerate an aromatic at all, I try to throw in a bowl or two of this, because I think it is so good.

Thanks for reviewing.
--
freepancakesforall: If everybody tried this there probably wouldn't be any aromatic haters left in this world. 
--
Highball2814: I tell people it's the aromatic that smokes a bit like an English. I get very little tongue burn from this. I know most aromatics go downhill with age, but I find this one gets better.
