Powder Toast Man Review
By: SmokeOnTheWater17
---
Pipe: Custombilt His Nibs
Drink: Sweet Iced Tea
Tin Note: Dark Chocolate, tobacco, plums, spice

Lighting: 1 initial match, 2 matches for relights
Smoke: thick, clean white, voluminous 
Room note: outside but wife said it was nice

Taste: I initially tasted a Lakeland like essence but it was not strong and it sat in the background throughout the smoke. A complex smoke that I got a hints of nuts, Granny Smith apples, some undetermined spice, roasted sour nuts. I did not get cinnamon this time around but I will try a larger bowl. Often I taste much more in a wide, shallow bowl. 

This is a great tasting tobacco. I would love more. I would also like to know how to make it. My only regret is that I will not have more after my next bowl. This could be a rotation tobacco and great to follow an English smoke.  Thank you for including me in this test.
