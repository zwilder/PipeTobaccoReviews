Tobacco Review: Mac Baren Vanilla Cream Loose Cut

Review # 83

**Blend Name:** Mac Baren Vanilla Cream Loose Cut
 
**Description on Tin:** Mac Baren Vanilla Cream is a colorful blend mixed with cut plugs. It is manufactured from specially selected and aged Virginia and mild black Cavendish tobaccos, then blended with an exceptional Vanilla flavor. This selection creates an outstanding blend with superior flavor, unique aroma and distinctive taste experience.

**Leaf:** Boring mottled ribbon. Very dry, especially for an aro.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Rum raisin, vanilla, baked goods, vanilla candle.

**Taste:** Boozy? That is weird. Gently nutty. Quite akin to Prince Albert. A little sour. Slightly sweet. A bit rummy. Cavendish, whatever that tastes like, but it seems like most Cavendish blends I’ve known. Buttery. Sweetness comes and goes, nutty and sweet in turns. Coconut rum? Gets a little ashy after a relight and tamp. Hits its stride at the end. Burley, buttery, vanilla and coconut rum.

**Nicotine:** Firm 3, so wicked heavy for an Aromatic.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** It is pretty dry in the jar, I put it out for 5-10 minutes, or even pinch directly from the source into the pipe. Can bite just a bit. I really enjoy how creamy this is at times, it led to some of the more impressive rings I’ve blown. If you overdry it, it turns into just burley.
 
**Room Note:** Pipe tobacco number 1. I mean toasty tobacco, a warm smell, a touch of something sweet. Not as fragrant as say Captain Black, but certainly something not offensive to company.

**Thoughts:** Whenever people complain about poor aromatics, MacBaren Vanilla usually gets shouted from multiple directions as a great alternative, something that tastes like it smells, isn’t goopy, doesn’t bite, will give you longer, more lustrous hair, the smile of Don Draper, and the comedic flare of cocaine era Robin Williams. I am not exactly sold. It meets each of the promises halfway. It is tasty, pretty dry, and the bite is pretty minimal, especially when you respect it. It has that nice nicotine touch missing from most aromatics.  But… for the aromatic billed as the aromatic to try when the others disappoint, well I am still a touch disappointed.

So build me up for the next fall /r/pipetobacco – is the MacBaren Vanilla Flake much better?
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Prince Albert, Borkum Riff Original or Whisky, Sutliff Molto Dolce
 
**Summary:** A nicotine heavy lightly vanilla nutty burley blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight, and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

(--)This is not for me (Vanilla Ice)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Vanilla Flavored Coffee)

(----)This is suffering (Diet Vanilla Anything)

====================================
jb270: Semi related to your rating system. You can make your own vanilla extract by steeping whole vanilla beans in high proof vodka. Cheap, easy, and actually drinkable. In addition to use in recipes I sometimes use it to add an extra warming kick to hot chocolate on very cold days. Also works in any cocktail that calls for vanilla vodka. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Interesting, I will have to give that a shot. Thanks!
--
jb270: Just throw the vanilla beans in 750 ml to a liter of vodka. Let it steep for about a month in a cool, dark place. I used Absolut since there was a good sale on it at the time. Any decent vodka should work though. It usually only gets used when I'm baking or if I have guests that like sweet cocktails(I usually stick to whiskey) so it lasts a long time. 
--
Tdot_Grond: I think I'm going to try this! 
 
How many bean pods did you put in the bottle of vodka? 
--
jb270: I think I split 3-5 of them length wise. Depends on the size of the bean, bottle, and the proof. 
--
freepancakesforall: Then use the spent vanilla pods to flavor a batch of homemade brown ale. 
--
jb270: Now this I'm going to need to try at some point. 
--
freepancakesforall: Totally. I also cooked a pan of oak chips on low heat for a bit too. Combined with an English brown ale mix was amazingly smooth and flavorful. 
--
jb270: Experimenting with bourbon barrel aging would be a lot of fun as well. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Then, make your own [vanilla infused flake](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3z26j9/just_about_to_seal_up_some_hh_latakia_flake/). Then, drink vanilla vodka while smoke vanilla infused flake. 
--
jb270: I'm not huge on aromatics(or vodka for that matter) but I'll file away this link for future reference. 
--
====================================
SupraMario: Lol I still have a tin of it...And I felt the same way as you did, it just didn't live up to the hype for me...The flake is something I'm looking to try though.
--
====================================
Dadgy: Pretty much my exact experience with the stuff. Thanks for the review. 
--
====================================
88tidder: Thorough. Thanks for the review 
--
====================================
pluesha: I would agree with you part of the way, in my opinion it's much worse though.
--
antiwittgenstein: Ouch. How bad on my scale? I think it holds its own okay against Captain Black and the Riff, but I am pretty lenient when it comes to unpretentious drugstore baccy - I guess the worst part of the Vanilla Cream is that is seems like it should be clearly superior to those blends, but just barely edges them out - and most of that is achieved by forgoing the PG.
--
====================================
ThatGuyGaren: I've tried both the flake and the loose cut, and although the flake is the preferred one around here, I liked the loose cut much much more. 
--
====================================
cmdr_andrew_dermott: It was just so bland after the Nutty Irishman...
