Review: First Impressions of MacBaren Old Dark Fired.

In the mail yesterday I received 8oz. of MacBaren Old Dark Fired, from 4Noggins. (Major props to 4Noggins for excellent service, even to exotic and foreign western Canada!) Loaded up 1/2 to 3/4 of a bowl yesterday in a new Capri pipe I was given for Christmas. Not a top shelf pipe by any means, but in my experience so far a competent smoker. Some sort of full-bent shape; I'm not super familiar with what you'd call it. Made it Italy, lower end briar. This one gurgles a bit and I can't get a pipe cleaner through the mouthpiece, plus the stem isn't totally centred, but smokes fine nonetheless.  
Anyway, loaded the pipe last night after an evening at the pub. Pretty chilly, although not awful as far as Calgary goes. The tobacco itself was 8oz. bulk just in a big zip lock bag. It wasn't in flakes, but much bigger chunks than the fine ribbons I've encountered in Frog Morton and Cairo. Very rough, stringy texture. Almost like dried moss. Quite dark, smells robust. Pulled it apart a little bit until it was roughly ribbon shaped, then just sort of stuffed a large pinch into the bowl and tamped. Tamped it fairly tightly, actually. Draw was still good, so I didn't worry too much.  
It lit fairly easily. Quick charring light, it took the flame very easily and evenly. Just seemed to kind of settle in.  
The flavour was exactly what you'd expect from the smell of the tobacco itself. Dark, earthy, again kind of reminding me of dry moss. Definitely some spice to it. I'm not hugely experienced with different tobaccos, but it was the same spice that I taste in GLP Cairo, although a bit less in your face. I understand that the spice in Cairo comes from perique, but I don't think ODF has perique in it. Must have been something similar though. A little bit of sweetness too, like the wrapping leaves on a cigar.  
Within just a couple minutes of smoking I had a beautiful layer of fine grey ash. I didn't actually have to dump it through the entire smoke. It seemed to work as a perfect insulator, because I actually didn't need a single relight. The tobacco underneath just kept smoking and smoking.   
Produced nice big clouds of smoke, although it was cold enough that some of it was just my breath too. Not sure how much. I smoked very slowly, but it never seemed to be in danger of going out. My wife had to relight a couple times, but she was smoking a smaller pipe and that seems to be an ongoing downside.  
I actually set the pipe down after maybe a half hour. Partially because it was getting colder, and partially because I'm not quite used to that much nicotine. It's definitely stronger than what I'm smoked before, and I don't want to push my luck. I once smoked a cigar that was far stronger than I anticipated, and I'm not keen on repeating that.  
Went back to the pipe today after work. It had actually been sitting outside at around -20C all day and all night. If anything it smoked even better. Calgary is not only cold, it's very dry. Probably the winter air sucked all the moisture right out of it. Anyway, re-lit this evening, and it's like I hadn't even set it down. Only needed the single light and all that flavour came right back. I think it might have felt a bit stronger this time, and I just sort of sat back and puffed for a while, totally zoned out, just enjoyed the smoke. By the time I finished the bowl it kind of felt like that slight buzz you get from drinking a beer on an empty stomach. Pleasant and warm. It was an incredibly peaceful experience. Again just smoking slowly, no tongue bite, a bit of spice, a bit of sweetness, but mostly that dark earthy flavour.

Not much more I can think to say about it. Really good smoke, one of the best I've had. This will definitely be on high rotation for me. Will definitely try it in a corn cob as well, see how that affects the flavour.
====================================
Rust__: As a novice pipe smoker. This sounds like what I am looking for.

Excellent review by the way. Not overly complex.
--
carnesy: I found ODF stout but not overwhelming, even as smoker with low nic tolerance. Now that I've mostly been smoking GH&Co's Black Irish X I find ODF to be pleasant but kinda lacking.

Basically I would say don't shy away from ODF just because you're new. It might be potent for you, but it can build your tolerance quicker and/or just an occasional smoke when you want to feel the nicotine buzz.
--
lightningserpent: I found ODF was not as satisifing when I started smoking Kendal Dark, but it is much easier to take with me when I travel.
--
summerkc: Are you a novice tobacco user in general?  If you don't some tolerance built up for this stuff I'd be hesitant to recommend it.  I've been smoking cigars and pipes for years and more than a half a bowl and I get sick as hell.  It is super strong. But damn the flavor is so good.
--
Rust__: Im not novice tobacco. Dunhill Nightcap does not phase me too bad. And that's supposed to be rather strong.

====================================
fiftieshouseholdguy: It's now my go to tobacco....I'd say little to any spice or sweetness (IMHO).

I prefer it in flakes myself, and you must smoke it slowly and it's great in cold weather/late at night and right at home with some nice dark, malty Ceylon tea;-)

IrenaeusGSaintonge: My palette may very well be too inexperienced to catch a lot of the subtleties.
--
====================================
pluesha: Nice write up!

Two days earlier and you woulda caught that nice chinook weather that's been destroying my head.
--
IrenaeusGSaintonge: I caught the tail end of it last night, I think. Temperature dropped steadily after about 9.
--
====================================
mimefrog: It's also awesome rubbed out and mixed with Semois, though they need some time together in a jar due to the very different humidities of the tobaccos.
