Mac Baren Golden Extra

From tobaccoreviews.com:

Since Golden Extra was introduced, it has gained many, many fans all over the world – rightly so. The special selected brown Burley tobaccos, treated with a distinctive flavor and mixed with just a touch of golden Virginia, are carefully pressed and stored. The large slices are cut and partly rubbed up, which makes this blend easy to fill into your pipe. This slowly burning Burley based blend is very satisfying and you will enjoy the slight note of chocolate – a note that all good Burley tobacco produces naturally.
Notes: Introduced in 1954. The blend is 100% identical to Golden Blend it is just the name that is different in the USA!



My foray into the world of burleys seems to be leading me down an ever lightening path. Makes sense as it was the same way with cigars; I started with the boldest ones I could find and then gravitated towards medium - mild.  Golden Extra (or Golden Blend depending on where you reside) falls squarely in that mild - medium camp.

When you open the tin you're greeted by broken flakes that arrive at the perfect moisture level. I'm notorious for microwaving everything but this is a stuff and puff. The tin note is sweet sugary tobacco goodness with a punch of something purple like raisins or a tawny port.  

Another quality I enjoy is that this blend isn't fussy, you simply pack it in the pipe (keep a light hand for maximum flavor), light once, maybe twice, and you're good to go.  It honestly spoils me when I reach for other blends because I have to pay attention to packing, what a chore! (First world problems, amirite?)


First light: pleasant burley. No sour perfume taste, no tang, just an honest tobacco flavor.  There's an extra sweetness here that's from the topping but I don't get cocoa, it's more of a honey flavor that's present in all MacB blends, (I think it's maple sugar and water?) and if it is maple it's not the fake pancake taste you'll find, think Grade B or Dark Amber... Woody and slightly sweet with just a bit of spice.

The burley flavor is mild but that doesn't mean it isn't good.  I find toast, walnuts or cashews, butter cookies, really a smattering of light brown flavors here.  The topping gives it a deeper note and the combination is just... pleasant.  

As you progress through the bowl the pinch of Virginia will pop in with a quick burst of citrus and then disappear just as fast leaving you wondering if you imagined that orange taste or if it's really in there.  There's the *tiniest* bit of zip on the retrohale like the slight bit of sting from ginger in a Vernors.  There's a looming taste of vanilla wanting to come in here but it never quite shows up. Methinks it's something in the sugary topping.

Now, before we go any further this IS a Mac Baren blend and it will Mc Bite you if you puff it like a school yard bully.  This is a slow sipper and it tends to keep the bowl a little warm as you try and draw out more and more flavor so keep it cool and you'll get more flavor at a trade of lower smoke volume, sadly.

As the bowl gets in to the bottom third the initial flavors deepen but they don't change much.  This isn't a complex blend by any means but it's another morning commute smoke that I find myself packing more often and it goes very well with black coffee.  Ive been drinking a Coasta Rican Tarrazu blend lately and it's a great intro to coffee/tobacco  pairing as the coffee is medium bodied and even my cheap Private Selection manages to have some cocoa notes and a bit of citrus.  Both of those flavors actually enhance the sweetness found in GE and further supports burley and black coffee being the breakfast of champions!

There's just enough nicotine here to be noticeable and, again, I think this is a perfect blend for your morning drive as its juuuust enough to take the edge off as you get cut off for the umpteenth time by someone who fails to realize that just because there's two pedals on the car that doesn't mean you have to be using either one all the time.

The colors on this blend didn't jump right out at me, rather they were really subtle when I couldn't find the taste first.  I see tan, orange, and green when smoking this blend.

Summary: want to try a blend that's been around for 60+ years? Got burley on your list but don't know where to start?  Want to branch out from aromatics but still have some sweetness in your smoke?  Need a neutral blend to break in your new pipe? Give Golden Extra a go and experience a very pleasant burley indeed.

linearone: Golden extra is my secret burley ace in the hole. If you like burley at all you will like its pleasant flavors. And to me its just that.. pleasant start to finish. Its cheap and really really like 5 steps above the pa , half half, old school drugstore brands. If you like ge try mac baren mixture flake ( my favorite) or scottish blend. I truly think they identical, i find the flake more flavorful.
--
misterzipp0: I'm glad you find it pleasant as well, it  seemed the most fitting adjective.

I've only had one bowl of Scottish mixture but I felt the dark fired (original MacB cavendish) was a little overpowering, I guess I expected it to be a "deeper" golden extra, maybe more molasses or something but it appears I'll need to have a few more bowls.
--
linearone: Try their flake. I get more of that bran cereal and molasses taste, imho

bluesytone: Great review! And a great blend as well

antiwittgenstein: Did you get a chance to smoke the Mac B London Mixture before it was shuttered a couple of years ago? If so, any comparison you can make?
--
misterzipp0: I never did, heard it was similar.  There's a few tins kicking about, I might grab one next time I'm around one.
--
antiwittgenstein: I really enjoyed it, it felt like the perfect medium point between the C&D type heavyweights and Prince Albert. I have Symphony somewhere in my cellar, but looks like I am going to have a swing at Golden Extra sometime soon. Thanks for leading the way.

PeskyPrussian: Vernor's? Are you a Michigander? 
--
misterzipp0: Was, still have family near Lansing.  I'm so glad someone got the reference!
--
PeskyPrussian: The Vernor's in the nose sensation is inherently tied to my childhood. Excellent review by the way, I appreciate the effort that goes into an in depth, well written and entertaining review. 
--
misterzipp0: Thanks, I really appreciate that. Yea, once you get Vernors in your nose you *never* forget that taste!
