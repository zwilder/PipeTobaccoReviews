Review: Capstan Original Navy Cut
By: soymilkisgood

**Blend Name:** Capstan Original Navy Cut

**Tin Description:** A medium to mild blend of carefully selected Virginia tobaccos with a natural aroma.

**Leaf:** Virginia

**Appearance:** Light to medium colored flake tobacco. Very similar in appearance to the gold version. Maybe a little darker? Good moisture level – like Dunhill Flake and less like some of the more moist McClellands or Samuel Gawith flakes that I smoke.

**Tin Aroma:** Hay, grass – a typical straight Virginia flake scent. In any case it is very pleasant and light, not overwhelming in any way. Very straightforward light woodiness.

**Taste:** Ever so slightly sweet, a little grassy on the tongue. Little bit of wood chip flavor in the nicest way. Awesome straight Virginia. Not overly complex, but flavors develop as the bowl progresses. It reminds me of a very high quality vanilla bean ice cream in the best possible way. Maybe a tiny, tiny bit of spice in the very back of the room to round out the taste.

**Strength and Nicotine:** Good medium body. Pretty much what you’d expect from a Virginia flake. It’s there, but won’t smack you over the head with Vitamin N.

**Smokeability:** For those of you who are familiar with beer terms, it’s extremely “sessionable”. Not overwhelming in flavor in any way, and tastes great so you can smoke it in a few different pipes and get different experiences. Good stuff all around.

**Room Note:** Autumn in the room. Little bit of sweetness, decomposing leaves…very nice. Like other straight Virginias.

**Thoughts:** A medium Virginia that has some deeper notes (on the light side, if that makes any sense) that I could smoke all day. 

**Recommend to:** Someone who likes straight Virginias, an aromatic smoker who wants to delve a bit more into Virginias, someone who wants to try flake tobaccos.

**Summary:** Great Virginia with just the right balance of natural, savory flavors and sweetness that you might expect. It is plant matter flavors in their purest, most unadulterated form. A wonderful Straight Va flake. Could see this becoming one of my favorites.

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a few weeks ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and the only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is one of many that I'll be doing as part of the program.

====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thanks, I have 2 tins on the way myself, I'm really looking forward to it.

====================================
scriptonic: I like this one, I think the yellow tin is a bit better though. good review thx
--
soymilkisgood: I'd probably agree with you. Appreciate it!

====================================
None: I've always wonder if Capstan Original Navy Cut available in the States is in a way different than the Capstan available here in Europe.

Many reviewers here in PipeTobacco talk about 'citric tones' or, like in this case, 'Hay, grass – a typical straight Virginia flake scent'.

I've never noticed the former (as you can notice in Erinmore flake, for example), and the latter sounds to me like a description of FVF but not Capstan.

Here in Europe Capstan (blue tin) has a very distinguishable honey aroma.
--
soymilkisgood: Maybe I didn't notice it as much. It is definitely sweet out of the tin.
--
Formaldehydeontoast: Where are you in Europe? The irritating irony is that for an British blend we can only get pouched ready rubbed in the UK, I've been looking for tins but i'd have to order online from abroad.
--
None: I'm in Spain.

I'm sorry to hear that Capstan flake tins aren't available in the UK.

Here we don't have that kind of problem for now, and the tin price is just fine (6,80 euros). But I'm afraid of the general crazy policies against tobacco, so I'm stocking up all the tins I can. My TAD is only getting worse*!
--
Formaldehydeontoast: Daaaaamn. Over here a pouch of ready rubbed runs at equal to 18,00 euros. 
--
====================================
Elvandar1: I love this one. Too bad it's unavailable now in the Netherlands. 

And since the value of the euro has come very close to the dollar. It's not that lucrative anymore to order it from 4noggins. Unless I get a huge case of TAD.
