Tobacco Review: Captain Black Royal
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #38

**Blend Name:** Captain Black Royal

**Description on Tin:** Captain Black Royal is one of the best-selling pipe tobaccos in the world, and it’s no wonder why. This blend is a smooth mixture of golden and Black Cavendishes with a pleasantly light and sweet flavor that satisfies at any time of day.
 
**Leaf:** Short brown and black ribbon.

**Tin Aroma:** Rich rum raisin cake, sweet shoppe, vanilla, coconut, custard

**Taste:** Coconut and chocolate, hanging onto vanilla. Pecan sandies and caramel come to mind. Occasionally through the bowl it is very, very sweet – like a sugar tipped cigarillo. More sweets, vanilla custard, again some caramel flavor there. Mind you, you are gonna have to smoke very, very slowly to get this kid to sing.

**Smokability:** Dried it a bit and it smoked just fine. It does bite. Particularly at the relights at the end of the bowl.

**Room Note:** Vanilla and rum. Rather low key about it too.

**Thoughts:** My 1st of the Captain Black series and I was quite surprised about how much I liked it. It really impressed me on how distinctly it could deliver flavors. With the caveat that I was very, very patient.

**Similar Tobaccos:** MacBaren 7 Seas, Sutliff Barbados Plantation

**Summary:** Solid caramel aromatic with a deep noticeable sweetness.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** +

Cycleoflife: You lost me at Grape Nuts. I miss those little nuggets of malty nourishment.

vatothe0: I'm hung up on that now too, especially with raisin bran up at the top.

lightningserpent: I started with captain black royal. It was "ok", but didn't really do it for me. Then I came to /r/pipetobacco to see what I was doing wrong and found a while world of tobacco just waiting to be discovered.

it is worth stating that I didn't even finish that pouch...

ColinOnReddit: The only proper way to eat chex is roasted with butter, nuts, and those weird bread/crouton medallions. Not with milk in a bowl, you abominable oaf.

On a serious note, has anyone actually aged captain black, white? Its a fairly decent blend and definitely worth the value.

vatothe0: Throw some Worcestershire sauce in there. Mmm.

====================================
None: Well, I happen to like it very much.

bigcat318: This was my very first tobacco when I got my very first pipe in February of this year. It was one of few tobaccos that my local store had so I wasn't expecting it to be very good.

I was still figuring out packing techniques and how the whole pipe smoking thing worked, so I had no idea what to expect for taste, smell, room note, whatever. I think we all remember our first pipe tobacco? 

Anyways, it's mid-June and I'm still no expert, but I've tried about 6 different tobaccos. After letting the Royal dry out it smoked much better than when I bought it. I'm fairly certain it's because it dried out and not because I was a total noob. 

Anyways, I quite liked it in the end. However I still can't seem to taste anything when smoking pipes. Does anybody have any tips? My pipe is a Dr. Grabow Omega, I've smoked Captain Black Royal, McClelland; Just Plain Nut, VBC, Rum Toddy, Georgia Cream, and another unknown brand of Rum Butter. I've read on here that aromatics won't have a noticeable taste.

antiwittgenstein: That is, sadly the size of it. Some tips:

1. Try non-aromatics. Grab a balkan blend (Sutliff Bosphorous Cruise is my go to right now, but everyone has their favorite), a VaPer(H&H Anniversary Kake and Orlik Golden Sliced are good places to start), and a traditional English (Dunhill 965 is nearly the definition of). These have distinct, bold flavors that you won't need a flashlight and a shovel to find.
2. Try the breath smoking technique: put the pipe your mouth and breath through your nose. Don't pull. Every 2-3 breaths, exhale. Works wonder on aros.
3. Develop your palate. This takes more time, but really get into tasting everything - coffee, beer, whisky, your food, tea, smoke some cigars. The more things you taste the more you will be able to taste the things you taste.

bigcat318: Hey thanks for the tips! I'm trying to develop a palate with tobacco and whiskey right now. I've managed to do it with beer so I'm sure I can do it again with those two things. Thanks again! I'm going to try some of those that you recommended
