Quick review of Cult Blood Red Moon

Damn... now I need to buy a pipe to dedicate to Aros.
====================================
hvywldrnss: Yeah. I'm always on the hunt for an aromatic that I can enjoy from time to time, and this is definitely one of them. I ended up dedicating my Country Gentleman cob to it. 
--
carnesy: Tastes like tiramizu cake with a bit of cherry liquor mixed in. I could definitely see this as an after dinner/dessert smoke.
--
hvywldrnss: Exactly! In all honesty though this is the only cherry aromatic I have tried. I've been told not to bother chasing a better one. 
--
carnesy: My first cherro too. Used it to "pop the cherry", as it were, on my IMP Meerwardern. It's so well done that it seems like it could mix with a good vanilla aro (MB VC), or a good chocolate one.
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: Just as well, I hear cherry aros ghost like Poltergeist. I've got a tin of this and I'm trying to figure out which of my pipes will never host an English, VA, or VaPer again.
--
carnesy: Why put yourself through the pain of such a choice? This is a perfect excuse to scratch that PAD itch.
--
chewsyourownadv: I just elected to empty the tobacco out of some of my mason jars and send it to others so that I could store my new tobacco, rather than buy new jars. That PAD itch is just going to have to burn through me.
