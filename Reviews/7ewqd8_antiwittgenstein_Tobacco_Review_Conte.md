First I have to say: Thank you. Thank you all so much for participating and making this sub come alive with great, insightful, often hilarious pipe tobacco reviews. There have been over 30 pipe tobacco reviews this month! 30! That is roughly what /r/pipetobacco sees in a year. So again, I am overwhelmed and exhilarated by the outpouring of reviews, thank you.

That is the litany with one week to go. If you wrote a review you think I missed, please ping me with the link to your review. I've tried to stay on top of things, but links can fall through the cracks.

Remember, samples go to those with the 5 most reviews, and those with the 5 best reviews. So even if you haven't written one, you can get yourself some Stonehaven by writing one standout review.

Keep em coming and good luck.
====================================
levins0: Oh, thanks, but I really didn't do it for the giveaway. Don't add me to the list. Let others try to win the samples. It's awesome that you did this, and I think it really added to the sub to see so many new reviews.

antiwittgenstein: Right on, good of you to recuse yourself like that. That was a good, i.e. potentially expensive, review you posted of some blends so many of us were intrigued by.
