Best tobacco review I've ever read

I happen to disagree... but what Richard F said about Semois last year gave me a chuckle.

It's on for $20/brick right now btw.

====================================
PhysicsNovice: It burns hot. I hydrated mine a bit and smoke it slow.

levins0: Yeah you have to be careful with it. You also need to really pack it tight... Tighter than you think, and tighter than any other blend. It's so dry that if it isn't packed tightly it'll just burn up in seconds.   :)
--
hvywldrnss: Yes literally seconds.
--
star_boy2005: Is this a general truism about pipe tobacco? The dryer it is the tighter one should pack it?
--
levins0: Hmm... Well, I'm not really sure. I mean, when you think about it, if it's very dry and loosely packed, it'll burn quite hot and fast, as opposed to smoldering if it's tightly packed or more moist.  So just based on the rules of making fire, I would think it would be generally true. 

--
star_boy2005: That may be the explanation I've been looking for, for why my new favorite pipe packing technique, recently demonstrated by u/briarboy, which results in an extremely loose pack, has been working so successfully for me, given the fact that I tend to smoke very moist tobaccos.

====================================
chewsyourownadv: That's only because it's like smoking pure testosterone.
--
====================================
rugby411: I guess I'm not packing it tight enough, 'cause when I'm at the dog park, I light it up, step outta the truck, get the dog, and it's finished...pack tighter I guess....
--
MetalEd: Yes. . Pack it 20x tighter than you think you can.  Pack it until it will barely draw
