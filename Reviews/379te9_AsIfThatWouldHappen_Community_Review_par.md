Community Review participation encouragement.

I opened my tin of Frog On The Bayou lastnight and started smoking for the upcoming review.
I won't review it here but I will say it is fantastic, so don't wait until after the review to get some, grab a tin and join in.
It is good to gauge your experiences against others with the same smoke and maybe pick up on a tip or two to get a better experience out of your tobaccos if your review seems to be an odd one out in the flavor department.

The community review is a wonderful idea and it's fun, so don't be shy and join in, that means you newbies here too, it's a great way to dip your toes in the reviewing pool.
We only had minimal participation last review :(
====================================
Chuzordie: I'd love to participate ,  but my funds for tobacco are scarce and limited.  even a bowl in the mail would be something the wife and I could share a pipe over to try with you guys.

levins0: I got you covered.  Stand by!

====================================
Mordenkrad: I don't like english blends so I don't see the point in buying one to say how much I don't like it. Sorry. If we have more VA/Burlies I'd participate more.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Obviously thats a great reason for an exception. 
Don't smoke it against your will and preferences then rate it one star like some people on Tobaccoreviews do haha.

I hope I didn't sound condescending or rude in my encouragement, I was just hoping to help people over the line of they were on the fence for joining in.

PipeBeard: That tin note

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Having a bowl right now, it's smells so good.

PipeBeard: It's smell like cocoa :)

lightningserpent: I realize it is simple enough to look at other reviews and format from that, but it might encourage participation if there was a format letter or fill-in-the-blank type form to look at when doing the review.

People could go "off script" if they wanted, but it would also give others an idea of what to say regarding the tobacco qualities. If this is available somewhere I missed it last time. I did my best, but it was daunting to type up a review when I realized I had no idea what to say about the tobacco beyond: "Dis is good stuff right here".

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thats a good point, in the sidebar there is a tobacco review template that gives some good 'categories' to give your thoughts on.
It can be as simple as  'smelled sweet and smoky' to something uber extravagant that just means the same thing but is 2 paragraphs long.

I can't link it on my phone, but if you find it, link it here, and just do little dot points in your head when you have a bowl and fill out the template in your mind and it will come up with a good review :)

Ciceronian: I've been lurking around this sub for far too long and have been trying to engage a little more of late. Just loaded up a bowl of Froggy on the Bayou and will capture some thoughts for the community review, for sure.

====================================
tribial: I ordered a tin of the Balkan blue (too late) on the Bayou and Fire Dance. I plan on participating but not exactly sure how to do a review yet. Thanks for the reminder. I will pack a bowl to ight to practice!
