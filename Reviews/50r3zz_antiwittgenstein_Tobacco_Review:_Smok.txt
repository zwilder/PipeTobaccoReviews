Tobacco Review: Smoker's Haven Select Mixture
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 75

**Blend Name:** Smoker’s Haven Select Mixture
 
**Description on Tin:** Not too fond of large amounts of Latakia and Turkish? You’re gonna love our Select Mixture. Mild, slow burning, dry smoking with just enough Latakia and Turkish to pique your interest. All of this takes place within a piquant, matured Virginia Base.

**Leaf:** Brown spongey shag
 
**Tin Aroma:** Nutty with a faint sweetness

**Taste:** Hay, earth, oatmeal, nutty. A very mild bready sweetness. A few puffs in you get blindsided by a wave of mouth-tingling Vinegar. Hard and sharp, like a mean Virginia, or I suspect here, an exceptionally bright variant of oriental. On this wave comes an accompanying heat, not like pepper, but something more purely spice. There are a bit of other underlying tastes. A bit of very faint savoury notes, something onion-garlic, but milder, so shallots I guess. And mustard, or really horseradish, but without the icepick to the nasal passages, but that same sort of flavor and heat. This is a hot sauce for your pipe. There is a tiny bit of Latakia in there too, but it lends just a mild smoke that you really have to go searching for, and with it the faints whiffs of lavender I seem to get from the stuff. It is not soapy at all which I always appreciate. There is very little actual development after that initial blast, it just layers up and up, where every new flavor is an addition, not a replacement.

**Nicotine:** 2-3. Curiously mild for the level of flavor it delivers.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** It is a cinch to pack – just grab a tuft and plug it into your pipe, a perfect bowl every time. The ash this stuff produces is very fine and dense, so you have to dump your ashes aggressively before it snuffs itself out.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside but the sidestream seemed more nutty than anything.

**Age when smoked:** About 6 months.

**Thoughts:** This is a pretty impressive Balkan blend. Or at least I think it is supposed to be Balkan. Let me look up the description… oh I guess that was really bright Virginia, not so much on the oriental. Or who knows. 

I was surprised when I first loaded this in my pipe. As many of you know, this tobacco came as a free sample with the /r/pipetobacco POTY and I had assumed they would have stuck us with a couple of aromatics. I even loaded it up in my aro pipe that first go. I was very quiet taken aback when it was this intense flavorful English with nary a vanilla or mango or anise note to be found. But I was converted pretty quick and now I like this stuff enough that I will make it a point to try the rest of their line, even when it actually costs me money.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Balkan Sobraine, Balkan Sasieni, Sutliff Bosphorous Cruise
 
**Summary:** A spicy-vinegar mild on the smoke Balkan in a delightful shag cut.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

SupraMario: Awesome review, I like the nicotine rating. That will help out a lot of people too. Keep these going always excited to see your next review pop up on here

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! That is a pretty recent addition, but I think it gives at least some semi-quantitative measure of how hard a blend will hit.
--
SupraMario: O yeah I've been following all of your reviews, they are great, the nicotine rating makes them even better

====================================
circa1905: Well done.  I like your style.  Of the SH blends, my top three are 1. 20th Anniversary Mixture, 2. Exotique, and 3. Our Best Blend.  
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! Usually it is my job to encourage people here to spend their money, but I appreciate you returning the favor.

====================================
notmynamebutreally: Great review! Do SH's "Our Best Blend" next!
--
antiwittgenstein: I don't have any of that about yet - if you do, PM me about a trade.

====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Great review. Ive never wanred wanted to try a tobacco with notes of shallots and horseradish but now i do lol
--
antiwittgenstein: I haven't yet gotten to my McC oriental blends, but I have found most Balkanish blends have either Woodsy flavors (e.g. C&D Oriental Silk) or Savoury notes that taste like hummus ingredients, like those blends mentioned above. They are pretty light in this one, but try either of the BS's or some of the Sutliff Balkans (BC and 957 Luxury are both great and fairly interchangeable).

BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Cool thanks! Love your reviews
