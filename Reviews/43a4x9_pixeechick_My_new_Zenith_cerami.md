====================================
OldManPhill: Beautiful pipe, hows it smoke?
--
pixeechick: No troubles so far! The chamber seems to add a nice place for the smoke to cool and dry out.

====================================
pixeechick: This is my new ceramic pipe that I picked up at [Sievert's Tobacco](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/sieverts-limited/Location?oid=1618886) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, along with some Germain's Brown Flake and Germain's Special Latakia Flake. At $38 CAD/tin they were a bit pricey, but considering local taxes, about right. 

Christened it with some of the brown flake on a stroll around the farm yesterday during the first above-freezing day in weeks. Pipe smoked lovely and dry, tobacco was good and easy. Only relight was after I put the pipe down to go in for coffee.

The pipe is essentially a calabash with a rubber stopper keeping the army-style mount tight. Cleaning is done as you would with a coffee mug (soap and water) and shaken out. Apparently this will colour over time like a meer. 

Light, smokes well and dry, easy to clean, not a bad looking piece, either. Considering the pipe ($35) was less than the tobacco in price, I'd say it was a good deal all around.

actually_a_tomato: Looks great! How hot does it get?
--
pixeechick: Well, out in the snow it was pleasantly warm in the hand. It's got a double wall, so right now it's okay. I'll have to follow up once the weather warms to see if it's any different in warmer weather.

====================================
tribial: Is there a major flavor difference compared to a cob or a briar?
--
pixeechick: It doesn't seem to have the sweetness of a cob, but I'll have to side-by-side it with a cob to say for sure.

====================================
sparky787: Great. Now I want one. 
--
pixeechick: You should want one. That would be smart. 
--
sparky787: I am smart, I want one.

====================================
TheHobbitPimp: I looooove ceramics and clays. And yours is gorgeous too!
--
pixeechick: They had one with the blue printing on it like [the bottom left picture in this link](http://www.pijpenkabinet.nl/Smokiana/04-E%20Zenith.html), along with a few others with clear and coloured glazes on them. Lots of variety in shapes to suit many preferences.

 I am looking forward to giving it a second run very soon.
--
pixeechick: I picked up a pocket-sized clay that I haven't tried yet. I really should give that next preference as I have lots of flying ahead and there's no guarantee it will survive.
--
TheHobbitPimp: If it is pocket-sized wear a shirt with a breast pocket and keep it there. 
--
pixeechick: That might work for you gents but I've got that space occupied ;)
--
TheHobbitPimp: Safest place is between the breasts. Just not while hot. Source: fat man.
--
pixeechick: Ouch. Yeah, I guess not. I'll have to fashion a cleavage pocket somehow...
--
TheHobbitPimp: You have a great pocket, assuming you wear bras.
--
pixeechick: Unfortunately those pockets are full. I need something for the gap. A cleavage holster of some kind....
