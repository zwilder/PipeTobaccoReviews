Another Stonehenge review & smoking tips

====================================
pipeandpendulum: 
I wanted to smoke a few bowls of this before I shared my thoughts.  But Im with xjer8888 and Rusty on this one, its QUITE good. 

I let my flakes dry for about an hour or 9o minutes, then broke them up and gravity filled my bowl.  Like any flake it takes a little bit of effort to get it going, but once you get it evenly burning, you are good to go; and relax with it.  

Lakeland - shes here, but wayyy way in the backround, and only drops by a few times through the whole bowl, (for me anyways).   Otherwise Im getting a lot of earthy tobacco flavor and perique.  This for me was partly remiscent of Germains Brown Flake, but with a little more flavor, and a little less burley or "cigarrete taste".   Stonehenge is also great through the retrohale.  As xjer8888 said there is a tad bit of citrus and sweetness. 

This (like most flakes) is best smoked in a pot shape; wide open bowl.  Gravity fill the bowl to the rim or just a bit above the rim whatever your preference, and push down lightly with a tamper or your thumb.  Youll get through the whole bowl with few or no relights.  Its rare to get bite from flake tobacco, but its worth mentioning, that you cant get this one to bite. 

Lastly, this is going to be an oustanding candidate for aging a few years I think.  Perhaps not 10 years but give it maybe 4-6 and it will really shine.  Any longer and the flavor might start to decay.  But Im only guessing here.  Overall this is an excellent new tobacco.  Get some, because although they say its not limited,  the deeming regs may make it go away.

xjer8888: Great review and some good tips. I would fully agree on the aging though judging from what I experienced yesterday with the comparison. I'm glad to see everyone is enjoying it, it's always great to see something like this get the pipe community excited.
