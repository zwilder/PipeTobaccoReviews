Tobacco Review: Samuel Gawith English Summer Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 71

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith’s English Summer Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** A slow-burning and delicate smoke for when the season's hot, the English Summer blend is composed simply of pure Virginia, long-aged and unadulterated. As with the rest of the Four Seasons series, we have not only Samuel Gawith to thank for this flake, but also the blending expertise of Czech entrepreneur and lover of all things tobacco, Dr. Josef Stanislav.

**Leaf:** Medium length flake of a yellow and brown hue.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Candle wax, Maple syrup, sweet, rye whisky, caramel

**Taste:** Oh boy. Lakeland round 2. My [first foray]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/34sc86/tobacco_review_brown_flake_unscented/) didn’t go so well, but this is not nearly as overpowering. Candle wax sure, but underneath there is sweetness, first sort of brown sugar, some hay, crisp bright Virginia. A bit spicy which was unexpected. Some maltiness that mixes well with the sweetness. Every once in awhile I will get a solid puff without the wax, but it is, at least to my palate, the dominate note. Lemonade, sweet and tangy, with a bit of salt in there to bring out the sugar.  For a bit there it reminds me of Mac Baren’s Virginia No. 1 or SG Medium Virginia Flake but with just a dash of pepper and of course, Lakeland poison. Towards the end it begins to deepen, some stewed fruits, plums we’ll say, come on, and it grows the tiniest bit woodsy. I tire of the wax so I don’t really ever see this one out to the end.

**Nicotine:** 2-3

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Ovedried not so bad. It produces a beautiful white ash. Can be folded (or shattered considering its brittle state now) and stuffed, but smaller chunks create a denser pack which burns much better.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside but I smell faintly cigaretty and bit floral.

**Thoughts:** Thank you /u/pixeechick for the sample – but I still hate Lakeland. This was fairly bearable compared to the ‘Unscented’ Flake by the other Gawith and I smoked through several bowls of the stuff, but I am going to pass on the remaining flake I have to someone who might enjoy it, and go scrub down my Virginia Pipe.

They say it is isn’t scented. Well they lied to you. Just like they lie when they call anything in England ‘Summer.’

Now a lesson of what **Not** to do: 

I had an incredibly bright idea which turned into an incredibly dumb idea because I did not know that these pretty like flakes were packed with Lakeland Candle Goo. Between trades, bombs and the Box Pass I had a bunch of small samples which I did not have jars for and too much of it to smoke before it all dried out on me. I have a spare humidor that I keep these samples in just for neatness. What if I plopped some humidification in there? It was almost a brilliant idea and I would have gotten away with it if it wasn’t for you meddling kids. My tobaccos did stay amazingly moist. And all of them – well the ones I have smoked so far – have had a faint candlewax glow to them. I threw out a couple of bags before I realized I could dry the stuff out and the wax would go – but then I have crispy shards again, which I was trying to avoid. But I smoke my baccy on the dry side, so this isn’t that much of a bother.

So if you ever have the same *bright* idea as I at least make sure all the blends you have are of the same species at least and you don’t mind the flavors intermingling. In fact you could use these powers for good – perhaps put a bag of Squadron Leader or some such in the same humidor as 1Q and maybe after a week 1Q will finally taste like something.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Poisoned SG Medium Virginia Flake, Poisoned Mac Baren Va No. 1, Poisoned Newminster Superior Navy Flake, Less poisonous G&H Unscented Brown Flake
 
**Summary:** Candle wax and lemonade 

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
Dunning-Kruger-: Despite your scurrilous remarks about English Summers (we invented Summer you philistine !) I am curious about whether the aromas are a consequence of the Samuel Gawith 'effect' (it has been claimed that, like a fine Islay malt (ok the 'fine' was superfluous they are all fine !) the contents of the containers (fine phrase) will pick up the odours of their surroundings and, thus, the lakeland essences) rather than a deliberate casing ?


All the reviews pick up a lakeland or rosehip essence but, according to Sam G. himself the virginia is purely uncased ?

antiwittgenstein: I think it is very hard to divorce aroma and taste - however the experience is one on the tongue, which despite my seasonal allergies trying their best to depress my senses, I experience full bore. I have smoked this outside, so the side stream and room note are lost on me - just what goes into my mouth.

I noticed that too - I looked up tobaccoreviews myself to make sure that this was indeed the offender out of my box of troubles. I know G&H (whom I avoid if at all possible now) use the same machinery, without cleaning it out, between scented and unscented products, so even the *unscented* stuff is Lakeland befouled. Perhaps SG is not immune to this as well?
--
Dunning-Kruger-: Yep - that was something I suspected too ! 


I shall have to give it a try, I've not really tried a Lakeland so I may go all out and get some Ennerdale as well :)

====================================
hicetnunc37: Thanks for the heads up and a very nice review. I will avoid it like plague. I have one estate pipe where they smoked that nasty Lakeland stuff in, it took 3 salt treatments, a bake with activated charcoal and about 30 bowls of burley to chase it out. I think it's still there 
What do you guys find  so appealing in SG blends? I don't see much to outweigh the difficulty of smoking. 
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Not all of the SG tobaccos have that "lakeland essence."  FVF is one of my favorites and it is lakeland-free.

It took me nearly an entire tin on 1792 smoked over a six month period (most bowls were dumped mid-way through) to finally appreciate the lakeland essence but once I did it started to grew on me for the little of the tin that remained.
--
bonehed: Check out Lakeland Dark - 1792 minus the tonquin.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Actually, it wasn't the tonquin that bothered me it was the floral/soapy notes.  At least I think so.  This is confusing because others have said there are no floral/soapy essences in 1972.  Perhaps they are there and just very mild, but to me they were overwhelming.  I've never smoked a lakeland with a pronounced floral/soapy essence so unfortunately I don't have anything to compare with here.  Is there any light you might be able to shed here?

As an aside, while I did come to quite enjoy 1792 by the time I got to the last bowl and learn to appreciate the flavors that I was having troubles with at first, I know for sure that I would never want them in any greater levels, whatever they are.

--
bonehed: I'd consider 1792 extremely mild (essence-wise) compared to the staples of the genre. It may take some time, but they've certainly grown on me.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Ok.  Thanks for the confirmation.  Right now, that extremely mild level is about as much of it as I can take!

--
antiwittgenstein: Eh, this is a hobby, and like all hobbies, is enjoyable through, not despite its frustrations. When SG or McC flakes are good, they are some of the best smokes I have ever had. And when they are wet, they are the worst. Like dating a girl with a chemical imbalance - there are going to be bad days aplenty, but the good times, you hope, more than make up for the hassle.
--
ChemEng: Perfect anology.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: What makes it even more frustrating is that if you dry out some tobaccos like FVF out too much you start losing flavor as well.  But when you nail it just right the result is indeed divine.

====================================
tankbuster183: confession: came here for the rating scale.

Good review too.

====================================
Chuzordie: Of the few SG lakeland blends I have tried,  Grousemoor is rather nice. I have been wanting to get more SG lakelands to try and find one that I could puff on long term.  
--
Chuzordie: I found it.. my grousemoor cob!  have to keep it seperate but its a smell that I enjoyed.
