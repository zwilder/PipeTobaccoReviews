Need Help finding an Old pipe review channel

About 5 years ago I came across this guy on YouTube that talked about and reviewed pipes. He had a big beard, and kind of looked like your average pipe-smoker. There are two videos I distinctly remember, one where he tried a cigar for the first time and had no idea how to cut it, and one where he talked about his dentist routine. His videos were good so I'm trying to find them even though I don't smoke. 

I think the name was like "PipeAndFriends" or something like that. If anyone remembers this then please tell me, I'm irrationally going insane. Thank you
====================================
carnesy: PipefriendCHS. He took down almost all his videos.

cybersubzero240: Yep thats him. Wonder why he decided to do that. 
--
carnesy: I recall that he only smoked a few pipes, and only really smoked C&D's Billy Bud and kinda ran out of things to talk about on the pipe side. Also I believe he was looking to make some life changes and wanted to go about doing so in private. As to why he removed all his old videos I can't recall.

lord_garrett: Aw man. He was such an interesting fellow too. He was a big Viking guy from the Netherlands IIRC, transplanted here to one of the Carolinas. Listened to techno music. Played MMOs. Smoked HUGE pipes and like you said, smoked C&D Billy Bud almost exclusively. 
--
carnesy: I thought he was originally a Canadian... Maybe Carolinas by way of Canada by way of the Netherlands? Either way he was a Ginger.
--
lord_garrett: Maybe? I feel like I remember him making a video where he wasn't used to the hot weather of the American South. And also he mentioned it was weird being a gay man in the Bible Belt. 

I'm not just making this up am I? The dude's been off youtube for like five years so I can barely remember. Too bad we can't just go back and watch. I miss that guy's videos.

hello_josh: How old was the guy? Did he film indoors, outdoors? Any other things you remember about the YouTuber?
--
cybersubzero240: Probably early 30s, the videos I remember were indoor. In a living room/kitchen interior. Not a super low or high voice.
