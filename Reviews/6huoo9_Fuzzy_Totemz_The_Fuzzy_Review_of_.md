The Fuzzy Review of Bob's Chocolate Flake (and an editorial on B&Ms)
By: Fuzzy_Totemz

I've been branching out into Virginias due to return samples from WWYLTT. From Golden Slices to Dunhill Flake, I've been running the gambit from "pleasant but unimpressed" to "goddamn I have to light this shit again?!?!"  
  
Worst experience was drawing on my Sav without cleaning between smokes. It was like liquid lawn clippings, right in the mouth.  
  
I had surmised from my flake experiences that I would probably try a ribbon cut next since my "pack, char, tamp, light, smoke the entire bowl" method would probably work better with a ribbon.  
  
So here's the story, I go into a local B&M in a strip mall (a TB franchise) and mostly they sell gaudy trinkets and knives versus tobacco (since no lounge). However, they do actually have Bob's Flake in a jar.  
  
I'm there for a blending component used to make something I sent u/SupraMario and u/RustyShackleFord09 as test samples.  (test batch of "Fuzzy Joe")
  
Human engineering is important guys. Introduce yourself to the staff. Ask them how it's going (if they aren't visibly perturbed). Make sure they know you are a buyer and plan to buy. (I'm going to need a few ounces of something and I already know what it is).  
  
Then you ease in the "I wish I could try that Bob's Flake, but there isn't much left in the jar and the flakes look broken. Could I buy a quarter ounce?"  
  
"Well, we can't do samples technically."  
  
"I hear you man, total shame. I'd love to come back in and buy some though if I liked it. I just don't want to buy a whole ounce and find out I don't."
  
Then I shift off the topic and we talk the mall business vs the lounge business, etc.   
  
I get some Sav filters too.  Then we get to the "so this is it, we ringing up?"  
  
"Unless you can find a way to sell me a sample of the Flake bro? Because you'd make my week. And it's been a week man."  
  
He goes to the back, brings out a brand new block of the flake. Cuts a hunk off. Puts it in a bag. And no-charges it.   I still know that cat's name.  
  
So, Bob's Chocolate Flake. I smoked it blindly because I didn't want bias in my tasting notes. I assumed the Chocolate was meant to indicate color.  
  
It was softer and smoother than OGS and seemed to balance the hay/grass notes out. It was a great smoke! It had the same "will this shit stay lit?" issue I have with other flakes that I'll just have to learn to pack better to solve probably.  
  
**If Orlik Golden Slices is a White Guy Barbershop Quarter VA flake, then Bob's Chocolate is soft jazz in a New Orleans bar with no vocals.**  (that's me giving an actual useful metaphoric review versus a JimInks word salad)
  
After smoking, I read that it's cased in cocoa and dressed with some too. Which surprised me. This is not some "hot gurgly chocolate aromatic made to sell in bulk jars to rubes". It seems whatever cocoa notes they use are light on sugars and just give some yin to the Virginia yang. It smooths the smokes versus announcing itself.  
   
I would highly recommend Bob's Flake and highly recommend you visit your B&M's, give them a chance, be nice, and work them like they are a merchant versus a walmart.  Make friends with you B&Ms. Some B&M's (like the infamous Tobacco Corner in Memphis) are staffed by assholes. I get it. Some B&M's basically shove you onto the internet.  Be cool, be nice, and move on if they aren't cool with you.  
    
Peace guys.

Dunning-Kruger-: You sound terrible - I would have barred you on sight :)


PS I love Bob's Choc Flake but I always pay for it - especially from shops who are probably struggling given the draconian legislation around baccy !

Fuzzy_Totemz: I would definitely pay for it now that I've tried it. The stuff that was at the bottom of the jar they had out looked like hair clippings though.   
  
Not only did he hook me up, he opened a fresh block that wasn't covered in cooties.

====================================
givemeyours0ul: Nice post. I'll never understand B&Ms that don't seem to "get' retail. You don't want me in your store? Fine, fuck-you-kindly then. I'll take my cellar budget back to SP.  
Same guys probably bitch to their few regulars how hard it is to keep the doors open.

Fuzzy_Totemz: Scuba stores largely have that "fuck you and the internet too" attitude. I tried to get my local dive shop to move into the internet age gracefully but they got stuck in the DEMA fortress model of continuing to just milk new trainees for outrageous amounts of MSRP gear.  
  
They feel entitled from decades of no competition.

====================================
Roadside: I've had multiple instances where shop owners just don't seem to want my money and only seem to exist for their dozen or so regulars. Not frequently, but on occasion. Like if I don't know your super secret handshake my money is no good-- very strange.  

I've been mocked because of my taste in cigars on one occasion, on another, I got an eye roll and dismissal when I asked where their pipe related stuff was (they specifically advertised they cater to pipe smokers). These were places on the east coast, and I've since moved out west. 

I found a few local B&Ms I haven't been to in my area-- and I honestly want to pay them a visit, but I haven't been too inclined when the internet has been more than enough so far.

====================================
Old_Deadhead: I feel fortunate that the B&M's around me seem to understand that service and customer experience are what sets them apart and makes it worth me paying a higher price than online to keep coming back. 

Going that extra mile, including offering samples and reviews, are what keeps a quality B&M in business! 
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Amen bro.

====================================
four4adollar: My B&M sells 98% cigars. 2 giant walk-in humidors with cigars stacked in piles of the sales tables. Pipe tobacco is held hostage behind the counter. They told ne they are not going to stock much non-aromatic tobacco as I was primarily their largest customer. So I bought most of their stock of tins that were taking up valueuble retail space behind the counter for 50-80% off.
