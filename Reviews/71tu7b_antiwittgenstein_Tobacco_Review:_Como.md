Tobacco Review: Comoy's Cask No. 11
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 90

**Blend Name:** Comoy’s Cask No. 11
 
**Description on Tin:** Dusky orientals, bright Virginias, and dark, rich Latakias are combined in Comoy's "Cask No. 11" to create a mellow, flavorful Balkan blend of traditional style.

**Leaf:** Generic ribbon
 
**Tin Aroma:** Pungent smoke, something mustardy about it, peppery I guess. Assertive as a desperate real estate agent.

**Aged when smoked:** About 1 year

**Taste:** Salt and smoke. Something in the earthy-nutty vein underneath. Pleasant lemony sourness develops. The smoke is woody, both in the sort of wet oak taste and in the sense that the smoke is like good bbq wood type smoke, maybe most akin to mesquite. The occasional weird perfumy pull. The salt-lemon-smoke makes it lean toward a Balkan, but maybe shies away from being all out one thing or the other. Except as the smoke goes on, more savoury flavors arise, onions, dried herbs, basil and parsley and a little oregano, with a couple of generous cloves of garlic. Perfume again. Yuck. Artificial orange. I notice that the whole smoke has been just into sweet. Not outright sweet, but enough that the fruity flavors, when they come, aren’t dry or out of place. But not sweet enough to taste odd with the smoke or sautéed herb flavors either. Hashish. Now this is a Balkan. Like a summer fling, tends to be a bit bitter as it nears the end. Just as hard to let go of too. It is integrated, savoury, less smoky, with a rising spice, with wood bitters and just the smack of lemon oil. I know I have been smoking dottle for ten minutes but it keeps going, thin wisps of intensely flavorful smoke.

**Nicotine:** 3, lighter end of the English pantheon

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** Easy to pack, light, and keep lit. Produces huge creamy smoke volume until it is in the dregs. It will probably bite you.
 
**Room Note:** N/A

**Thoughts:** What a surprising blend. It starts off so simple and straightforward, seemingly a more latakia forward analogue of Squadron Leader. Then ala Brad Majors it sheds its Clark Kent persona, throws on some Transylvanian lingerie, and transforms into a blaring Balkan. Astonishing, but maybe not something I might find myself reaching for often, not just because of the perfumy Latakia and distinct fear of tongue bite. When I want an English, I go full smoke’n’oak English, when I want Balkan, I want the howling kaleidoscopic intensity of a true Balkan. But with my favorite Sutliff blends being consigned to the tin heap of tobacco history, I might keep this around as an alternative. Or just to pass on to unsuspecting fellow smokers….
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** 
1st Half – SG Squadron Leader, C&D Mountain Camp
2nd Half – Sutliff Luxury Balkan 957, Sutliff Bosphorous Cruise, Balkan Sasieni
 
**Summary:** A simple English blend that evolves into a hugely flavorful Balkan

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

carnesy: Hey, where's my pumpkin spice sutliff review?! Holding out on it til October?
--
antiwittgenstein: Lulz. Haven't pulled the trigger on it yet. Let's see what happens after I sooth my throat with a few hot toddies.
--
carnesy: >Let's see what happens after I sooth my throat with a few hot ~~toddies~~ pumpkin spice lattes.

Let's be honest, I fixed that for ya ;P
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks ya bastard. I used to work at Starbucks and got to crave those things - but not so much that I will blow $5 a pop more than a few times. That is more than twice as much as an ounce of Sutliff Pumpkin Spice, which, sigh, I just bought. I'll try to get a review out quickly just for you. And to rip the bandaid off.
--
carnesy: Sorry?
--
antiwittgenstein: Never apologize for enabling your fellow smokers. Even when it could turn out gruesome.
--
carnesy: That's what the "?" was for. Also, if it turns out gruesome I definetally won't apologize.

====================================
PastorPuff: Nice write-up. I'm going to have to throw some of this on my next order.

====================================
SupraMario: You try Cast No. 4 Yet?
--
antiwittgenstein: Yes indeed, one of my favorites. I might have smoked more Cask No. 4 than any other blends.
--
SupraMario: Awesome! Yeah it's a favorite of mine also, and it was recently on sale from p&c so I grabbed 4oz of it in bulk for $8.
