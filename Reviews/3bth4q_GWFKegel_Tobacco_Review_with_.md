Tobacco Review with Photos: Doblone d'Oro by Savinelli
By: GWFKegel

====================================
GWFKegel: **Full disclosure**: I won this tin months ago in a contest that Savinelli was kind enough to sponsor. Also, /u/archimedesrex reviewed it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2vhr7e/tobacco_review_savinelli_doblone_doro/), and /u/antiwittgenstein [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2z1g0t/tobacco_review_savinelli_doblone_doro/).

The text from the descriptions in the photos:

**The Tin**

Opening the tin, I smell Virginias the most. It smells like tobacco and nothing else, a sort of pure blend without anything ornamenting or offending the nose. My tin was also at a great moisture level.

**The Doubloons**

Doblone d'Oro (Doubloon of Gold) is aptly named. The individual coins are roughly the size and thickness of an American quarter. They look like a mosaic of different tobaccos, coarsely rolled into coins. The coins break apart fairly easily, and in a packed tin it's difficult to get many coins out unbroken. Neither thing is a problem as it makes a good way to break apart the tobacco for easier packing.

**The Burn / Smoke**

After packing a bowl, the tobacco was fairly springy when being lit. It also kind crumbles when tamping it back down. However, once it's lit, it kept the flame fairly well. I only had to relight once in a large bowl while smoking outside. Depending on how much you smoke, and how quickly, it might get a bit damp toward the end of the smoke, and the nicotine from the tobacco may hit you about 30 minutes into the smoke. That's par for many tobaccos. And it definitely doesn't count against this in any way. Just good to note it.

**Final Opinion**

Doblone d'Oro is a solid tobacco. Much like the scent, the taste is mild. It tastes like a smooth Virginia and Burley mix with only minimal sweetness, and the Perique adds a spicy note.

So who should smoke this? Well, if you like hugely aromatic or flavorful tobaccos, I would not recommend this one. This blend is a smooth smoker, but it's light on the taste and unimpressive on the room note. 

BUT: Two types of smokers will definitely want to check this out. (1) If you're a fan of Virginia or Burley blends, this is definitely one that burns consistently, isn't too wet, and doesn't have an overwhelming sweetness. (2) If you've always wanted to try something with a notable part of Perique, but you've always been too cautious about it being overwhelming, this is a nice blend to taste what Perique does to a mix when balanced by other tobaccos.

BWeice: I'm drooling at the sight of it... To the must try list it goes

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Nice write up.
I have been waiting to buy a tin of this for ages, I'm slowly working my way down my wish list and it's getting close now.

GWFKegel: Thanks.

Remember value-wise that the tin is 100 g / 3.5 oz., or about twice many other tins. It makes the $20 price at [PipesAndCigars.com](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/pipe-tobacco/84003/savinelli-doblone-doro/) easier to justify. I hope you dig it.

pixeechick: This is one of my top 3 right now. It seems to prefer my cobs over my briars, but I'm not complaining. There's this one bent Legend I have it seems to be best friends with. 

Thanks for the review! If I haven't reviewed it yet I'll have to give it a shot.
--
GWFKegel: I didn't even think of smoking it in my cob. I'll have to try that out.
--
pixeechick: I'm not sure if it's the narrow chamber or the natural drying factor, but it's a great match. Only get about 2.5-3 coins in there, but it's just so perfect. I would often go this route on my commute home as it needed no fuss and was damn tasty.

archimedesrex: I love it to death!

TurnerJ5: Two thumbs up on this one. Love the addition of photos! 

Doblone is a great 'perique starter' indeed.
--
GWFKegel: Thanks! Yeah, the Perique is nicely balanced by the other tobacco in this one. It's not too spicy or overpowering, but it adds another dimension to a solid Virginia and Burley blend.

====================================
Pandam: You know, I've yet to try a Savinelli blend. I've mainly stuck to the majors in my short (4 mo) pipe experience... Dunhill, MM, Gawith, etc. This might have convinced me to branch out a bit more! Thanks for the review!
--
GWFKegel: You're welcome. I mean, there's lots of great blends out there. If you're only 4 months in, I think the tobacco gods will certainly understand you sticking to the fundamentals.

====================================
thesillyoldbear: One of my favourite Perique blends. I love that the VAs taste of lime instead of the usual orange/lemon/generic citrus.
--
GWFKegel: When you say "lime," do you mean like it's super mild in its acidity and just a hint bitter?
--
thesillyoldbear: No, I actually get a lot of lime (as in the small green lemons) flavour from it.
--
GWFKegel: I'll have to pay attention to that. Thanks for the tip.
