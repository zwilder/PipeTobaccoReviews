Review a day 23 (Flake week!): Samuel Gawith Full Virginia Flake
By: physicsyakuza
---
I hereby declare the rest of the week Flake week for no particular reason! Expect all flake reviews for the rest of the week!

Blend Name: Samuel Gawith Full Virginia Flake

Tin Description: Samuel Gawith Full Virginia Flake is for lovers of pure pressed Virginias. Created in the heart of Lakeland, the hot-pressed blended Virginias take on a delicious and distinctive dark colour that creates a pipe smokers dream, a feeling of calm, serenity and anticipation of the next pipeful. A "must have" for all Virginia lovers. Medium strength.

Aroma: The usual dried fruits

Appearance: Beef jerky

Slightly rubbed into my Savinelli Da Vinci Giochi Di Luce pipe. A nice, narrow, tall dublin. I bought this bulk FVF sometime in the last year, so it's not super old. This flake is super wet so dry it out! Only packed a half bowl too so as to save time.

Flavor:
Initial: Wow this blend is mellow. An almost butterscotch like sweetness pervades with minimal hay/grass notes (as I was expecting). Definite earthiness but there's a definite funk to this blend (a very fermented flavor). Take this one slow, I can already feel some bite just off the initial light. Although it seems once you get this one going it's pretty forgiving (unless it's sopping wet, did I mention you should DRY this flake?).

Mid: Lemon and citrus peel flavors starting to come out. Cookie like sweetness and oh so fresh tasting.

Final: Small bowl, so I suppose the mid is the final.

Thoughts: All and all I'm a bit underwhelmed with FVF, and I'm pretty sure this is because I've got a relatively fresh batch (at most 9 months old). I know this gets exponentially better with age, but I wanted to try it early to see how it evolves. Is the hype worth it? Not sure yet, I'll let you know in 5 years. Looking for a great tobacco now though? Try St. James Flake.

Edit: Clearly the consensus is don't dry it too much. Perhaps try varying levels of moisture until you find what works for you (although that can be a somewhat expensive experiment with the rarity of this stuff at times)

====================================
hedonaut: FVF is a fickle lover. Sometimes she's on fire, other times she's distant, cold, or even cruel. I have found th best prep is to cube cut a whole pile of it, let it dry overnight, then put it in a mason jar for a few days. On the rare occasion I see FVF in bulk or by the 250g box, I pack it in flakes for ageing, and give this treatment to the entire smoking batch. Sealing it after it's dried lets the moisture even out throughout the cut pieces of cubes and lets it burn more evenly. It's a lot fo prep work, though, so I tend to do a tin's worth at a time so it's readily available. I'm experimentign with giving St. James the same treatment. 

Good review. Keep up the good work. I might jump in with a few reviews of myself, soon.

physicsyakuza: I'd love to hear your take on it

AleWatcher: Do you have a blog?  Or post your reviews somewhere else too?

physicsyakuza: Nope, just reddit.

somedumbjerk: FVF takes a few bowls in a row to really develop. Also don't dry it too much. Moisture transfers flavor. That being said DGT has been pretty successful for me. I also have a pipe dedicated to it and over three pounds aging in the cellar.  Fold and stuff with just a little twist to break it apart some is my favorite way to smoke it.

DaveInPhilly: Intriguing. Was this review based on your first bowl or first full tin? I'd also be interested to know how long you have been smoking and what you typically smoke? This is a perfect example of just how incredibly subjective taste is. I have never found FVF to be grassy or hay-like, nor citrus-y. I can kind of see butterscotch, but the cookie-like sweetness has me scratching my head. Its always fascinated my how different people can smoke the exact same tobacco and come up with such completely different experiences. 

FWIW my regular rotation is FVF, Blackwoods Flake and HoTW.

I also wanted echo SDJ, do not overly dry your FVF. In the past I would say that it comes at the perfect moisture level right out of the tin, but the recent tins I have opened have actually been a bit wet for my tastes. Lastly, FVF doesn't need 5 years, sugar crystals will start to form after about 8mos - 1yr and that's when its pure magic.

physicsyakuza: Not my first bowl by any means, but definitely the first where I was really paying attention. I've been smoking for 5 ish years, but only hardcore for about 2 or 3. Thanks for the advice though! I'll definitely keep that in mind for the next bowl.

DaveInPhilly: Do you mostly smoke VA flakes?
--
physicsyakuza: I enjoy them, but I have no set rotation.

====================================
AlexanderpTheGrape: I could never quite get the hang of it, but I always suspected that was my fault.

I never age my tobacco, I tend to just by a tin and smoke it. It always seems like a fun idea but then I have to rub out a whole tin of something, put it in a mason jar and wait six months, it just doesn't seem worth it.

So I end up rubbing out some FVF, waiting like 30 minutes and spending the next day with my tongue feeling like I scarfed boiling pizza cheese.

RoydnJr: I bought my first tin from my local tobacconist, and i think it had a little bit of age on it. I loved it right from the charring light. After that first bowl, i went online and bought a ton of the stuff. I does take a little more care than most blends, but I have always considered my weekly smoke of the stuff to be the highlight of my week.

====================================
itsbaker: I was gifted a small sample of FVF in my first few months smoking and I didn't really have the palate yet to enjoy it. I bought about 8 oz of it this past Feb and have it sitting in jars aging. I'm not going to crack the first one until it has at least a year on it.

Thanks for your review. Its been nice to read each of them.
