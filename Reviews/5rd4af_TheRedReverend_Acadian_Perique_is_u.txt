Acadian Perique is underrated [mini- review]
By: TheRedReverend
---
This has lately become my favorite all-day smoke, since it contains some perique (less than you'd expect) as well as Virginia, Cavendish, Dark fired Kentucky, and some orientals. This blend is really well balanced, and you can tell that throughout the bowl there's a nice medly of flavor profiles: pepper, plum, grass, hay, musty earth-like qualities. I'm so thankful this doesn't have a casing because it showcases just how important blending is in creating a masterpiece. Each ingredient takes it turn in the chorus, and just when you count one ingredient out, there it is to shine.

This blend won't overpower you, and lately with the snow, I've been enjoying it while shoveling. It's been really pleasant, and I'v been really impressed by the mustache note that I get after. This is a pretty tolerable blend, although some may find it a bit cigarette-like at times. I personally don't think so, but there it is. 

Rating: 4/5 - Very happy with this blend, but it could be better. Give it a try though!

By the way, I do these every now and again, but does anyone get any use out of them? I hope so, but I'm not convinced they're useful for this sub. I'm not going to give you a million pages of tasting notes, but I like to talk about what I notice in blends. I've been smoking pipes for a few years now, and my flavor profile shifts and I delight in discovering new blends. Anyway, if you want this to continue, or you like more reviews like the ones I do, let me know by PM or comment. Thanks! As always, I am indebted to this sub.

jb270: I always chuckle at the mention of a moustache note. And I think these informal mini reviews are great. I think sometimes with full length reviews people get so caught up with listing as many notes as possibly they forget to say how the blend made them feel or what they thought of it. Mini reviews are also easily digestible.

TheRedReverend: I do it for the mustache note while at work at least 30% of the time.

evranch: I came to this post to comment about the moustache note, but was beaten to it. I also enjoy a good moustache note, though if I smoke late in the evening I sometimes find it hard to go to sleep, as my moustache smells too good against the pillow
--
TheRedReverend: Yeah. I actually like it before I go to work so I can experience it while in the office.

wayward_midland: Forgive my naivete, but JB and/or u/TheRedReverend, the mustache note must mean what lingers well after you've put the pipe down?
--
jb270: I believe you are thinking of a room note, the scent that lingers around after you smoke. The moustache note is the scent that lingers in your beard or moustache. You occasionally get whiffs of it throughout the day. 
--
wayward_midland: Ah yes. That's what I thought. It's a much nicer way of putting it. And coincidentally the part of pipe and cigar smoking that my wife likes best.

PeskyPrussian: In my opinion, reviews are always interesting and welcome. To clarify, you're talking about the MacBaren blend correct?
--
TheRedReverend: Yes

givemeyours0ul: I like reading reviews. Frequently it inspires me to dig into stuff I haven't smoked in months. For example, I am about to load some of the blend in question into my POTY. It was the first thing I smoked when I started getting back into pipes a while ago, and I didn't like it at that time, but my pipes were all soured by disuse. Interested to see what I think now.
--
TheRedReverend: Give it a go. It's worth your time. 
--
givemeyours0ul: Digging it so far.  
Edit: Liked it quite a bit. Got some dark fruit, some bready-ness. It was fascinatingly astringent. My mouth felt dry in an interesting (not unpleasant) way. Definitely glad I hung onto this until I was firmly back in the hobby, it's very complex.
--
TheRedReverend: Glad I could provide an impetus to give it a try!

misterzipp0: Mini reviews (and *any* reviews) are great, keep em coming!
