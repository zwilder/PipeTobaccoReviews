[Tobacco Review] Sam Gawith: Black XX
By: renholder
---
**Blend Name:** Black XX

**Description on Tin:** Same twisted shapes but MUCH Darker tobaccos than the Brown No.4. Stoving actually makes a richer and slightly milder smoke by heating the sugars and increasing the natural oils.

**Tin Aroma:** Not very strong, kind of musty.

**Taste:** This blend produces quite a peppery taste and can get spicy when lighting up or really puffing on it. Beneath the pepper are some beef kind of meat flavors but I want to mention that it doesn't taste like steak. It is more of a savory meaty feeling than just a straight forward taste. The overall flavoring was medium, it isn't as strong as Brown ropes that I've had but it still had a healthy nic hit.


**Smokability:** I cut this up into chopped pieces as well as thin ribbons. This gave me the smoothest smoke and I needed to dry it out just a little bit. It feels a little oily to the touch but it will dry out quickly so keep and eye on it. No tongue bite and a fairly smooth smoke.

**Room Note:** Couldn't get any info on this. Sorry.

**Thoughts:** I have had a fascination with ropes for a while and ordered a brown and black rope so that I would have something to compare. I cut them both the same way and I found the black to be more approachable but the brown had more flavor.

**Recommend to:** Virginia and burly fans will find flavors they enjoy and I think it is a unique enough kind of tobacco that everyone should try some rope and some point.

**Summary:** Savory pepper steak with a fairly smooth smoke. Does well with age.

**My Background:** Iâ€™m a fan of the English and straight Virginia styles, with an appreciation for well placed burleys. I enjoy more complex or stouter blends, and shy away from one sided aromatics.

I really enjoy reviewing tobacco, and would love to hear back about what I can improve on and what you like about them. Thanks for reading!

====================================
rubanbleu: I never cared for the Black XX rope that much, it was just too much of the "savory pepper" taste you describe without being much else for me.  I think the Brown no. 4 rope is beautiful because it has such a diverse profile of taste and aroma.  I take a whiff from the bulk jar of it every once in a while to just have a simple joy.
--
renholder: I agreem, I much prefer Brown Irish X over this one.

====================================
Jaxx2112: I'm still waiting on you to smoke the rope like a cigar.
--
BarkingLeopard: I think you'd have to figure out a way to create some air holes through the rope, it's pretty dense.
--
Jaxx2112: In one of the podcasts, one of the smaller pieces of rope Renholder had had a decent draw.  Just reminding him of it.
--
BarkingLeopard: Ahh, okay, I'm a good 5 or 6 podcasts behind.

====================================
BarkingLeopard: Renholder was kind enough to send me a sample of this in a trade.  I smoked a bowl of it and didn't hate the smoke, but to be honest I didn't get a whole lot of flavor.  I was very happy to try it, and will consider buying another ounce or two, but for as dark as it was I just didn't get much flavor out of it, so I'll probably try the Brown rope before I try this again.
--
renholder: Yeah, the flavor was a bit lacking especially for how highly regarded this is as a strong smoke. The brown rope won't leave you disappointed! I would've sent you some if I had more than a couple crumbs, maybe on my next order!
--
BarkingLeopard: I honestly didn't feel the N on that smoke, and I had it on an empty stomach.  The tobacco was a bit hard to get lit; my pipe consisted of cutting a plug of rope into slices, then unrolling it and picking it apart into into individual strands the thickness of a single leaf and maybe 1/4"-1/2" long, by <1/4" wide.  I put all that in a bowl, covered it, and let it sit for 30-40 minutes with the idea that it would dry out a little.  Preparing the tobacco was actually a lot of fun, and I want to get rope tobacco in the future just for the fun of prepping it.
