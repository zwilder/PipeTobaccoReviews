Review # 69

**Blend Name:** RO Fire Storm
 
**Description on Tin:** From Russ on P&C:
I’ve been blending pipe tobacco for nearly forty years, but ten years ago is when things really took off. I had made some blends for our brick & mortar store that did well, so we put them up for sale on P&C, and that was the beginning of Hearth & Home. Recently I was asked to make a new series that would let me stretch my wings, as it were, trying to think outside the box, and to use tobaccos and techniques that were different than anything I had done previously. I welcomed this challenge. The powers-that-be, here at P&C wanted me to put my name on these blends, and here’s the first entry in the RO Series – Fire Storm.
While most of the RO Series will be small-batch, limited editions, Fire Storm will be continuously available. I took the Virginias I used in my best-known Virginia-based blend, Anniversary Kake, and amped up the Perique content. Then I added a splash of some very nice dark-fired leaf. Fire Storm starts out, as does Anniversary Kake, quite sweet, but the spice shows up shortly thereafter and builds gradually through the end, with a peppery finish. If you like bold Virginia/Perique blends, give it a try and you’ll understand the reason for its name.

**Leaf:** Standard mottled brown ribbon. Very springy. 
 
**Tin Aroma:** Piney, raisin bran, something sharp like vinegar or even ammonia, vanilla extract

**Taste:** Just like Anniversary Kake with just a touch more Perique. So, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V…

Okay, okay, that would be unsporting of me. Let me load up a bowl and we can do this properly.

Dry hay and a light nuttiness. Pepper comes quick – hot, mustardy, fruity. Very austere – I am expecting the kind of sweetness I associate with Anni Kake and the other red Virginia ribbons, but it is just a teasing edge there. Leather, like you would find in a cigar. That is unexpected as well. The VA has its say for long stretches, weaving in and out of the black pepper backdrop. Barley, hmm, something fermented about it. I suppose this is what Red VA has *always* tasted like, but my more aged palate and vocabulary do a better job explicating the raw sensations. About halfway through, becomes more like I expected, a bit sweeter, that characteristic red wine vinegar comes. Twining together with the Perique-Dark Fired the flavor finally comes on full bore, hot, sweet, and tangy. Which I chase until even my dottle has disappeared.

**Nicotine:** 3 or 4, really depending on the bowl you pack.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** Quite easy with the caveat that the stuff is rather springy which will resist tight packing and with puff up like a microwaved marshmallow when you light it. You might want to overpack this a touch or go with a method like Frank which guarantees a dense core.
 
**Room Note:** I am smoking outside for both pleasant months here, but I get a vague cigarettey whiff off my clothes.

**Thoughts:** I prefer Anniversary Kake. Sorry Russ, I do like your work on the whole, but this was just a touch too far. I am sure you spent months or years developing Anniversary Kake to the point that it was perfectly balanced. And then you make this special version of it which throws the balance way off. It is not that I mind the extra heat, as a proud son of Texas I was taught to enjoy such before I left my crib, but that the additional Perique, small amount that it may be, displaces some of the Virginia in the mixture. This alteration tones down the sweet-vinegar combo that was keystone to the original’s brilliance. Upon longer thought I think this stuff is actually more akin to Bayou Morning, minus the telling C&D burley and OJK sour-funk. It doesn’t pack the same Nicotine punch, but it is very much Perique forward.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Anniversary Kake, Bayou Morning, AJ’s Vaper
 
**Summary:** Anniversary Kake Redux: Red Virginia dominated VaPer, made extra spicy and extra crispy.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
boomer56: Another great review, /u/antiwittgenstein! I always enjoy your work.

(you actually saw Blues Brothers 2000?!?)
--
antiwittgenstein: Well I am bending the rules here - I've only seen about 5 minutes of it - but enough to hate it forever.
--
====================================
PeskyPrussian: Awesome review!  I count firestorm among my absolute favorites at the moment, probably because I absolutely love Perique.  I was going to compare some of your tasting notes with my own when I realized that, despite the fact that I've been smoking this blend for a while, I've never actually written anything down.  I guess I know what I'll be doing tonight then...
--
antiwittgenstein: It would be great to see another opinion on this, I am looking forward to your post.
--
====================================
Dadgy: I'm pretty much in line with your thoughts, and I'm a professed Anni Kake enthusiast. Fire Storm may have the same base, but it's just not what I was expecting. I finished the tin, but I won't have this on my list again.
--
====================================
Kal-ElofKrypton: Come back to it in 4 months and try again. I did that and it had a completely different flavor profile. 
--
antiwittgenstein: This was from the box pass, which from the date had about 2 years of age on it which makes me think it had settled out. What kind of flavor did you get before and after?
--
Kal-ElofKrypton: Right out of the tin, it was all sweet. 4 months later, more balanced with the perique.
--
antiwittgenstein: Interesting, so really I should try this *fresh* as opposed to its current as aged condition - I would have preferred a sweeter smoke actually as the Perique dominated these bowls more than is my liking.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Had the tin been opened when you got it or did you break the seal?


--
antiwittgenstein: It was in a sample baggie - I don't know what condition it was pre-bagging though.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Ok.  That explains why you didn't make any comment on the tin aroma when bursting the seal.  ;-)
