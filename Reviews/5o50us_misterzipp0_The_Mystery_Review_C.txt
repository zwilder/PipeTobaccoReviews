The Mystery Review Contest has the green light! Signup coming soon!

A few weeks ago I asked the sub if there was any interest in receiving some unlabeled tobaccos and reviewing/guessing the blend.  Overall the feedback was positive and I got the go ahead so let's do it!

First off, this is *NOT* the signup thread! Do not PM me with any info as that's coming later, I just want to let everyone know that this contest exists.

Second, at this time we are only opening this up to US residents.  Since this is just a trial run I want to keep it simple and looking into customs laws and filling out forms and foreign taxes is a bit over my head at the moment.  

Third, this needs at least 15 people to make this worthwhile and I'm going to cap it at 20 for this trial round.

Regarding the time frame of this:

Sign ups will be open for 8 days staring Jan 21 and ending Jan 28 at midnight central.  I want to keep the interest up and not drag this thing out forever.  If you've got friends that want to participate in this that aren't on Reddit point them this way so they can get familiar with everything.

The goal is to have everyone signed up by the 28th so I can have the tobacco in my hands and out to you by Feb 10.  We will open up a new thread for the reviews starting March 10.  This gives you ~3 weeks to have time to smoke and familiarize yourself with the blend and get your guess in.

In order to keep it fair you can PM me your guess anytime between when you receive the blend and March 10 but your guess only counts if you post up a review in the thread.  The contest portion of the review thread will only count from March 10 to March 12 at midnight central.  If you're not interested in the contest or you don't care you can still post in the thread anytime after that.  If there are multiple people that guess it I will use a random number generator to pick the winner.

Payment: 

I'm only accepting PayPal F&F to keep this easier to track so now is the heads up to get signed up and familiar with PP on your end.  I think someone mentioned that they don't do credit/debit cards, if that is the case please get in touch with me and I will get something worked out. I strongly urge everyone to use PP so there is streamlined communication on the whole thing.  The cost to enter is $10 and that covers the samples,packaging, and first class shipping to your address.

The actual contest:

You will receive two separate samples of pipe tobacco weighing between half an oz and one oz each.  One of these blends will contain Latakia, one of them won't.  Each ziplock will be labeled as such and have a Blend 1 or Blend 2 on it.

The goal is to analyze the sample (preferably by smoking) and make a guess on which blend it is and also post a review of the blend.  We are not looking for some grand post on "notes of 3 day old rye bread" but rather a can you identify the components comment. You're free to write whatever you like.  The goal of this is to help folks identify flavors in a blend and to translate that to written word and foster community participation.  The overall goal is also just to have fun with it.  Tobacco can behave in weird ways, what you thought was perique could be dark fired, what you taste as orange could be apple to someone else so let's have some fun and challenge your tasters!

Post up your questions here if you made it this far!  *Remember this is not the signup thread*

crimsonrat: Would you like mojo or gentleman caller? Perhaps some crooner? I'll mix it in some tambolaka for you. 
--
summerkc: I'd totally try that. I'll review this "Venison Old Fashioned"

Occams-shaving-cream: That is one of sentences where I wonder if you just missed a comma, or it was a *truly* odd flavor.
--
scriptonic: There, I fixed the punctuation. 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Lol :)

Pipezilla: If I get tongued by a deer, I'd be happy

Pipezilla: Is this the signup thread?

====================================
dog_in_the_vent: This looks like fun!  Can't wait to read some of these reviews and see the results.

I'd participate but I don't know nearly enough about tobacco to say this is a "perique" or this is a "latakia".
--
linkbylink: Same. I'm doing good just to remember which end the tobacco goes in, now if I can just get the damn filter lit...
--
dog_in_the_vent: You gotta light the filter, THEN put it into the pipe.
--
====================================
jonknight: Great to see all you chaps the other side of the pond having so much fun. 
--
scriptonic: Get your own club. I think we made it pretty clear in 1775 this is a No brits allowed club
--
V1ld0r_: The things, bulk tobacco in Europe is virtually non-existing and it sucks to have someone buy a couple of tins, repack and ship... But maybe we could do it? No? 
--
DankPipes: Will there be patches for this club?  I only consider clubs with patches.
