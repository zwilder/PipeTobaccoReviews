REVIEW - McClelland 40th Anniversary
By: IndyPiper
---
**Tin Description** - Superb North Carolina red Virginiaworthy of a very special occasion. Let's celebrate with this rich, sweet, mellow tobacco in a classic Virginia flake, the kind of beautiful flake readily available in 1977 but a rare treasure in 2017, with great cellaring potential.  Cheers!  
  

**Tin Note** - The famous McClelland Ketchup smell is here. It is not appalling. This was my first experience with it and I was worried the smell would turn me off, but it doesn't.  Underneath I can get some hits of the sweetness of the Virginia.  
  
**Moisture Content** - Perfect out of the tin. No need to dry.  
  
**Visual Note** - Beautiful flake with a dark red color and bright spots throughout.  
  
**Smoke** - Wonderful flavor of sweet hay and grass. Suttle notes of dried fruit. Flavor was very consistent through out.  Sweet hay flavor never left.  Retro hale was pleasent and amplified the sweet hay.  It is a mild smoke and the room not is pleasent.  
  
**TL:DR** - Great mild, sweet smoke with suttle flavors of dark fruit through out. This is a limited edition tobacco so buy a few tins now.  One to smoke and a few others to age.

ThatGuyGaren: Would you mind posting a picture of the flakes? I've never seen it and pictures of good tobacco are always pleasant to look at.

FullFrontalNoodly: IMO the ketchup note on this one is extremely mild.  Even on McClelland blends where the ketchup note is strong it dissipates while your tobacco is drying.  Never really understood why so many people make such a big deal about this.


--
IndyPiper: Honestly, before I got this blend I was a little scared because I didn't know what to compare it to except a bottle of ketchup.  It isn't bad at all and I was worried for nothing.
--
antiwittgenstein: I always think of it as more of a Worcestershire sauce smell. Which I love. And like it when the smells comes through on the taste, like in Blackwoods.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Agreed.  I really don't think it smells much like ketchup at all aside from the vinegar note.

====================================
damadfaceinvasion: I’ve been smoking this blend nonstop for the past few weeks. It’s not as deep, flavorful or complex as I thought it would be, nor is it as complex as a Gawith flake. I taste a bright citrusy flavor, a deeper grassy hay note, and a “dry” aftertaste(I mean this in a good way, like a whiskey or a good wine) and not much else. Granted I haven’t aged it but I’ve smoked it out of multiple pipes including a dedicated one. All that being said it’s very good at what it does. It burns easily and evenly, it doesn’t bite and it delivers its flavor consistently. It’s a great all day winter blend for that reason. The nicotine content is very mild. I’ve smoked bowls of this stuff on an empty stomach and not felt any ill effects. It’s a great all day Virginia flake. Kind of like a higher quality ORlick golden sliced but with more of a backbone and less bite and no perique. It’s not something that knocked my socks off or blew my mind, but I’ll continue to smoke this stuff regularly. I like it a lot.

antiwittgenstein: Any other flakes you care to compare this one to?
--
IndyPiper: I don’t have a ton of experience with full Virginia’s. The only other one I have had was C&D Yorktown and it’s been a while.
