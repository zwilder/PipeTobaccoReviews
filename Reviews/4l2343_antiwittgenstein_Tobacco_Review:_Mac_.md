Tobacco Review: Mac Baren Burley London Blend
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 70

**Blend Name:** Mac Baren Burley London Blend
 
**Description on Tin:** A very distinct tobacco. Made from white Burley, well matured in wooden casks and pressed in broken flake form. A real smoking pleasure.

**Leaf:** Generic brown ribbon
 
**Tin Aroma:** Classic raisin bran.

**Taste:** Nutty and plain. A hint of pepper that comes on strong on first light and then settles in, much like a cigar. Fairly inoffensive, but nothing really to talk about. This looks like it is heading for one-plus-ville. A little nutty, whiffs of cigar. A Virginia-esque sweetness appears once in awhile making this taste like a slightly higher rent Carter Hall. 

But wait.

Halfway through the bowl there is a sudden shift. Elegant and rich flavors fill my mouth. Cigar like, with leather, and cream, and a deeper, almost honey like sweetness, which is still just to the sweet side of dry. Woodsy, with a soft, almost imperceptible smokiness to it, with a bit of meat char. Something also topping like in here, reminds me of Captain Black Royal. Now it smells just like plain burning burley, but there are snatches of vanllia pudding here.

**Nicotine:** About 4, but on this last bowl I had 2 very distinct Nic-hiccups.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Well I let this sample desiccate like it was a Dead Sea Scroll, but despite it burning alarmingly hot there was not bite and no burley mouth.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but I would guess not great.

**Thoughts:** At first I was ready to chalk this one up for a fine old codger’s stuff, puff, and forget mixture, but when I first hit that glorious middle I was transfixed. I had to sit down and just enjoy my smoke, chasing the bowl down to the dottle. It was a strange experience, like seeing the pale flicker of a light and then 20,000 lumens of excited-xenon power blasting away the darkness. 

This blend starts filling in a gap in the burley progression I have developed. So far I have had a couple of OTC standards – Prince Albert and Carter Hall – which are good tobaccos, but mild in every sense. And then the C&D burleys – OJK, Big N Burley, and my favorite thus far, Haunted Bookshop – which are full flavored and even fuller powered. Burley London Blend puts another rung in that ladder right in between, with a moderate nicotine level and really solid, but not overwhelming flavors. If Prince Albert ran a Haunted Bookshop, it would likely taste just like this.
Oh man. When I looked up to find the Tin Description I found out this was discontinued. Sorry folks. Grab it if you can find it I guess.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Prince Albert, Erin Go Brah (RIP), Haunted Bookshop
 
**Summary:** A stouter Prince Albert or a friendly Haunted Bookshop middle of the road Burley will a show stopping finish.

**My Background:** **My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the Major League Baseball Rule Book):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Stealing 1st base on a dropped 3rd strike)

(++++) Great (The now outmoded contested runner-catcher slugfest rules)

(+++) Very good (The ground rule triple)

(++) Good (All fielders except the catcher are positioned within fair territory)

(+) I think like it (No spitballs)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Ground Rule Double)

(-) I think I dislike this (Having to pitch in an intentional walk)

(--)This is not for me (You can’t steal 1st base from 2nd)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Infinite time outs called by the batter)

(----)This is suffering (What counts as a balk anyway?))

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (The designated hitter)
====================================
HighlyAmatuerExpert: Ground rule triple?

antiwittgenstein: If a fielder throws their glove at the ball to stop it, and it makes contact with the ball, the hitter and all base runners are awarded 3 bases. It doesn't really happen often [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/235alh/ground_rule_triple_or_really_three_base_award/)

HighlyAmatuerExpert: Interesting

====================================
4noggins: I certainly hope no one falls in love with this blend since it has been discontinued for about two years now.

antiwittgenstein: Yeah I felt bad about posting the review of this, but since I learned right as I was putting it up I figured I might as well do so for posterity. Over on tobaccoreviews some of the folks said it was very close to Mac Baren Symphony, so I will give that a go and see how close they really are.
