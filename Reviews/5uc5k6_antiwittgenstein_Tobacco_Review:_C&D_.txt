Tobacco Review: C&D Shandygaff
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 84

**Blend Name:** C&D Shandygaff
 
**Description on Tin:** An unusual old Atlas Blending mixture C&D acquired the rights to, Shandygaff combines Burley, Turkish, and Perique leaf to produce a smoke often described as carrying flavors of ginger and salty sea air.

**Leaf:** So anonymously boring it is interesting. Dry enough that leaving it out to rest might make it more wet.
 
**Age when smoked:** About 9 months.

**Tin Aroma:** Bready. Rum raisins. Earthy.

**Taste:** Peppery and earthy. Like cigars? This might be up your alley. Something along the Diesel or Punch Bareknuckle line. Densely earthy and rich. Creamy and oily at once. Bready of course. Maybe hazelnuts. The pepper unfolds in classic perique flavors, sweet and fruity, with a bit of brightness. Just saying ‘fruity’ isn’t my style, let’s say raspberries then. Dizzing. That isn’t a flavor, but it is a central part of the Shandygaff experience. Plan an intermission for this one, or save this one for post-Thanksgiving level gorging.

Back at it. The same flavors come through fairly consistently, peppery, fruity, earthy. A nice butteriness to it.

**Nicotine:** 6, fairly stout, similar to the other C&D burley blends

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Easy as Prince Albert. However, the first few times I had this, with maybe 4-6 months on it, it gave me world class burley mouth. Plan ahead on this one.
 
**Room Note:** Toasty

**Thoughts:** After doing my taxes I wanted to have a stout sit-me-down smoke. I can say this did the job. 

So after having four of the C&D burley blends I can sort of place them like this:

Old Joe Krantz – funky, musty, sourdough bread

Big N Burley – powerful straightforward burley flavor

Haunted Bookshop – Elegant, complex, the corners of the previous two smoothed down

Shandygaff – peppery and traditional burley
So it is good stuff, but should be part of a complete breakfast, er, burley cellar. 

After action report. I put the bowl down 20-30 minutes ago and my head is still swimming. I had the nicotine hiccups. And feel pretty green. Smoke responsibly.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Haunted Bookshop, Big N Burley, Prince Albert
 
**Summary:** A very cigar like peppery-fruity burley blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight, and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the world of taxes ):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (The benefit of being in the middle)

(++++) Great (Beer tax, I mean when you tax a sip/bottle for going on a beer run.)

(+++) Very good (Cannabis taxes)

(++) Good (Capital gains taxes)

(+) I think like it (State income taxes)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Sales tax)

(-) I think I dislike this (Federal income taxes)

(--)This is not for me (Inheritance tax)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (VAT tax)

(----)This is suffering (Corporate taxes)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Property taxes)

====================================
mgvsquared: Well the nicotine being high is a given. This is one of Matches big 3. 
--
gestalt162: HB, Shandygaff, what's the third?
--
mgvsquared: Big N Burley!
--
====================================
wyrmis: Haunted Bookshop is one of my main blends (and I smoke a variety of burley blends and perique blends). If you were to take Haunted Bookshop as a starting point, would this be an insta-yes, or is it different enough (it seems fairly different based on your review) that you can't quite handle it as such?
--
antiwittgenstein: Haunted bookshop is my favorite burley. Shandygaff isn't quite up to that level - it doesn't have the polish and richness to it that HB has. Should you try Shandygaff? Well, are on you on the journey? I mean, my smoking style means continually trying new blends, rarely smoking something after I have reviewed it. If you are looking for every good blend out there, yes, grab an ounce this Sunday, and then wait until the NFL starts back up to test it out. If you are a pound or nothing guy, looking for a committed serious relationship, well while this is good, I think you would agree with me that HB is much better.

If you want, PM and I can kick a couple of bowls your way.

wyrmis: I love that way of putting it, being "on the journey". I guess for me, I have about 10 or so "anchors" (stuff like Haunted Bookshop, Cairo, MM965, Prince Albert, a couple of local B&M blends) that I return to time and time again, but I try to work in about one new tobacco at least once a fortnight, sometimes more often, and while I'm not one who has to be assured I will like a tobacco before I try it, I find myself gravitating more and more to the "pound at a time" type of guy (including having gotten pound-weight bulk of blends I've never tried before, which is risky, but how I discovered C&D's Constellation, which I adore). I'll send you a PM.

====================================
professor_throway: Thanks for the review this has been on my try list for a while. Maybe I will pick up a few oz and hold onto it until the summer.

====================================
anxst: Shandygaff is my favorite Burley blend. The orientals in it bring on bits of gingery salt flavors that just bring to mind time at the beach. Like most C&D blends it does tend to need a little age on it when it first arrives, so a touch of planning definitely helps. One I'll always have in my cellar, though.
