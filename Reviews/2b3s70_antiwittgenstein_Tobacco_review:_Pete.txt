Tobacco review: Peter Stokkebye English Luxury

Review #1

For for my first review I chose something that was one of the very first pipe tobacco's I smoked and that I frequently find myself recommending to others.
Edit: Even though it is not common practice here, I wanted to add a rating, according to my own 11 point (that's right baby, 11!) point scale.


**Blend Name:** Peter Stokkebye English Luxury

**Description on Tin:** A characteristic English mixture. A mixture developed from mellow Georgian Virginias, Black Cavendish, Mexican Burleys and Cyprus Latakia â€“ a classic. Tobacco cut: Medium Cavendish and loose cut. Tobacco Flavor/Aroma: Non-aromatic, with a range from mild to medium strength.

**Leaf:** A mixture of fine cut yellow and black leaves.

**Tin Aroma:** Lapsang Souchong tea - wood smoke, hint of rasiny-vanilla sweetness

**Taste:** This is a blantanly virginia forward English blend, and you notice this from the first light. It is tangy, edging to outright lemony. The latakia is there and does not hide, giving a pleasant wood smoke taste with every puff. The cavendish is also evident, with a subtle sweetness that rounds out the tanginess of the virginia. On ocassion I pull a mouthful with a decidedly vanilla flavor, which I suspect comes from the cavendish.

As you get deeper into the bowl the virginia flavor progresses (even in a shallower pot shaped pipe), deepening, getting richer, but the sweetness and the smoke do not diminish in themselves.

**Smokability:** English Luxury feels slightly damp in the jar, but I find it lights and smokes like a champ even without letting it rest more than the few minutes its takes me to scoop it into the bowl. The smoke is on the lighter side, and if I were to make one complaint, it would be on this point. However, as the bowl progresses the smoke does thicken up just a bit. I am able to smoke this to a white clump of ash with one or two relights as long as I am paying attention to my cadence and tamp cycle.

**Room Note:** Hard for me to catch, but seemed sweet with a mild wood smoke aroma.

**Thoughts:** This is often recommended as a entry into the world of latakia and was indeed my own. I have bought several other Englishes since, so it was good enough to hook me. How does it stack up? It is not a Dunhill style bruiser, either in taste or the Nicotine department; it does not compete on complexity either, but is still satisfying, and worth keeping on hand considering its extreme affordability.

**Summary:** Quite a tasty, if straight-shooting virginia lover's English, which never shies from the match.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, McClleland's Blackwoods, and Dunhill 965.

Edit:

**Rating:** ++

====================================
somewherein72: This sounds really similar to a blend I bought last week, [Newminster English Luxxus](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/5336/newminster-no-17-english-luxus). Except, Luxxus has a small bit of perique in it.I've not been particularly crazy about it, maybe because of the perique. It comes across a little acrid in the few bowls I've smoked of it so far. 

Thanks for the review, I've been wondering how this was.

antiwittgenstein: I was thinking of trying the Luxxus myself. So thanks to you as well for the heads up.

====================================
abcdthc: If "Virginia" is the type of tobacco, and Coarse is the cut, what does "English Style" mean?
--
pwny_: Latakia. English = latakia. This blend is basically a mix of English/VA.
--
antiwittgenstein: I am not the most learned of pipe smokers but I believe that an English tobacco originally meant any tobacco made in England - where the predominance of blends featured latakia. So 'English Style' or even just 'English' (no matter its place of blending) is often applied to any kind of blend that features latakia. 

Please, my pipe elders, correct me if I misspoke.
--
Darwin7848: This is in indeed correct.  Originally an "English" blend referred to any blend free of adulterants as prescribed by national standards established in the UK.  The actual amount of Latakia, or any other tobacco, is not standardized and can vary greatly.
