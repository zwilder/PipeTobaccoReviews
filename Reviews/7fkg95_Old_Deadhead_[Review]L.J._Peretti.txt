**Name:** L.J. Peretti D-9507

**Type:** English/Oriental

**Leaf:** Virginia, Perique, Oriental/Turkish

**Blender’s Description:** Our most unusual English-type tobacco flavored with rich, cured Virginia, blended with fine Dubeck Turkish. You will find it mild and smooth.

**Old Deadhead’s Opinion:** This is the third of the four tobaccos I am reviewing from L.J. Peretti’s “Hybrid Sampler”. I’ve smoked this out of a number of pipes, and haven’t really noticed a significant difference out of any of them. 

The tin note is somewhat sweet, but with the telltale sour, slightly fermented Cavendish and Perique, a smell that I love. Unfortunately, it doesn’t translate into the taste as much as I’d like, but we’ll get to that. A [mostly dark blend with some traces of brown and tan](https://imgur.com/aWYQ5tz), this is another fairly rough cut. Even with a decent amount of drying, this one seemed to need more relights than average. 

The initial charring light tastes of Virginias, with just a hint of spice. One thing that becomes apparent very quickly is an almost dry taste, not smoky, but dark and not particularly sweet. There’s hints of sour here and there, a little spice but, honestly, not much else. While the aroma says Perique, there’s none of the nice pepper tartness. I assume there’s actually very little Perique in the mix. As we get down to halfway, not much changes, although the sour note does pick up a notch. The bowl finishes out pretty much the same. As far as nicotine level, this one really didn’t have a particularly noticeable amount. 

**Summary:** Unfortunately, I’m going to have to say this one disappointed me. I love Perique and Orientals, but somehow in this blend, the sum of the parts didn’t equal the whole I was hoping for. Perhaps there's some subtleties in there that are lost on me but I’m wondering if some age wouldn’t benefit this one greatly. I have a bit over half of the one ounce sample left and  plan on sticking it on the bottom shelf and revisiting it some day far in the future when I inadvertently stumble across it trying to remember what’s in all the little jars that end up tucked away. Hopefully time will marry the flavors in a way that simple mixing couldn’t accomplish. 

**2.5/5**

Scale:

5/5: This is Heaven, man!!

4/5: This deserves to be in my regular rotation

3/5: I'd probably revisit this at some point

2/5: Well, that was...interesting

1/5: WTF did I just smoke?

====================================
antiwittgenstein: This must be Dubeck and Perreti night in the sub as both you and /u/HandsomeRalphy chose to review Dubeck LJP burley blends. Thanks for warning us off of one that underperforms.

Old_Deadhead: I can't find many references to Dubeck (also Dubek and Dubec) outside of descriptions of it being a varietal type of Basma, making it a Greek tobacco. It should be far more flavorful, as such, but I'm just not getting it. I'm definitely interested in trying the Blend #52, as I love Peretti's Burley. I'll be sure to see if I get that same off, dry note from it, as well.
