[Review] Gawith Hoggarth & Co. - Dark Plug
By: crimblade

**Blend Name:** Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. - Dark Plug

**Description on Tin:** As Dark Flake unscented but, from the cake, the tobacco is cut into bars. A very strong, but very cool smoke is the result of combining in equal proportions only Malawi Dark Fired Leaf and Indian dark air-cured leaf. No additional flavors. You can smell in this tobacco the Smokey flavor of the dark fired leaf derived from its curing process of being hung above smoky fires, and the sweeter, yet still strong 'cigar type' flavor of the dark-air-cured Indian leaf.

**Leaf:** Burley and Virginia. A dark brown bar of compressed leaves. Looks like a delicious brownie. It's less compact than some plugs which means it can fall apart if you're not respectful, makes it a lot easier to cube cut without busting out a saw. 

**Tin Aroma:** Dark and earthy with a lakeland essence. 

**Taste:** On the initial light the lakeland essence is fairly forward. Once you get a solid burn going the lakeland takes a backseat to the tobacco. It occasionally pops it's head out later on but for the most part it plays a very minor role in the smoke. Once the lakeland calms down you get a rich earthy flavor. As the description states it's very akin to the more robust flavor of a cigar. Dark earthy smoke is the main player through out. 

**Smokability:** Like most G&H blends this one is damp. However there is a point in this blend where it can be too dry and the flavor loses some of it's dark flavor. However without any drying it's fireproof. This is a blend that demands careful attention to preparation, which in my opinion only adds to the enjoyment that comes later. Has a Nicotine hit like a grand piano dropped from the 5th floor. 

**Room Note:** Very akin to a cigar, slightly sweeter, no lakeland scents here, if there are they're over whelmed by the sheer power of the dark plug.

**Thoughts:** I became interested in getting the plug due to my enjoyment of Dark Flake Unscented which is simply the flake version of the plug. I'm very glad I did since the plug seems to have a much richer, fuller flavor than the flake. With the flake I didn't have any loss of flavor due to over drying which I attribute to it's toned down flavor when compared to the plug. I've never done a back to back comparison of the two due to my will to continue existing in this dimension. The plug seems to hit a little heavier in the nicotine department than the flake but it's not a big margin of difference. The less you dry it the harder it seems to hit. Smoking Dark plug is an exercise in patience and focus. From the moment you start to prepare the tobacco to the moment you clean out the dottle it pretty much demands your attention. Which can be off putting for some but what it does do is make this tobacco one that you make a conscious decision to shut out the rest of the world for a while when you smoke it. One of the interesting things about the tobacco is that it's very slow to bite, which is nice in that you can smoke it a bit damper than you would expect, however while you gain an enhanced flavor profile you lose the ability to actually light the stuff on fire. It's a blend of balance. Unless you're looking for balance in flavor and nicotine, both of which it goes all in on. The dark smokey flavor of the smoke goes very well with the cooling weather and changing colors of fall. If you do get this, then do yourself a treat and get 4oz.  The plug you'll receive is massive and will not disappoint, you in any aspect of life. One last thought, while you can smoke this in the morning and it does compliment a dark roast very well, you probably shouldn't unless you plan on doing nothing afterwards but quietly dozing the morning, and quite possibly the afternoon, away.

**Recommend to:** If you enjoy Gawith and Hogarths other offerings, particularly the dark flake unscented. Anyone looking for a cigar strength flavor in a pipe tobacco. I do not recommend this to newer smokers, start with the flakes/ropes and work your way up.

**Summary:** Despite it's finicky nature and sometimes unforgiving preparation standards it's one of the most enjoyable smokes you can have.

**Drink Pairings:**  Black Tea, Milk, Water, a good non-alcoholic Cider, and maybe a nice bourbon or scotch but the heavy liquor will dull the taste of the tobacco a bit, not to mention add an anvil followup to the falling piano.

**Final Rating:** 4/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp, Quiet Nights, and Dark Plug.

professor_throway: Fantastic review. 

I think I will give this a pass as I really prefer the scented version of Dark Flake. Gotta have that licorice and tonquin. I can't image the nicotine being stronger than in the flake.  (For anyone that hasn't tried it is makes Irish Flake seem weak. To me it feels just as strong as the G&H ropes and slightly stronger than SG 1792 ). I like strong blends but Dark Flake is strictly a nighttime smoke for me.

crimblade: Thanks! If you enjoy the Lakeland aspect then definitely stick with the Scented, which is a tasty smoke as well. I don't know what it is about the plug that makes it hit that little bit harder than the rest of the GH family but man it's a doozy. Definitely a night time smoke.

Jokers247: What is a good black licorice'esque tobacco? 
--
professor_throway: For a  licorice  aromatic you can't do better than Esoterica Ramsgate or Blackpool. 

G&H liquorice twist is good but very lightly flavored and support strong in nicotine.

Velvet and many other OTC burleys have anise in their topping which gives a licorice not. Mixture 79 has some but it is so muffled up in other flavors it is hard to pull out.

I really like both the G&H brown Flake and Dark Flake scented but the flavor combination is licorice, maple, and tonquin plus sorted Lakeland magic. The licorice and tonquin are stronger than the maple. 


Uhle's blend 255 is supposed to be good with a pretty flavorful licorice topping but I haven't tried it. 

Stokkebye Sambuca is supposed to be as licorice bomb but I haven't tried it yet either.

gregny2002: Nice review.  Noob question: what is Lakeland?
--
crimblade: Lakeland is a traditional english topping. It's generally a floral scent/flavor. It's one of those things that people either enjoy or make unfair comparisons to older grannies. One of the most notable Lakeland blends is Ennerdale which is pretty strong in the topping. It's a good one to get an introduction to lakelands since it leaves no doubt about what is or isn't lakeland. One thing to keep in mind about them is that they're one of those blends you want a dedicated briar for, so if you do try them use a cob, that way if you don't enjoy it you don't ghost a briar for nothing.
