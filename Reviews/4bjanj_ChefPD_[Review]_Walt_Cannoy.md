[Review] Walt Cannoy's Suedeblasted Brandy with Honey Buffalo Horn
By: ChefPD

====================================
ChefPD: Hey y’all. I’m doing this review since Walt asked for honest reviews of his work. I didn’t get to it earlier because of school and work. It won’t be long or terribly detailed, but I’ll try to add in whatever I feel is most important. I’ll blow my load a little early here, and say, I liked it, but it wasn’t for me, and I sold it a couple months and a couple dozen smokes later.

Fit and finish were overall good. The only cosmetic issues that I noticed were the shank adornment and the cant of the bowl. You could see either a little separation from the horn and and the mortise/tenon or you could see the glue seam. This, I think, would have been mended simply by not using horn since it’s translucent. That, or a more careful application. The cant of the bowl was lovely really, but didn’t seem as sinuous as it could have been with the underside of the pipe. Drilling, shaping, and blasting were all 100%. 

Size was an issue. I love a small pipe, and that’s part of what attracted me to this pipe. The small size in conjunction with the small bowl made it just a little too dainty for me. 

I’ll expand a little on the blast. It’s a suedeblast, one of Walt’s trademarks and supposedly nobody else has gotten this technique down or really even close to Walt. That’s why I wanted one for so long. The blast did not disappoint! It was really quite nice both visually and tactically. A little flaking at first, but once the looser flakes came out, it was pretty stable. 

I understand why the price was what it was, but all told, I just wasn’t comfortable having paid what I did for a pipe that I wasn’t really as into as I thought I would be. The work involved certainly makes it worth his asking price, but again, it was a good chunk of cash, so take that as you will. So, I sold it. It was a good pipe, not a bad pipe. It had what was promised of it, but for those couple of reasons, I had to let it go from my collection. Thank you, Walt, for your art. It was nonetheless artfully and masterfully crafted, and a beautiful pipe. Thanks for reading!

SmallDrunkMonkey: Off topic, what camera (and lens if applicable) did you use to do the photos?  The first image appears to have a relatively narrow plane of focus, suggesting a fast lens and low aperture.
--
ChefPD: I used my phone, I have a galaxy s6. It was on auto mode so I didn't choose any of that stuff but there are options to go fully manual.
--
SmallDrunkMonkey: I'm legit impressed, could've fooled me and said it was a DSLR and I would've believed you.
--
first-capri: Reason why I am trying convince my SO away from a DSLR. I think they are unnecessary for most occasions. 
--
SmallDrunkMonkey: For working professionals, it still dominates the photography field but for the average person--would have to agree, only major downside is relatively short battery life so getting more than one is a *must*.

chambreezy: It's like having tobacco on the outside AND inside! Awesome!

====================================
Kofcandre: That texture makes me feel uneasy

carnesy: As a nursing student, I've said that exact same thing many times about this finish.

====================================
csobod: I love that texture. I wonder if a combination of moisture to raise the grain with a etching airbrush would yield something similar.
