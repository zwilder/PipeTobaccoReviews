Tsuge Ryujin (a Brief Review)
By: SMIDSY
---
Hello everyone. Last week, on an impulse, I volunteered to do a review of this interesting blend at the request of /u/OliverWotei . 

Well, here it is:


Moving past the beautiful Tsuge tin art, this blend is worth a try if only to see how rough a cut can be on a functional tobacco blend (perfect ribbon junkies need not apply).


I'll start with the tl;dr: Very smokey, but smooth.



Moisture: Comes a bit damp and has a wide variety of component sizes. I dry mine for 30-40 minutes.


Cut: With a machete. There is every damn cut you can imagine in there. Everything from perfect ribbons to bits of stem to chunks of yellow leaf that are about the quarter the size of my palm. Somehow, through Shinto magic no doubt, it manages to burn just as well as an average ribbon or coarse cut.


Tin note: Smokey creosote. Reminds me a lot of Gaslight but slightly less sharp.


Taste when damp: my notes say "smokey, spicy, chewy."

Taste when dry: The smokiness is a bit less forward and comes out more in the aroma of the smoke. Surprisingly smoother. The "chewiness" has turned more to "creamy".


Nicotine level: This one surprised me after reading a few reviews. Most people say it's a high nicotine creeper. While I can see where they get that from (the rough cut will cause the leaf burning to alternate from low-nic lat to higher-nic VA. But I'll say it's in the higher end of medium. I didn't feel the nicotine blanket tucking me in to sleep with this one like I do with my high-nic blends.


Taste/mouth experience: Very little bite, especially when properly dried. Creosote taste and especially smell. The taste will also fluctuates due to the extremely rough cut. One minute, you're smoking strait Latakia, the next you are smoking a big chunk of VA leaf.




Conclusion: All and all, it's a good blend for the lat lovers that want something a little different. Not one of my favorites, but something I'd like to have in stock for when I want something like Gaslight but don't feel like dealing with the prep or the cut mechanics.

misterzipp0: Great review! Post up more of your favorite blends when you've got time.

SMIDSY: I was considering a "make SMIDSY smoke..." series. But this one reminded me that, in general, I don't like smoking the same blend twice in a row. I'm always in the mood for something different.


But I'm thinking maybe Pembroke for the next one.

TastesLikeBees: Great review! I picked up a tin of this a couple months ago from a cigar shop that had opened fairly recently and had only just started carrying pipe tobacco. They had several of the Tsuge blends, but this one seemed like it held the most appeal for me. 

Looking forward to trying it soon.

SMIDSY: I'm glad you like the review. I'll continue to post them for random requests and for blends I think more people should try.

mememagicisreal_com: Just bought a tin of this because of the reviews saying it had a strong nic kick. A little off topic but what tins are your favorite for a very strong nic kick?
--
SMIDSY: I'm not gonna say it has a weak nic kick. It's not something you can just puff on like a freight train, but it is fully manageable with proper cadence.



Blends I have had that I would consider "high" in nicotine would be Irish Flake, Jack Knife Plug, Triple Play, and Brown Bogey.


On the lower end of the high scale, I'd put Patriot Flake, Bayou Night, and Night Train.




This is also subjective. I have a reasonable tolerance for nicotine. I vape every day and smoke a pipe bowl once a day. To me, something "medium" is something that I can feel but am in no danger at all of being overwhelmed by the nicotine. Something medium high is something that I will be fine with as long as I don't puff really fast. Low/high is something that will absolutely give me a mild/medium nicotine buzz but I can smoke the whole bowl in one sitting. High is having to take a break somewhere through smoking the bowl. Very high is tiny bowls only.
