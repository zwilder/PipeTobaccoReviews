Cult Blood Red Moon review by a noob..

If you've read any of the online positive reviews about Cult Blood Red Moon you have read such claims that depict a joining in spirit of tobaccos such as Burley, Virginia and black cavendish in a union showered by succulent essences of cherry, dark chocolate and vanilla.  Your tempted by the taunt of a smooth gentle aromatic that will enchant the crowds while delivering you your own reward.

Cult followers begin by luring you with the opening of the tin and the tangy sweet tin note of cherries however lurking in the dark corners there is definitely something more.

As the ceremonious fire is touched to the potion immediately the spirits are summoned and remain present surrounding you in an envelope of warmth and peace.  

It's all a lie.  Stay as far away from this product as you can.  Leave it.  While in short supply at this time you will find some in a few places.  Again I implore you... leave it.  I'll gather it up for you.


====================================
GanDuff: Ok, so this was a fun and lighthearted read, but I do have a couple of points to make:

- First and most importantly, the title: If you're going to say it's a review, then please, actually review it. Otherwise, use a different title, something that would reflect what's to come in the actual post. I would recommend editing the post by adding in an actual review section. This way the title is not misleading.

- Please work on your punctuation, or lack thereof in some instances. At times, it can throw the reader off.

That's it, I hope that was helpful. If you do end up putting in a review section, I look forward to reading it :)

Cheers

GanDuff: I hate you. You made me question myself, and I ended up changing it.

boomermax: it is a nice treat if you are looking for an aromatic with taste.  I suspect it will ghost a pipe but right now I'm using inexpensive pipes as I run through the vast amounts of samples I've acquired to work my way into smoking a pipe and building a rotation of likes.

shavinghobbit: My personal opinion on BRM is that, while a good aromatic the "cult following" it has does the tobacco no real favors. Should people have it in their cellar? Perhaps, if they want the occasional aromatic. Is it the end all be all of tobacco? Certainly not.
