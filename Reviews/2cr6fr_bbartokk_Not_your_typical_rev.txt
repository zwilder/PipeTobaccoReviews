Not your typical review - Savinelli Doblone d'Oro
By: bbartokk
---
I'm terrible at reviewing tobacco. I would love too but I cant eloquently describe what I am tasting. However, /u/TurnerJ5 said we have to provide a review so I decided to do this my way. 

TL:DR - I really like this tobacco. Room notes are light. My gf said it smelled nice and wasnt very strong. The perique gives it a really nice spice. I stuffed the coins into the bowl straight from the tin. The tobacco stayed lit. I will definitely buy more of this!

Now...on to my review. I wrote a story. I get long winded. I'm not a great story teller but I had fun. I hope you enjoy reading it. I tried to play off of the haiku that won me this tobacco to begin with.

bbartokk: *Sailing the Nina*

*Across Savinelli Sea*

*In search of d’Oro*

I woke up with a splitting headache and wet pants. A sharp pain went down my neck as I tried to lift my head up. What happened? Why are my pants wet? As I tried to recall last nights events I was further disturbed by wet sandpaper scraping across my face. I lifted my hands to protect myself and felt wet scraggly fur. [Theodore](http://i.imgur.com/SkDphEx.jpg). At least my faithful mutt was with me. I managed to sit up and thats when I realized I was on a beach. The tide was coming and the sun was [going down](http://i.imgur.com/TbBArzA.jpg). 

Mutiny. Last nights events are starting to come back to me. Who am I? Captain Bbartokk. A fellow philanthropist if you will. Captain of the Amber Rose, which until last night was making its way towards Cartagena. We had been at sea for months chasing a Spanish fleet carrying silver. A bit of bad luck and stormy seas sent us west. I thought we should make for land and explore this new land. Perhaps find our own city of Oro. Apparently the scoundrels disagreed and here we find ourselves. At least they left me with [provisions](http://i.imgur.com/gARFysc.jpg).

I started to make shelter for the night while Theodore, happy that I was alive, went exploring. Some Captains get a parrot that sit on their shoulder. I get a wet, stinky, dirty mutt. At least he decided to stay with me. We settle into the night watching the stars slowly twinkle into existence. We huddled together next to the small fire and Teddy looked over at me as if asking, now what?

Teddy nudged me awake in the [middle of the night](http://i.imgur.com/PWSQChJ.jpg). The embers had little life left. From Theodores stance I could tell something was not right. I heard a faint knocking coming from deeper on the island. I dismissed it as my head pounding again but then I heard it again. Teddy ran towards the woods. Damn that infernal dog. Half of me wanted to let him run off and be eaten. The other half of me also agreed. The pounding continued though. A rhythmic sound that got closer. I threw sand over the fire and chased after the mutt.

We headed deeper into this infernal island. Where were we? I could not think of any islands near our last destination. Had we been pushed that far off course? I looked towards the stars for some guidance but they seemed to turn themselves off, mocking me. Teddy stopped moving forward and we hunched down together. I could hear sounds. Guttural human sounds but nothing I had encountered before. We slowly crept forward and found a clearing. Thats where we first saw the tribe. A branch snapped behind me and I turned around.

I woke up with a splitting headache. My mother always wanted me to be a doctor and for the first time in my life I regret not listening to her. Men were shouting incoherently. My arms were tied. Poor Theodore was tied up next to me. My mouth felt like the deck of a ship and I tried to speak but managed a whimper. All eyes turned to me and a spear was stuck to my throat. The man with the most decorations in his face slowly stepped up to me and prodded me. I liked his eyes best. I could see concern and compassion. This must be their leader. The man with the spear to my throat had eyes as dark as coal. I tried to speak again but could not. Gentle eyes spoke to a boy and he brought me some water. I looked towards Theodore and the boy understood and gave him some water as well. Gentle eyes then had the boy untie us and we tried to communicate. It was like speaking with the wenches from Tortuga. Neither of us knew what was going on but they took a liking to Teddy. For the time being I was safe.

The tribe took me along with them. We went deeper into their land. Further from the ocean, my love, and my life. Always under the watchful eyes of my captors we walked for days. I was aware of the stories from these lands. Strange beasts roamed the lands and wild men lived in cities of Gold. Tales told to children and Kings to lure them into building you a fleet. Could I be on my way to such city?

[Seven moons](http://i.imgur.com/PWSQChJ.jpg) passed and we finally reached a village. Large buildings rose up amongst the trees. Smoke billowed out of a stone pyramid. All I saw was stone, wood, clay and straw. No gold buildings. No rivers of gold. Fairy tales indeed. My captors led me into a temple where a feast was being prepared. Colors I had never seen before in fruits laid out before us. Beautiful women adorned with jewelry from head to toe floated around the room. The temptation to grab the fruit, or the women, was too great and as I reached out there it was.

[D’Oro](http://i.imgur.com/ktIzrJx.jpg). Nothing I had heard prepared me for the site in front of me. Nothing in the room [glowed as bright](http://i.imgur.com/uzgzWqR.jpg). A [basket filled with coins](http://i.imgur.com/8Q5ItLm.jpg). More than a man could ever wish for. [More than my Amber Rose could carry](http://i.imgur.com/hB6IqGu.jpg). 

This is how I, [Captain Bbartokk](http://i.imgur.com/Q7zYjVi.jpg), of the Amber Rose, pirate of the cursed seas, came to find [Doblone d’Oro](http://i.imgur.com/xDPxUwC.jpg). The treasure of the Savinelli Seas. I’m going to need a [bigger boat](http://i.imgur.com/wTTHwT2.jpg).

xDemagog: Is there a TL;DR version of this? As much as I love the creativity (I do), I kinda just wanna know if I'm missing out or not...
