Found this at a local brick and mortar shop in Troy MI selling at a heavy enough discount it was worth it to me.  I feel like the main question most people want answered when they read any sort of product review is “is it worth buying this thing?” 

To get that out of the way as early as possible, no.  Unless you really like the design, which I do enough to not make me regret the purchase only at a heavy discount, it’s not worth it.

That said I have never tried smoking this pipe with a 9mm filter however I do have the adapter installed.  It smokes hot, it’s button is wide to the point that it’s uncomfortable to clench, it’s weight is almost all in the bowl, and it’s drilled very, very wide.  I would compare it’s constuction to that of a basic Missouri Meerschaum.

That said the hole is centered and at the correct depth in the bowl.  It is a strong sitter.  It has become dedicated to Virginia which it smokes very well, providing I rest the pipe for sometime halfway through the smoke. 

It smokes hot due to its design, which is why I bought the pipe. Even when care is taken to make sure the tobacco is packed bellow the metal bowl guard, it still heats up causing the entire pipe to also heat up.  It also takes a while to cool, which I believe is because of the finish used on the pipe.

If you research who built this pipe it’s basically a spruced up Big Ben pipe.  Looking into the series I’m pretty sure it’s a Canterbury 402.  These retail at normal internet price right around 100 dollars.  So whatever you pay over that your paying for the carved grooves, chrome highlights, unique finish, and Porsche design name.

To revisit the initial question, is this worth buying, it entirely depends on how much those components are worth to you.

shinsuke_hazuki: I have looked at those piipes a few times, but always as a cool porsche product, never as a pipe for smoking regularly. Kind of a novelty..  Which b&m is in troy? I live around utica and have struggled to find a local b&m

Nick24601: Smokeys cigar shop.  They also let you smoke your pipe at the jenuines in royal oak as long as you buy a drink and don’t ask if it’s ok.
--
shinsuke_hazuki: Oh wow, I didn’t know there was a jenuwines in royal oak. There is one at hall and Schoenherr.

shinsuke_hazuki: Where in troy is Smokeys?
--
Nick24601: My bad, meant the one on Woodward in Bloomfield hills
--
shinsuke_hazuki: OHHH ok, Thanks!

====================================
Nicepuro: Wow I saw one of these for $180 at a shop a year ago. 
--
Nick24601: Yup, your basically paying 80 bucks for the finish, chrome, and grooves then

daveinlax: I've got a one of the IMO better looking, understated German made billiards NIB at a show years ago and have never smoked it. I talked to a pipe collector who is a international lawyer who worked for Butzi Porsche (911 designer) told me that Mr Porsche was an all day pipe smoker and designed the pipe for himself.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the words of warning. We have very few outright pipe reviews here and this is really appreciated. It is a pretty pipe, as are the other Porsche branded ones. But, though they make a heck of an automobile, I trust them to make a quality pipe as much as I do Savinelli to design a car.
