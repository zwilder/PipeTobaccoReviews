Rust Belt Plug review

====================================
linearone: I had the good fortune to review a custom plug by Zapotecorum. This guy can make a great pipe and great tobacco! It had the dense layered feel of a good european style plug tobacco. If you have ever had Gaslight it is built and feels like this. It totally was a solid brick and sliced well. It was however a bit damp and does require some drying. As can be seen in the pics I think the recipe is pretty much a stoved virginia and nicotina rustica. The strength of the nicotine varies wildly from strong to nuclear I'm told. I got strong. I am not a virginia guy at all but holy crap, I'm hooked on this stuff.  I love it. Strong, earthy, and earthy like an old brown dexter boot soaked in mink oil earthy and dragged through a garden. Had a great stank, Its hard to describe. Folks may not like it because of its raw taste but that is precisely why I love it. The secret here is not only his casings but the fact that he used solid, raw leaf not processed tobacco that has been dried, rehydrated and cased. Superb product. I'd buy it if I could. If you like dark virginias with a kick in the head and want to feel like you fell face first into a mushroom farm, this is it. 
I'm a fan.
Thank you to /u/Zapotecorum for a great treat.

djscollin4: This sounds incredible!

Zapotecorum: Thanks for the write up! I'll let ya know when i make more. Probably gonna make 3 or 4 plugs next time so more people can try it, And post a more detailed recipe so ppl can make it for themselves

As for the 'plume' in pic 2... Kinda hard to believe its the kinda plume we associate with aging, considering it was made about a week ago. Im thinking its probably sugar(honey) from the casing or mold. I'll have to find my loupe and see if theres any on the chunk i have left

Ive got the press soaking in vinegar at the moment, so that will hopefully help prevent mold. and i may experiment with adding vinegar to the casing itself to help further prevent it.

icookthefood: Wow, that sounds delicious.  As a fan of the earthy funkiness of ripe puer tea and bold tobacco I'm intrigued.  Sounds like an umami bomb!
