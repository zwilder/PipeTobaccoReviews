Review: Dan Tobacco Salty Dogs
By: pipingphil
---
A few days ago, I took a trip to Dan Tobaccos headquarters in northern Germany. Let me tell you – this is pipe smoker's heaven! Their shop is filled with all sorts of pipes and the complete Dan Tobacco lineup of blends. There are containers with all sorts of blends which you can smell and help yourself to if you want to try something. Dozens of drawers and racks are filled with pipes and I felt like a kid in a candy store. I didn't take any pictures, so you'll have to take my word for it. 

Furthermore, I was blown away with the friendliness and hospitality of the shop. There was coffee and cake, and the staff encouraged me to take my time and look around, and were very happy to help with any sort of questions. I could have hung out there the whole day, and I'm sure no one would have minded. A very relaxed experience! 

I couldn't decide on a new pipe, unfortunately, but I bought two tobaccos from them, Tumblin' Dice, a cube cut Va/Per, and Salty Dogs, a Va/Per Plug. 

**Description (from tobaccoreviews.com)**: In long-gone times, when imposing sailships crossed the Seven Seas, English sailors were popularly called "Salty Dogs." They always took care to have a pocket-sized block of sweet Virginia tobacco with them, which they would take a slice off to then rub out and smoke in their Cutty pipes. In heavy weather, they would opt to just bite off a corner to enjoy as a stimulating piece of chewing tobacco.

Selected sweet Virginias with a small pinch of Perique, classically enhanced with Caribbean rum, are matured over a long time in the press. The result is a dark brown, full and pleasant pipe tobacco in traditional style offering you a comfortably cool and smooth smoking experience. Unlike ordinary Flakes, it was not cut into slices, but packaged as a solid piece of real plug tobacco. Enjoy it in pipes with smaller bowls. (translated from Dan Tobacco's website)

**The Leaf**: A mostly dark, solid plug with a few lighter strands in between. Fairly firm and compact.

**Tin Note**: Beautiful Va/Per notes with a dark fruity sweetness. Molasses, figs and plums. Mouthwatering. 

**Packing, Lighting & Smokeability**: Preparation is half the fun with plugs. I tend to cut fairly thin slices and rub them out a bit. The plug itself is pretty damp, so the cut pieces need a bit of drying time. I go with 30–40 minutes, but an hour wouldn't hurt as the tobacco can smoke a bit wet. I have yet to try it as flake cut, but as broken flake, Salty Dogs behaves well and stays lit apart from the occasional relight. I tend to pack this rather loosely as I tend to do with broken flakes. Towards the end of the bowl things can get a bit tricky due to wetness. I'll have to try drying it longer, but i have a hard time being patient with this delicious stuff. Nevertheless, it burns cleanly to fine ash. 

**Taste**: A very nice foundation of sweet Virginias meets notes of fermented fruit from the Perique. With the initial light, there is quite a bit of tingly, peppery spice from the Perique as well, which gets more subdued and finds its place within the whole composition after a few puffs. It never goes away, though, the spice just fades more or less into the background, depending on how fast you smoke. The peppery fruitiness of the Perique competes with more citric and tart notes from the Virginias. It's fascinating – the flavors combine into a delicious, darker foundation with a deep sweetness that still lets the fruity and slightly spicy notes of the single components shine through. Dan say, Salty Dogs is topped with Rum which I can not make out. If there is a a topping, it is very light and integrates very well into the overall taste of the blend. All in all a very tasty Va/Per that's right up my alley with just enough spice to make it interesting.  

**Room Note**: I usually smoke outside, but this one is quite pleasant. Notes of stoved fruit (fruit tart maybe?) and figs. Even the girlfriend considered the aroma to be "cozy". 

**Nicotine**: You'll definitely notice that you are smoking, not overpowering as long as you pace yourself, but still noticeable. Strength increases towards the end of the bowl. Quite a bit above medium, I would say. 

**Thoughts**: I liked this stuff from the very first puffs. Being a plug, this has the added bonus of enhancing the ritual aspect of preparation which I like. I consider this tobacco a real treat, similar to Dunhil's Deluxe Navy Rolls. While it is not overly complex, it's a deeply satisfying, delicious smoke that I find myself lusting for since I got it. Until now, I didn't pay to much attention to Dan's offerings, but that changed with the last two tobaccos I got from them. Maybe I’ll throw in another plug with my next order to see how it ages… 

I have no idea how available this tobacco is outside of Germany, but if you get the chance, I encourage you to try it!

**Pairing**: Pairs beautifully with Earl Grey or a fruity green tea. Should also work with a light IPA or even a fruity Speyside Single Malt. 

**Rating**: 4/5

**About Me**: I've been smoking a pipe for about a year now after a few years of the occasional cigar here and there. I’m generally not a huge Latakia nut, but like Virginias, and VaPers a lot and have gotten a taste for Burley and Kentucky lately. 
====================================
hedonaut: Great review. Dan makes some fantastic stuff. Is this available at all in the States?
--
pipingphil: Thanks! I honestly don't think that it's available in the States, since Dan introduced this only about a year ago. However, I understand that some US retailers carry a few of their blends, so maybe there's hope.  
--
====================================
None: That sounds pretty good.
--
pipingphil: Oh, it is good. Frankly, I have the jar sitting on my desk, so that I can take a quick whiff from time to time... 
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice write up pipemate. Any similar tobaccos you could name?
--
pipingphil: Well, as far as plugs go, this is my first. In the realm of sweet Va/Pers, there's Solani 633 which is similar. Also, DDNR fall into a similar category, although they tend to be more on the 'baked goods' sweetness side of things.

====================================
cgrd: Thanks for including a picture of the tobacco.

pipingphil: Sure! Words can only go so far. Besides, I like taking pictures.
