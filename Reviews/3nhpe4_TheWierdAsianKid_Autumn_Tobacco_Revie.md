Autumn Tobacco review

* Along with my haul of autumn tobaccos I bought a Missouri Meerschaum ozark hardwood maple pipe, all of these autumn tobaccos will be smoked in this, and I hope the flavors don’t get too muddled with one another. I should also mention I am not that experienced with pipe tobacco. 

**Straus Tobacco - Sleepy Hollow**

The tobacco itself -  It smells fantastic, a nicely sweet/spice smell of nutmeg or cinnamon with some vanilla and a very notable hint of caramel. The consistency of it was great, perfectly moist and not too airy. No big clumps of the tobacco, and good sized pieces of leaf that packs into a pipe very well. I didn’t have much trouble packing it, but thinking back, I realize that I could have used a bit more pressure. 

Smoking it - lighting it was very easy. Despite it being very windy out I only needed to light it three times, and it kept burning very evenly. With my initial puffs of lighting I did not get any bite, usually with my Zippo pipe lighter I will get a hot draw and can taste the butane. Once lit I only tamped it once and re lit twice, and only tamped two more times the entire time I smoked it. The flavor of Sleepy Hollow is incredible, much like the smell it’s a very sweet/spicy taste. However it’s not overly sweet while still remaining very pleasurable. While smoking it an acquaintance of mine showed up unexpectedly and I offered for him to try it. He equated the taste to a chai tea, something I am unfamiliar with. I never got any tongue bite with this tobacco, and my pipe never got incredibly hot. 
I mostly puffed this but did inhale a bit. It never hurt my throat or lungs, and had a comfortable level of nicotine. 

Final thoughts - I would rate this 9/10. For a mellow aromatic it was wonderful all around. Big thanks to /u/soymilkisgood for selling me some of it.  

**McClelland Mellow Apple**

The tobacco itself - There is a notable smell of apples with an earthy tone that is hard to describe. Very good moisture content, and it’s a mix of lightly colored thin strands (not angel hair like 5 Brothers) and larger flakes of dark tobacco. It smells fairly good, not too strong. While being a tad airy, it packs very well without springing up too much.

Smoking it - Upon starting this bowl it appears that the tobacco may have been a bit dry. On my second light the top caught on fire and I had to blow on it to put it out. In my first few puffs I did get quite a bit of bite both on my tongue on the back of my throat. The bowl was also very warm. I let it sit for a few minutes and then sook smaller puffs and it mellowed out. At first I didn’t taste anything very distinct, but on a few good puffs the taste of a crisp apple and the smell of a fresh apple orchard rushed to me. I was pleasantly surprised. I continued to get a small amount of bite as I smoked but it was manageable. After inhaling for bit I noticed some nicotine that lingered in my head for a bit. The aftertaste of Mellow Apple is not bad at all, not much apple flavor but not bitter or anything. 

Final thoughts - I would give this a 6/10. While not constantly tasting of apples there is definitely a special note that is sometimes more prevalent while smoking. I would definitely recommend smoking this with a nice hot cup of apple cider. 

**Russ's Blends - Cinnamon Roll**

The tobacco itself - A great moisture content, consistency is very nice, lots of good sized pieces of leaf and a nice rich dark color. Smelling it you can definitely smell a cinnamon spice, yet it still retains a nice earthy tobacco scent, either is not too strong. Packing my pipe was easy, nothing too special there. 

Smoking it - wasn't difficult to get my bowl lit, only had to light three times while tamping twice, and then tamping once more later while smoking. I wasn't fantastically impressed with the flavor because nothing was too strong, but that's also really nice. You definitely taste a sweetness that's nicely complemented by that hint of spice, and a good taste of mellow tobacco. In addition I never got any bite, and my pipe never got hot, the smoke and tobacco kept a good heat. The only issue I had while smoking was the moisture. Towards the end of my bowl I got a gurgling from it being a tad too moist, but that wasn't too unpleasant, especially since I had a filter. Upon inhaling nothing was too bad, not throat bite and a nice amount of nicotine. 

Final thoughts - This gets a strong 8/10. Very comforting mellow spice flavor while not being too sweet. Only issue I had was the moisture. I would recommend smoking this with a cup of some aromatic coffee like pumpkin spice or hazelnut 

**McClellan Fresh Apple**

The tobacco itself - The consistency of this Fresh Apple is obviously very similar to McClelland’s Mellow Apple, however it is a bit ‘bulkier’ as in some of the ribbons are not as thin. The smell is also very similar, however the Fresh Apple is definitely more sweet. 
Packing was easy, nothing bad here. 

Smoking it - Here is where Fresh apple really shines, especially compared to Mellow Apple. It may have been because it’s a just a tad more moist, but I definitely had a much more enjoyable experience with this than Mellow Apple. It lit easily and stayed consistent throughout my session. Also, in comparison to Mellow Apple, I never had as much bite, there was a bit but only when I inhaled. In addition, my pipe never got hot, but the smoke was a tad warm. However the flavor was so much better than the Mellow Apple. While Mellow Apple occasionally tasted of apple, this constantly tasted like a fresh, juicy apple. It was also a bit sweeter which was great. The aftertaste was also much better, a mellow tobacco and apple flavor lingered comfortably. 

Final thoughts - Fresh Apple definitely gets an 8/10. Good smoking experience with a consistent sweet apple taste. Like Mellow Apple I would suggest smoking this with a hot cup of apple cider. 


In Pt.2 I will be reviewing Russ's Blends Apple Fritter, Snow Drift, and Chocolate Covered Espresso Bean, C&D Autumn Evening, and H&H Caramel Apple Pie.

Please leave critiques/comments so I can better review the next batch of tobaccos

pylorns: Great reviews, I missed out of sleepy hollow last year. 

Other fall tobaccos: Sutliff Pumpkin Spice and Taste of Autumn.  C&D Mixture Monster, which I missed snagging some of this year. 
--
TheWierdAsianKid: Sleepy Hollow is definitely a great smoke. I do have some C&D Autumn Evening coming once P&C has it available. I would like to try mixture monster but at $15 for such a large amount I am weary. I also have tried some other Sutliff aromatics (fruit and tropical) and was greatly disappointed, But i may be willing to try some of their autumn selections.
--
chewsyourownadv: Mixture Monster is on SmokingPipes.com right now.
--
pylorns: Just grabbed it, I thought they were out - but that must have been the bulk version.

TheWierdAsianKid: No problem. I still have 5 more tobaccos to post once my back ordered C&D autumn evening comes in. I'm also debating on ordering about 3 more tobaccos
