"Okay. I've smoked cigarettes for 7 years. Became interested in pipe tobacco, thinking there might be something good there, so I bought some to give it a whirl. This has hands down been the most important discovery of mine since Carl Jung or punk rock... . It's like I've been eating hay all of my life and just tried ice cream for the first time. Like I just woke up out of the Matrix. I feel like that chick from Titanic like, "I'm flying, Jack!" I feel like God just spoke to me, imparting sacred knowledge and wisdom. I now know the meaning of life, I am an enlightened human being. Cigarettes ain't got nothin' on this."

====================================
Wonberger: If you just smoked cigarettes and tried this as your first pipe tobacco, yeah probably. It’s a super solid English and one of my favorites but don’t build it up too much in your head before you try it.
--
indiefolkfan: I did and was disappointed. Personally I think it's just an ok blend.
--
sunshinelov1n: how much whiskey flavor do you get, I love whiskey, so i was really excited to hear about this.

Also do you know of any other whiskey flavored tobaccos?
--
Wonberger: It probably depends on your palate. I’m a pretty new smoker so the whisky notes I get are very, very mild but an experienced smoker would be able to pick up more of it. If I’m not mistaken there isn’t any whiskey casing or topping on FMC, all the flavor comes from the stave cubes that they’re aged with. There are a ton of whiskey aromatics out there though, but I don’t have any experience with them.

freepancakesforall: If you want a whiskey flavored tobacco there are stronger/better than this. Frog Morton Cellar is latakia dominant which can take on some smokey characteristics that are similar to whiskey notes. Then add in that it's aged with whiskey staves and you've got yourself an English smoke with the essence of whiskey. But it's by no means a full, whiskey-flavored tobacco.

cmdr_andrew_dermott: Cellar is pretty subtle on the whiskey.

Nutty Irishman, in the other hand...

====================================
BossHogg_67: Just tried it myself for the first time the other day. Very good, but not a life-changing experience. SPC Plum Pudding and Dunhill Nightcap were both much more of a “wow” the first time I tried them. 
--
freepancakesforall: +1 on the Plum Pudding. Maybe it was the hype, but Cellar fell short for me. It felt like a one-trick show pony. Whereas cracking a tin of Plum Pudding feels like the entire circus.
--
cmdr_andrew_dermott: Almost makes me want to try Plum Pudding.
--
====================================
Dubroq: Yup.  Not even a little underwhelming when I first smoked it.  
--
====================================
Bankus: Hyperbole

====================================
Tis-a-FleshWound: For some it's the end all/be all and for others it's just "meh". Personally I love it. When i can't decide what to smoke, I'll puff some FMC until I figure it out. If it ends up that you don't like it, I'm sure someone will help you trade it off for something else (pssst...PM me bruh). 

If you like it now, wait until you find that perfect pairing to go with the toebacky. I've got a couple Kentucky Vanilla Barrel Ales that I'm saving to go with the FMC and a wee dram (or 5) of bourbon that I want to test drive with some Heinrich's Dark Strong Flake. I will be doing some experimentation around the fire this weekend, ya know...for science!

====================================
professor_throway: Meh. I was very underwhelmed. I thought it was OK when I first tried it. Slowly worked my way through about 25g of a 100g tin and gave the rest away. It wasn't bad, it was just underwhelming. It was too sweet for my taste and lacked all the complexity and depth that is the hallmark of a good English mixture. 

Across the Pond was the jewel of the Frog Morton crown, unfortunately it is no more.

====================================
brennanw1996: So the general consensus in the replies you've gotten have been "good, but not life changing". That in and of itself should push you to try it, but for me personally it's my favorite blend. I've tried a few Englishes (nightcap, on the town, sasieni, gaslight, squadron leader, etc) and cellar is easily my favorite blend ever. I get more whiskey flavor from that than I do from retrohaling aros. At worst you'll think it's okay, and at best you'll love it like me and a bunch of others. There is no hating FMC.

--
====================================
Aboleth_Whisperer: Definitely exaggerated, and probably colored by the fact that it sounds like he was possibly discovering high quality tobacco for the first time.  But hey, it's a good blend if you like latakia/caramel.  Is it caramel?  I don't know what it is, but it's smooth and sweet and smoky overall as a blend.
--
====================================
Lbarraa: It’s a great tobacco, but IMO probably FM’s Cellar is the most “aromatic” of all the serie.  Probably the review that you refers it’s a little too much. I like FM on the town more than any other, but it’s my personal taste.
