[Review] Cornell & Diehl: Three Friars

Blend Name: Cornell & Diehl: Three Friars

Description on Tin:  A combination of Virginia ribbon, Brown Virginia Burley, and Perique, C&D's Three Friars delights with a combination of natural piquant sweetness and spice. (If anyone could post the actual tin description I would be grateful, i want to know what C&D actually put on the tin if anything.)

Leaf: Classic C&D dryness. Burley seems to dominate the blend followed by perique and then both virginia's. Easy to pack just don't get rough with it. I've seen people compare Three Nuns to Three Friars and I don't know why, these are two completely different blends and cuts.

Tin Aroma: A earthy note with some fig and nut, the fermented perique smell is also there. I wish this came in another form, a flake or a cake would be really nice to marry all these smells together. Not to say the note isn't nice it just doesn't seem very constructed.

Taste: Now where the tin aroma was lacking and seemed hodgepodge the taste creates a very nice base for the note. This is a nice earthy smokiness, with a nice spice from the perique. Behind all of that is the sweeter virginia which is like a little heavy cream is a black coffee. This could break it for some people, if they were after that black coffee kinda burley flavor with some perique. For me it was nice, but made me curious for a flip side to the coin.

Smokability: Easy to light and a good slow smoke if you pack it in the frank method. It burns a little fast and hot with the spiral method which doesn't handle these short chunky "ribbons" very well. This is an all day smoke for me with no stand-out attributes but it also doesn't fall short in any area either.

Room Note: A good burley note in the nose with the spice of perique, when I retrohaled I got a good bit of sweeter virginia out of it which just like the taste gave me a "creamer" to go with the darker burley notes. All this over the spice of perique makes for a nice daily smoke if you like your perique and burley.

Thoughts: To me more of a Bur-Per than a Va-Per. I really really can't not stress how much I think a pressed form of this in a flake or cake would make a world of difference in the flavor department. If I could I would by a pound press it at home and send it back for C&D's consumption. As it is I feel like there are blends that come closer to what this one wants to be.

Recommend to: People who like a more Burley forward daily smoke. This could well be my workhorse blend if I hadn't invested in a few lbs of P.S. LNF & LTF, but that's only because its so smokeable not really because of the flavors or notes. If you like Carter Hall and wish it came without PG and had a little more virginia and a nice handful of perique this is one you might try.

Summary: I enjoyed this blend, I really did. It's an excellent all day smoke for me. I blazed through my sample with abandon content every moment. Content but not quite satisfied if you get what I mean.

I mention its shortcomings for one reason only: I felt it fell short of what it could be. Like a kid in school busy doodling, this blend doesn't seem to focus and come together. Not to say it falls short in any category, it smokes well, tastes brilliant, and has a pleasant note I just feel like this blend could use a revamp and a heavier flavor profile which I think this blend is aiming for. Press it into submission would be my answer.

My Background: Is it ok to copy pasta my background it hasn't changed...3 years smoking a pipe, previous nail smoker. I occasionaly enjoy a cigar. Although my taste in cigar are frowned upon. Tasted this in a briar, cob, and a clay, as usual. It's just a nice trifecta to range a blend with. 

Also took a two day break from smoking after the Haddo's review just to clear the tastebuds. I was going to wait to post this till tomorrow sometime, but the baby decided to be fussy so I had nothing better to do than finish this for you all to enjoy tonight as I smoke and enjoy some coffee.

Anything that you do to make this blends flavors pop let me know, I feel like I'm letting C&D down because I typically enjoy their blends alot more than I did this one.

====================================
BWeice: Three friars is my life, seriously. I would love to try it pressed as a crumble cake.. I might have to buy another pound and try it out one day since I have a half pound of it loose aging now.

As for not getting the most out of the flavors, I'm not surprised I don't believe it to have anything really outstanding just your run of the mill burley and perique with a bit of virginia sweetness.. I do however find it better to be smoked somewhat hotter than if you were to smoke as you would pure VA.

Sku77s: I had mixed feelings on this review I didn't want to scare people away and I hope I haven't.

To clarify I enjoyed my sample of Three Friars, I just feel that there's some untapped potential here that could be unlocked with a good pressing. Taking a **good** smoke to a **wow that's something else** kind of level.

This is a wonderful blend I'm stressing this as I am enjoying my last bit of Friars. No doubt I could smoke this as my only perique blend and be happy as a clam; but I feel like it *could* be more with a little more attention from C&D.

On a side note I have an infatuation for C&D cakes. Damn good stuff.

BWeice: No doubt about it, it would be real interesting. Glad you enjoyed it!
