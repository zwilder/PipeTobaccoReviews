Dunhill's Durbar - A Review
By: VilaFrancaWeimar
---
When you search for Durbar on the internet, the result is usually an elder’s court in faraway lands. Why has Dunhill decided that this would be an appropriate name for a mixture? Well, first of all, it takes us all the way to the orient, like the tobacco itself, but it also shows us that this is an “aristocratic” type of mixture. What does that mean? It means that it is generally for the experienced, that there is some sort of complexity that the recent piper will not apprehend in a total manner. The thing is, the law is for everyone, it applies to the young and old, and to the experienced and to the newbies, so don’t let the name scare you! Therefore, I really wanted you to picture this in your mind, a place where colors are distributed freely, where cows are sacred, where people are friendly, where everything is strange enough to be fun, but not strange enough to feel like a totally different planet. This is an oriental. The tale of the oriental mixture is, when I think about it, a tale of the west, in the sense that we define ourselves by the distance and the strangeness (in a very literal sense) of the unknown. Pair that with the British Empire and you have the English mixture that, before the colonies do their own thing, has two typologies: The standard Latakia-Virginia or the oriental forward mixture. In a philosophical and distanced stance, we only have classical English mixtures because there are not so classical ones, and if Nightcap is a heavy classical English, or Early Morning a light one, Durbar should be seen as the quintessential Dunhill version of an oriental. We can only define ourselves with something antagonistic, and this something should really be explored if you need an adventure, or if you just want to know what is out there. Now, I am a huge fan or orientals, my favorite one is Presbyterian, and I already reviewed Gordon Pym, a mixture that could be defined as an oriental forward mixture, but I feel that this is a better mixture to be introduced to if you never tried it. This is the reason I called it the quintessential oriental mixture.  

Dunhill’s Durbar is an oriental forward English mixture, and a great one!

Before the smoke:

Classic Dunhill ribbon cut, very easy to pack your pipe with.  Smells like leather, like absolutely tremendous leather. One can also pick up some rot, in a good way, like something as been fermenting in a can. Maybe it is just because I have been aging this tin for little over a year, but I have a feeling that this mixture is consistent, like every Dunhill I have picked up. The brand is in vogue for some reason, I guess, because it never disappointed me. 

Beginning of the smoke:

Real smooth flavor wise, but burns kind of hot for an English blend, no matter how slow I smoke it. Be careful with that because it can make smoking it kind of a chore. Being too hot might render it without much flavor. So really take your time with it.

During the smoke:

The first half is smooth and inviting. I imagine that if I didn’t know what an oriental was, that this would be a very balanced way to be introduced. Not too spicy, not too much tartness, or tanginess, everything just works in an equilibrium. It is not a strong kick in the beginning, but it sneaks up on you in a somehow subtle but hardcore manner. By the middle of it, it is a strong and manly smoke. It is somewhat of a bipolar smoke, but that is kind of cool in my view because it means that it clearly isn’t a boring one. By this second half you really start to feel some hints of iron in the taste, everything dissipates in it. It is very salty and savory, but it extremes itself all the way up to the end. I would say it is the perfect way to get to know the distinguishable flavors of this type of mixture if you don’t know anything about them, but for someone that already is familiar with them might be too “middle of the road”. Think of it as a “best of” album: super consistent in the sense that it shows you almost all the things this type of blend can show you, but if you already know the songs back and forward it can be kind of unexciting and there are plenty of records you would prefer. It is also super “smoky”, so if you like a good barbeque you will love the campfire feel to it. 

After the smoke:

Don’t really love the aftertaste, kind of heavy and ashy. The beard note is strong, but the people around me say that the room note is nice. Be advised that these people like a good pipe once in a while. The smoke is leathery and earthy in a good way. I personally would advise against smoking it in closed quarters if you are not accompanied with smokers.


Overview:

Try it for yourself, because my opinion is really not very valuable for itself. I like this type of mixture, and if you don’t know if you do, you should really experience it for yourself. If you already know you will like it, buy a tin and try it. If you get disappointed, age it and you will probably love it in a couple of years. I think that the only thing that might be controversial towards different palates is its strength halfway, but if you age it, the edge goes away, like any Latakia blend. Complex enough to be challenging, but not too much, I wouldn’t call it an all-day blend, but it is not really a night time only type of mixture. If you are a newbie, it is an after dinner blend, if you are Ron Swanson, it can be breakfast. It will not overwhelm you with flavors, but they are there. 

Recommended readings:

-I have been feeling very romantic while listening to Kate Bush, so I would recommend Wuthering Heights

-Orientalism By Edward Said if you feel like understanding the position of “Otherness” (be very careful while reading because no one wants another SJW in reddit)

-The new Morrissey record, because that is basically poetry


Thank you for your patience, everyone who read the review and also u/antiwittgenstein , I hope you enjoyed the review!



====================================
professor_throway: As much as I like Durbar, I am going to express a contrary opinion. I think London Mixture is the star of Dunhill's oriental lineup.

Excellent review!
--
givemeyours0ul: I disagree. DURBAR ALL THE WAY. London was ho-hum for me.
--
professor_throway: That's why there are 2 blends! How awesome if it that we have access to all these high quality blends that we can debate subtleties.

LM is comes across as a bit spicier and aggressive  to me. Durbar seems smoother and cleaner.
--
givemeyours0ul: Mayhaps I need to revisit London Mix. I did a grand tour of Dunhill blends when they were on sale, deciding what to cellar, and at the time it just didn't stand out. I'll be interested to see what 6 months in the jar has done to it. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: It might very well be, I honestly don't hold the absolute truth in the palm of my hand. I just hope you understand that my experiences are subjective, and that I would never say something like: the go to mixture of all times is x. I will probably review London mixture in the future and get my subjective view on it aswell. I am really glad you liked my review!

====================================
ThePipeSigh: Well done. And an interesting experience that is very different from my own! Durbar had been my number one for some time before trying LJ Peretti Cuban Mixture.

 I actually just smoked a bowl of Durbar last night. Just to add a little contrast to what you've experienced, for the sake of any who've not tried it, I've always found it to be a remarkably cool smoke. It's sweet, smokey, and gets spicy towards the finish of the bowl. However, smoking it after you pop the tin is definitely not recommended. It should be jarred for at least a month. This will make all the difference in the world. From the tin, the flavors will combat and can be a little bland. I typically will gently shake the jar from time to time.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: It might have been my problem because I did not put it in a jar. I have actually aged it in the sealed tin itself (waited and then oppened it). Its not like it burns super hot, I just noticed that compared to most of the english blends I have smoked it gets much warmer much faster. As to the flavor differences, you are probably right, but off the tin, as I have smoked, this was the experience I got. As you said, spicy, smokey, and even though I didn't mention there are some sweet undertones especially in the beggining. It is a very balanced smoke, and the next tin I get, I will jar it in the moment! Thank you for your comment.
--
ThePipeSigh: It was a pleasure to read this review. I don't think Durbar gets enough attention. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you very much for the feedback, I'm really glad you liked my review!

VilaFrancaWeimar: It's a very good mixture, and if you try others in the dunhill roster you will understand what you like and what you don't like as much. Just know that not every non aromatic blend is like durbar. There is a huge universe of non-aromatic pipe tobacco that will really open your mind and tastebuds to things you didn't expect. Thank you for your experience and comment!
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: I love orientals but haven't given this one a try yet. Care to compare it to some more orientals?
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Ir is very much like Gordon pym, but dan tobacco's mixture seems to be kind of heavy in tanguiness, while this one is much more balanced with spice aswell. A lot of people online say it tastes like white knight, something that I have no way to know because I have no access to that blend.
--
====================================
hbd85: Nice review. Btw, you should try GLP Westminster and publish another review.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Unfortunatelly some blends are really illegal and hard to come by in my part of the world, so that future review seems to be very unlikely. Glad you liked it!
--
ThatGuyGaren: Out of curiosity, what part would that be? I face a similar problem myself here in Lebanon. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: I live in Portugal, one of the places with stricter importing laws in europe when it comes do tobacco. If anything (outside of the EU) gets caught in the mail, there is immediate confiscation and destruction. You will also likely pay a fine. Other places in europe are generally more relaxed. What is your situation like? Is your problem recent, due to international changes in the area, or has it always been like this?
--
ThatGuyGaren: I don't really know if they make you pay fines, but I'm certain that they'll confiscated and destroy any tobacco related products caught in the mail as it is strictly forbidden to import any without a permit, although they're much more lax if you just bring it in your luggage. Oddly enough, the only place to buy dunhill blends is at the airport duty free, although it's just 4 blends. Think it's been like this for a good while. Sucks filling up my smokingpipes cart with on sale tobaccos and not actually being able to buy them. Honestly the permit is seeming more and more worth it every day. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: I know that cart feeling! Well, at least you can try the permit, because we here don't have that option. The only thing that "saved" me are online stores inside the EU. Maybe there is one in Lebanon? 
--
ThatGuyGaren: Only downside of the permit is that it costs like $600 and is hard to get haha. No online shops selling any pipe tobacco in Lebanon sadly, so I'm limited to whatever I can get locally, which isn't much, and whatever I get visiting friends and family to get.

By the way, great review!
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Hey, it you have a job and can partake with that amount of money, it doesn't seem like a complete absurd ammount, think that you will only spend it once, right? I wish you the best, and thank you for your kind words.
--
====================================
aelmer2821: Well, Durbar is now on my list to try. I too am a fan of Wuthering Heights, as I can be a sap. I will take a look at Orientalism, I haven't read it. I counter your Morrisey record with some Classic Cult (mostly because I am not a Smiths fan).  Great review though man, kudos!
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you very much, for your words and great suggestions!
