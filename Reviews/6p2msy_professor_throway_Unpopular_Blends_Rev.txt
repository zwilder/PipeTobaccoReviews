Unpopular Blends Review: Mixture 79
By: professor_throway
---
I was a bit surprised that given the number of negative comments about the blend there are very few actual reviews of it posted here. [The most recent is from /u/Fuzzy_Totemz about 6 months back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/5tponv/after_much_hesitation_mixture_79/?ref=search_posts)

* Blend Name: Sutliff Tobacco Company Mixture No. 79

* Manufacturer's Description: Rich burley tobaccos, blended to the original, time-honored formula of the Sutliff's of California, maintains the tradition of this perennial favorite. A topping of natural vanilla flavoring gives this basic pipe tobacco blend a soft, sweet aroma to enhance its already mild, biteless, round taste.

* Cut: Messy coarse cut

* Tin Aroma: Rootbeer, sassafras, vanilla, anise, with whiskey. It smells like heaven to me.

* Taste: The topping is so heavy I do not taste the tobacco at all. Maybe a hint of nuttiness or cocoa from the burley but that is about it. The rootbeer and anise so strong in the pouch note don't come through in the taste either. Instead I get heavy perfume and floral tastes with a vanilla overnote. The perfumey, floral, maybe soapy taste doesn't really dissipate down the bowl but stays strong throughout. Lakeland essence on steroids. It is like someone mixed Ennerdale with Grasmere toppings then decided it wasn't quite enough. 

* Smokability: Set and forget. It is moist with some PG but not overly done. It does dry well and doesn't get goopy at the bottom of the bowl. I think this could get real bitey if it gets hot, but with small sipping it stays very cool.

* Room Note: Perfumed rootbeer.

* Thoughts: I don't understand the hate for this blend. Sure it is obnoxious but I think it tastes great.I couldn't smoke this all day, it would be tastebud overload. Don't try looking for subtlety with the blend, there isn't any. It is a full on drag show with musical numbers, burlesque dancers, and filthy innuendo. You don't eat ghost pepper chili to expecting to savor the meat and tomato base. 

* Recommend to: Who else should try good of Mix. 79? You probably should. Who will like it? Here is a handy quiz - 

    Would you rather have a nice lager or a spiced Belgian Christmas beer?

    Would you rather drink a Pepsi or a brewery made rootbeer?

    Red Twizzlers or salted black Dutch licorice?

    Axe body spray or lavender after shave?

    Pepperoni NYC pizza or Napoli with anchovy and black olives?

    Dunhill Flake or Ennerdale?

    Rice pudding or Cardamom and rosewater kheer?

    Tic Tacs or Sens Sens?

    Steak and potatoes or Fish with Thai shrimp paste?
 
    If you picked the second option more often it is probably for you. If you like the taste of C. Howards Violet Candy or Scented Gum it is definitely for you.

* My Background: Cigarette smoke for 20 years. Quit 8 years ago and intermittently smoked a pipe or cigar. In the last year picked up the pipe much more and smoke about 7 bowls a week.



====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Great review. I lol'd at the drag show. Doesn't sound like it's for me, but if I was gifted a bowl or two id smoke it and try to capture the drag show musical number magic haha.

====================================
zero-hunter: You had me at C. Howard's Violet Candy. I love that stuff 
--
professor_throway: I love it. My wife won't kiss me for hours after I eat one though, she says it tastes like laundry soap.

====================================
Fuzzy_Totemz: i hate anise but when i smoked 79, it was just savory burley to my palate versus what the tin note hinted at

mine wasnt very wet though nor did it seem overly dressed

--
professor_throway: Wierd, how inconsistent things seem to be sometimes. Mine was from a fresh pouch from P&C and it was really wet. I could smell a strong rootbeer odor from the pouch before I opened the cellophane wrapper on the outside.

====================================
FlyFreak: Where can I find mixture 79, I was under the impression it was discontinued.
--
professor_throway: Nah, you can get it from any of the online retailers. [P&C has is for $4.75 a pouch](https://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/mixture-no-79-pipe-tobacco/1472994/).

FlyFreak: Thanks, a quick google search after my comment showed me I was misinformed by who I was talking to.

====================================
fimpster: Nice review. I was sooo close to adding an once of this to my SP order this afternoon; I was just a couple bucks short of free shipping, but decided to add something else instead. I will have to get some of this, I need to know what all the hate is about.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the warning. I was gonna dip into this one to see what the noise was about but anything smacking of lakeland is not my scene. Keep up the community service.

professor_throway: Yeah it is an American Lakeland in the truest sense, cheaper and totally over the top.
