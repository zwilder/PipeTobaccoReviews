[Review] Dark Fired Kentucky
By: Tobacconism
---
I picked up some bulk Dark Fired Kentucky for blending, but ever the dedicated scientist, smoked it straight tonight.  Holy shit is it good.  Basically a burly that has been smoke cured like a Latakia, but without the (to me) unpleasant incense flavor, Dark Fired Kentucky has the spiciness of a fine Oriental, the smokiness of a Latakia, and the nicotine/tobacco flavor of a burly.  How is this not in more blends?  Yes, there is a bit of harshness to it, but to be honest, that's what you want out of tobacco sometimes.  
 
 
Bottom line, I think I could live off this stuff.  
 
 
 
 
if any of you are mixing your own va/pers, it might be worth experimenting with augmenting and/or replacing the Perique with Dark Fired Kentucky.  It's brilliant.

====================================
eelapl: This is why I like RO's Firestorm so much. Great VaPer with DFK. Highly recommend if you haven't tried it.
--
PastorPuff: I've been hearing a lot about this one lately. Really that good?
--
====================================
saintbubbles: Dark Fired Kentucky is one of my favorite tobaccos. For me it started with Hearth and Home El Nino and Orlik Dark Strong Kentucky. I've progressed to MacBaren HH Old Dark Fired Flakes and GL Pease JackKnife Plug. I'm constantly looking for different blends with DFK.

====================================
hicetnunc37: Try some Kendal from Gawith Hogarth. I almost don't want to smoke anything else. 
--
====================================
hello_josh: Newminster Superior Round Slices are a great little VA coin with a center of DFK, so good and really cheap too.
--
ontariopiper: Added a 1oz sample of this to my last order. First bowl was ok but not great. Letting it age a bit in a mason jar before trying it again. Actually, it might be just about time.....
--
hello_josh: Mine is about a year old, I don't remember how it compares to a fresh sample. I do have a recent half-pound batch that I could compare though.

LaphroaigianSlip: Might I direct you to one of my favorites:

Flure-de-Lis

Virginia, Kentucky Dark Fired, and Perique.  I'd love to see this style become ubiquitous with a menagerie of blends with these three so there would be as many different ones to try as there are English blends. 

The Kentucky Dark Fired takes the bite out of the Virginia and gives that delicious smoked tobacco flavor, the Perique is just being a delicious Perique and supporting the Virginia. It's just fantastic.

It's the flavor of a VaPer with the all day smokability of an English.

====================================
LizMixsMoker: if you like Va/Pers with DFK try Rattrays Old Gowrie and Hal o' the Wynd.

And if you can, pick up some Toscano cigars, they are cheap machine rolled (also available in hand rolled editions) cheroots made of American and/or Italian grown aged Kentucky.

Edit: Almost forgot, you might also like SG Lakeland dark

bub166: You nailed it with the latakia comparison. I've recently indulged in some HH Old Dark Fired, and it's everything I've always wanted latakia to be. I've always liked the smoky quality of latakia, but the incense taste really throws me off. The Kentucky leaf lets me have that smokiness while still getting a nice natural tobacco flavor, as opposed to the almost perfume-like quality I find in Englsh blends.
--
====================================
pipeandpendulum: A great blend to be sure, and I second on the HH Dark fired.  Its bliss...
--
====================================
C-Ray6: Love this post. My perception of pipe tobacco as I knew it was stood on it's  head when I first had a blend with DFK in it. Completely  changed my opinion on Burley.
--
====================================
briarconsequences: I really want to like dark fired, but it really doesn't like my tongue.  I come back to it every so often, just to make sure, and so far we're not getting along.  
--
====================================
ontariopiper: Dark fired Kentucky is the only thing that makes a VA flake palatable to me. Had zero luck enjoying a VA flake of any kind until I tried McConnell's Folded Flake at my last pipe club meeting. It's made of Virginias, fired Kentucky and Perique. Went home and ordered some! 
--
None: Not to be rude but how does one not like Virginias? 
--
ontariopiper: Virginia tobacco is a major part of just about all blends, and it does its job well. I don't care for it on its own, though. I find straight VA boring; I prefer blends with a bit more heft to them, I guess. The fired Kentucky in the McConnell Folded Flake provides the extra dimension that speaks to my palate. 

Every now and then I'll sample some straight VA to see if my tastes have changed, but so far it's been consistent. The good news is that there are enough blends out there to let each pipe smoker find what works for them!

====================================
linearone: What brand did you smoke and where did you purchase it?
--
Tobacconism: Cornell & Diehl.  I bought it online.  I'd rather not say where because it seems there's some vendor bashing (and probably a fair amount of shilling) going on here lately and I don't want to get involved in that in any way.  
--
====================================
None: I picked up a tin last Thursday of Orlik Dark Strong Kentucky and I wholly concur. The stuff is simply great. It's got a sweet topping which is a balanced out with a pepper strong finish. Dark fired Kentucky tobacco is amazing. 
--
====================================
DeaconOrlov: My favorite home blend features the C&D Dark Fired Burley and it is easily the best thing I've ever done with blending my own.  3 parts Stokebye Virginia, 1 part C&D Burley, and 1/2 part each C&D Latakia and McClelland East Carolina Ribbon.  

It's got that great woodsmoke campfire thing going on with some ever so mildly sweet spice from the interplay of the Virginia and Latakia.  I've been cautioned by a user her before that Dark Burley and Latakia play very much alike but in this ratio they both shine well and the Burley is obvious star of this blend.  It also has a really strong nicotine hit that leaves me feeling almost too relaxed after smoking a full bowl.
