[Tobacco Review] McClelland's Brindle Flake
By: DrScience11
---
**Blend Name**: Brindle Flake (The McClelland revival of an ashton blend)

**This Blend was a christmas gift given to me by my girlfriend's father, and was aged ~3 years. A big thanks to him!**

**Description on Tin**: Flue-curing captures the natural sweetness of the fine Virginia tobaccos in this flavorful blend. Aging in cakes softens them into elegance. This partially rubbed flake hankers back to English days of old. It burns with regal restraint to a mottled white ash. It is a friend with strong character and considerable charm.

**Looks**: Beautiful, red-brown half broken flake. They're not full flakes, but close enough. 

**Tin Aroma**: the standard McClelland ketchup/vinegar. Can't really detect much else.

**Taste**: So awesome. It's like a combination of the subtlety of a yellow virginia with the tang of the more sour varieties. There's some rich grassy notes which are full of flavor. There's an edge of a twang which is reminiscent of sour fruit, with some dry woody flavors to support everything and hold it together. On the finish, there is some slight peppery notes, but I think it's from the curing not perique.

**Room Note:** This is a cologne worthy scent people. probably number 5 on my top 10. Subtle peppery smells  layered with rich cured virginia notes. Excellent.

**Smokeability** : In the tin, it's a wet flake, so it's hard to get burning. Once it goes it goes though. My first bowl lasted an hour and 15 minutes before I put it out because I had to go study for finals. Most bowls are greater than an hour.  It burns so cool, that when I wanted the heat from the bowl to warm my hands, it was as cool as Renholder's on air personality.

**Compare to** : Irish Oak, After Dinner, Red cake.

**Summary**:  This is just an excellent blend. I think of it as a duller version of something like Irish Oak. It's a very harmonious blend, with nothing standing out, and everything blending together softly. It's not overpowering, while not being mild. A well rounded, complex, stable smoke.

**Rating : 4.5 / 5.0**

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak, Samuel Gawith's Full Virginia Flake, and Dunhill's Nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of Virginia and English blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q and Dan's Blue Note. I've been piping for almost 15 months, and smoke frequently. I really enjoy complexity, and shy away from goopy 1-shot blends.

====================================
physicsyakuza: How much do you think the age changed this? Fresh do you think it would it lose that vinegar sourness?

Edit: Also, I don't know much about Ashton blend. Can you tell us anything?
--
DrScience11: I think the vinegar smell will stick regardless. The age probably softened it some, so I would expect the twang to be a little sharper in younger blends.

I don't know anything about the ashton blend except that it was discontinued and in 2010 McClelland revived it.

====================================
None: Very nice review. I wish my palate was as sensitive as yours, I just got a few tobaccos I wish I could harp on. Long story short: Vermont Meat Candy smells like breakfast, tastes like an aro.
--
DrScience11: Oh my, meat candy sounds so interesting. You have to give us your thoughts on that.

None: Like I said, I consider my tobacco review skills rudimentary and my palate to be nowhere near as sensitive as it should be for this type of job, but I can give it a shot! let me get a few more bowls in and I'll post something.
