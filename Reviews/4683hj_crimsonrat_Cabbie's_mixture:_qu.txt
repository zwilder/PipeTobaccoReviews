Cabbie's mixture: quick review
By: crimsonrat

I picked up a few tins of this when it went on sale at smokingpipes, and after watching Shane Ireland's review, I needed to try it. Also, I am a Sam Gawith fanboy.

It comes in the form of shaggy coins. Think Doblone d oro or 3 nuns. I sort of like the presentation, but I prefer my coins to be neat like Escudo. 

Taste: I smoked a bowl of this right after some FVF, so my taste was certainly influenced by this. I didn't taste or smell much of the perique, but it was there in the background. In the tin, the Virginias don't smell too bright, but almost has a stoved quality to them. This translates really well into a good, smooth, light to medium bodied smoke for me. Think smokability like an OGS, but just a tad heavier and sweeter.

Overall, I don't know if I'll be stocking up really heavily, but I will keep a couple of tins lying around.

thesillyoldbear: Give it a bit more drying time for at least one bowl. There's some talc in the background there, and maybe even some chocolate and leather.

Moumar: Cabbies Mixture is one of my favourite tobaccos I've tried so far. Nice middle ground between OGS and VaPer that is heavy on the perique. 

I agree, it would be nice if the coins held together better. The tin I got was like a ribbon cut with a few coins mixed in.

fiatabarth: i ordered 8 tins (you know, to try it out) on release from SP and opened one last night. stuffed full of perfect coins. still needs the gawith drying time, but looked legit. i'll smoke a bowl or two tonight and tomorrow. seems like a nice change of pace from some of the heavier blends i smoke. like an all day kinda smoke. honestly more excited about lakeland dark, cause i'm pretty sure it's bracken shag.

fiatabarth: Just had my first bowl in my little castello full vent Dublin. Small, conical bowl, group 2 ish. It reminds me of the savinelli coins but made with gawith tobacco's. Richer in the VA, lighter in the KY, and a gentle Danish style topping like on strong dark flake by Heinrich. Had it in the morning with coffee. All day kind of smoke for me. Sweet, uncomplicated, has enough legs to keep your attention, but not enough you can't have another bowl after. I'll be ordering more tins, as I bet with a few years that topping and VA will settle in with the KY. Also not high in perique, barely in there. Which is good, as it's the fruity perique, not the super spice. In fact, the spice is more the KY spice (BBQ sauce). 9/10

fiatabarth: Also I rubbed it out. Smoked this bowl moist, next one will be dry. Then I'll probably wrote my own review and not hijack your shit anymore

GanDuff: > I ordered 8 tins (you know, to try it out)

Hahaha!

That sounds lovely. I'll definitely keep it on my "to buy list". Unfortunately, I won't be buying anything soon, not even with IPSD, but eventually I will.

Thanks for the review,    
Cheers
