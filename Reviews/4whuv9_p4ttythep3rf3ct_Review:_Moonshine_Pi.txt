Moonshine Pipes â€“ Devil Anse â€“ Whiskey Blast

TLDR:  http://imgur.com/a/IF2sY
What a nice pipe!  I would be ordering another Shiner collection today had I not had the experience I did with Jonathan on the other thread.  I really wanted to hate it and have it arrive with something wrong so I could lambast it in front of the community, but I canâ€™t.

First impression upon opening the box is that it is bigger than I anticipated.  Which is a good thing.  I had read some reviews suggesting to get ready for a smaller pipe.  I knew the measurements and did the invisible ruler in the air in front of the computer thing, but I was pleasantly surprised nonetheless.

Second surprise was that this pipe has some heft to it.  Nothing crazy, but I suppose since I was expecting smaller, I was imagining something lightish like a cob (not quite, but light).  Iâ€™m glad that did not pan out.  The weight feels great in hand.  Iâ€™m not so sure this pipe is a clencher, however.  The leverage and center of gravity are too far out to be comfortable for a long time.  Or maybe thatâ€™s just me.  I wasnâ€™t looking for a clencher anyway.

Ok.  Obviously the blast work is quality.  This thing looks good, I mean real good.  It has a certain ruggedness that lends itself well to what I assume the vision of this pipe is, or at least, the vision as described in the product description on the website.  Itâ€™s my first blasted pipe and I am pretty pleased about it.  Very well done.

The drilling is almost perfect.  It may even be perfect for the shape, Iâ€™m not sure.  It seems as though it is a hair high, allowing for a tiny divet just below its egress into the bowl, not even the size of a BB.  But I look at the shape, and itâ€™s pretty spot on for how the bowl cants.  I imagine it may be a difficult or uncommon drill.

Overall arbitrary rating of how I feel about this pipe, even after all the BS Iâ€™d say at eight out of ten.  However, my recommendation is to not buy from this company until you see a Buy One Get One sell pop up again.  Also, buyer beware:  The company does not know or seemingly care a lot about modern CSAT practices and should you find yourself on the end needing to communicate with the company for any reason post-purchase you will may find yourself asking yourself why you ever handed money over to such a dickbag, if he even communicates back at all (which honestly would have been better).   Your mileage may, of course, vary.   Happy piping!  â˜º

====================================
soymilkisgood: It's a good pipe because it was made by Briarworks, who put out some of the best serially made pipes today. The pipe speaks to the quality of their manufacturing more than anything. So buying another Briarworks pipe would probably be the correct way to go about acquiring another one. ;)

p4ttythep3rf3ct: Honestly, my next Briarworks purchase is going to be that Calabash.  It was going to be this purchase, but their website thing shuffled it up and I couldn't find the pipe/bowl combo I really wanted elsewhere. This MS purchase was what I settled with to beat the Aug 8 deadline, should that come into play.  I had been eyeballing it for a week or two.  I'm not sure if the deadline even mattered, but it was the excuse I needed :)  Hopefully they'll have their site sorted out by the time I'm ready to drop that amount cash again.

Moonshinepipeco: jesus christ dude.  do you ever quit?

soymilkisgood: Am I supposed to stop telling people the truth at some point? Why don't you tell me.

notmynamebutreally: I got my pipes today as well and I feel like you perfectly summed up my feelings. Thanks for this post!

hicetnunc37: This sub turns everything into a bitching contest , you got 2 for 1, knowing well about sellers reputation. What is the point of posting this? To bash the pipe maker or what?
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: I didn't get two for one at all.  Guess you missed the earlier thread... Nonetheless, it's a solid review of a solid pipe.  He's lucky his work speaks for itself and warranted me even saying anything at all.

EDIT: And I didn't know the seller's reputation.  Who the fuck are you who incorrectly assumes so much?
EDIT2: Sorry I snapped, but you clearly jumped in and ran your mouth off without having a solid background in anything related to my purchase.

hicetnunc37: 

you said everything right here "I really wanted to hate it and have it arrive with something wrong so I could lambast it in front of the community, but I canâ€™t."
stuff like this is not cool. if you are going to do this at least have the decency to let the other side have a say.
I am just a person who enjoys pipes and sometimes I read these post and its not fair to pipe makers or blenders to put them on full blast in front off this community, that's who the fuck I am.

--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: Also, did you read my whole post or did you stop there?  That I wanted to hate the pipe but couldn't is a testament to how good the pipe is.  Like, except for the last paragraph where I touch on the business-side, the whole review is an advert for that company.  I even took sexy pictures, did you check those out at all?  It weird that you thought I did all of that to 'bash the pipe maker or what".

p4ttythep3rf3ct: He had his say, plenty.  This'll catch you up:

Although it appears Jonathan has deleted all his smoking gun comments.  There is a very real reason I have my opinion and it is very valid.
--
givemeyours0ul: I can't believe someone upvoted that guys comment and downvoted yours! It looks like he was responding to carnesy, who had a bad experience, not your original post however.

Edit: Nope I'm wrong. It was directly at you. Well, carry on then.

====================================
Moonshinepipeco: I am happy to hear that you are pleased with your pipe.  I was quite drunk (not an excuse, just a reality) when i posted those "smoking gun" comments.  Im not perfect, and I have my demons just like everyone else in this world.  Enjoy the pipe thought.  any concerns, I'm reachable anytime at 434.422.0992.  nice nail polish by the way 
--
p4ttythep3rf3ct: Lol, thanks.  Biting my nails is one of my lifelong demons.  Well, sticking my fingers nails in my mouth now.  I don't bite any more, but it does consistently ruin my polish.  Shredding guitar takes it off too, but in the end, I don't really GAF.  I'm a bitch like that ;)
