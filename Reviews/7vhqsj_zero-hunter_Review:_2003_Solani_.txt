Review: 2003 Solani 633

====================================
zero-hunter: Figs, chewy fruit snacks, plum, bitter dark chocolate, jam on toast, and lemon on the nose. The flavor is full with sweetgrass, a little bread, pepper, and earth. Although not as creamy or bready as Escudo, this well-aged VaPer has a noticeable dose of nicotine and demonstrates the masterful skills of Solani blenders.

Tdot_Grond: Sounds and looks yum.

Old_Deadhead: I just drooled a little reading this. I guess it's one I need to add to the list. 

Thanks!

gentlytamped: I have one in the cellar myself and definitely will add more. It's a great smoke I'm sure its wonderful with age.
