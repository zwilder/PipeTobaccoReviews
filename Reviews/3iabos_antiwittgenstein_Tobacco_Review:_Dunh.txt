Tobacco Review: Dunhill Elizabethan Mixture
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #48

**Blend Name:** Dunhill Elizabethan Mixture

**Description on Tin:** Dunhill Elizabethan Mixture is one of the standards among Virginia/Perique blends. While the Perique is readily apparent, the real stars are the wonderful Virginias, which are carefully matured under pressure and heat to develop a depth of flavor unlike anything else.
 
**Leaf:** Light and medium brown short ribbon on the thin side. Very dry to the touch right from the tin.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisin, bran muffins, yeasty bread.
 
**Taste:** Sweet-salty-sour-savoury-spicy. Has a bit of a funky edge to it which usually accompanies high red VA blends. Fruit salad. Oranges, honeydew, plums. The spice is a firm medium plus, like white pepper, it doesn’t seem to have a sweetness to it and attacks the tips and sides of the mouth. Tangy. Orange and purple. There is something muddled about this tobacco. It is intentional I believe, a marrying together of disparate elements to the point that their differences can no longer be perceived. This results in the long chase, through doorways and around corners she slides, through kitchens all aclang and across parks lit only by moonlight reflected in the dew. A bit woodsy, cedar-oak I would spell it, the fresh raw stuff that you can shine up to see yourself in between the grain, not the smoke. When it is clear, the sweet-sour tangy, with that roil of spice is perfectly satisfying, but the finish (is that a word I can use here?) is drab, a bit ashy, so that the taste is always fleeting, always being covered over by what comes after. Another solid puff, mouth filling with flavor, blood oranges, plum sauce, fajita seasoning – then just the steady burn of pepper. As I expect by now, goes darker towards the end, char, red wine vinegar, the sweetness doesn’t subside, but it falls below the other flavors. Grows even ashier. And then stops taking the flame.

**Nicotine:** My eyelids are a bit droopy for a Virginia, must have a good kick from the Perique. Call it 2 shots of bourbon.

**Smokability:** Kinda bad for a ribbon this dry. Maybe this is too dry. Takes the flame well, but even with nearly constant tamping it loves to go out on you.
 
**Room Note:** House filling reek of cigarettes. Smoke this one outside.

**Thoughts:** Carter Hall, my last review, did very well I think because of how low my expectations were. Elizabethan Mixture, conversely-wise, suffers from failing to meet my high expectations. I think if I was given this tobacco to review blind, I would haven’t been let down, and could have focused on the positive aspects of the mixture. This is as close as I have gotten to a classic VaPer. There is not the mouth puckering wineyness of Anniversary Kake nor the C&D funk of Bayou Morning. It is Virginia. And Perique. Simple and fairly well done. But with the Dunhill name, the broad shiny tin, I wanted this to transport me. But for a Tuesday night smoke – hey isn’t this Tuesday night? – it is perfect. You can get solid flavors on it, sit here like I did musing over what I get from every puff, or you can read a book, watch tele, study, woodwork, whatehaveyou and never get too distracted by the tobacco. So keep your expectations low, and enjoy this simple smoke.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Anniversay Kake Bayou Morning, AJ’s VaPer, Carter Hall

**Summary:** A simple, straightforward, no frills, tricks, or gimmicks Virginia Perique Blend

carnesy: Check out the review by [STUFF&THINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clbGVGd85OA). I believe he says this is a blend he has smoked a lot of and has found you can consistently pack it right out of the tin and smoke it with no drying time. This may be one of those far and few blends where drying it at all actually deteriorates the quality of the smoke rather than improves it.

arterianSanor: I've been having doubts whether to buy this tobacco or not, but Brad keeps talking about how good the blend is, and this review has convinced me to buy my first Va/Per blend. So, should I jar it immediately?
--
antiwittgenstein: I like how dry it is, but as always, do what you feel.

hbblacksmith: It was my first Vaper, also due to Bradley influence, and right out of the tin was wet as an ocean, and so, not to my liking! I put the ton aside for a week or so, and i can tell the experience was very diferent! I ended liking more than expected, and it opened a all new experience to me! Don't quit on it...
--
antiwittgenstein: Now that you mention it, this *was* super wet when I opened it, but even though I screwed the lid back on tightly, it was crispy dry a few days later.
--
Formaldehydeontoast: I've been musing over the same thing recently, I really want to pick up a tin but I'm unsure whether to go for Elizabethan or St James flake, its been bugging me for a while now. I believe St James is basically full virginia with some perique, which sounds nice, but I cant help but think it would need a little more sweetness than FVF has to offer to balance out the perique?
--
used_fapkins: This has absolutely been my experience. It seems to want to burn absolutely beautiful for me

====================================
None: I love the stuff.

====================================
None: I love EM but I totally agree, the hype defiantly take away from the blend. Very straight forward great blend though.
--
antiwittgenstein: I am gonna jar up most of the tin and see how I like it summer. I like it, but I often find myself reaching past it for something else.
--
====================================
lostcpacket: When I smoked a half of a tin I decided that never again and gave it away. Probably I should have cracked a tin and wait about 2 weeks before smoking. Now I think I could smoke it between tobaccos with more intensive/sweet tastes

antiwittgenstein: Writing these is some of the most fun I have. And I just realized how sad my life is. These are the decisions I have made in my life. Thanks!

tankbuster183: >House filling reek of cigarettes.

I don't know why but this really made me laugh.

I enjoy your reviews, especially the rating system.  In fact, they seem like the kind of ratings you would dream up over a nice bowl.

I always like Dunhill tobaccos (I like the pipes too, but you know, wife/mortgage); they don't always hit my palate the right way, but I feel the quality is always spot on.  Nice review.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks, glad you enjoyed it. I have a couple more still unopened Dunhill tins, Nightcap and London Mixture, which I will probably pop open and review over the colder months. I would like to eventually do the whole Dunhill range, which seems feasible. As opposed to say, McClelland, Sutliff, or C&D.
