I posted an initial first impression review and have finally gotten through the entirety of my first sample so here's my full review of Fuzzy's Coffee Kake by /u/Fuzzy_Totemz

**Blend Name:** Fuzzy's Coffee Kake

**Description on Tin:** Fuzz's Coffee Kake is a VaBurBur that is mostly Burley in plain and Cavendish forms. 

**Leaf:** Nice even brown burley. Little flakes are occasionally lighter/darker but it's uniform through out. 

**Tin Aroma:** Lovely chocolate with a nice hint of coffee and a backbone of burley. 

**Taste:** Pretty much how it smells. Nice smooth chocolate and coffee with a creamy burley. It's more a latte then a coffee.

**Smokability:** It was a little damper than I usually smoke when I first received it but it smokes very nicely despite the dampness. The flavor doesn't diminish with a little drying which does help but is not necessary.

**Room Note:** Pretty much a burley room note. 

**Thoughts:** I must admit I'm not a big aromatic person. Despite that the excitement about the /r/pipetobacco club blends got the better of me so I jumped on the chance to try this blend out. I knew I made the right choice right when I opened the baggy and let that sweet smell wash over me. This blend really is more of a burley/aro combination, along the lines of the english/aro combo that is Frog Mortons Cellar. This blend is really good in the morning. I mean really good in the morning. It goes very nicely with coffee. What I really enjoy about the blend is that it is really good for adding a pinch of other aromatics too. Add a pinch of 1q, there's some creamer, add a pinch of FMC well now it's Irish.

**Recommend to:** Anyone who enjoys a smooth burley blend, if you're like me and have been disappointed by aromatics due to the lack of actual flavor once the aromatic part goes away. 

**Summary:** It's a good morning blend. If you have a chance to get on board the next run then do it.

**Drink Pairings:**  Coffee, Milk.

**Final Rating:** 3.5/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
Fuzzy_Totemz: Thanks crim, I went easy on the coffee flavor in that batch. The next round will go back to my original ratio.  The actual latte blend I am working on should have zero chocolate note but the same burn characteristics. I may even take suggestions on a name for it other than Latte. 
  
My real intent is to give you that rich Burley nutty palate flavor which as most people note, makes a great cup of coffee even better.  On a cold day, the original coffee mix "Fuzzy Joe" I was working with was a great standalone smoke as a "cold day / warm coffee" situation.  
  
I am a big fan of "rotate your smokes" to keep from burning out on any one thing. Carter Hall was an inspiration to me for a "simple honest burley smoke" for the nutty/smooth characteristics and pairing with coffee.  
  
I wanted to preserve that experience with richer blends made with better quality tobacco and produce a coffee-ish room note/retro.
  
Thanks crim!

SupraMario: Nice review. Completely agree with the pairing of drinks and when to smoke it. It's my go to if I have a few minutes in the early morning right before the sun is up and the dew and fog still are lingering.
