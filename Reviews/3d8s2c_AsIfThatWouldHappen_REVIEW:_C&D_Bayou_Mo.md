====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: **REVIEW #14**

**NAME** Bayou Morning Flake (C&D)

**DESCRIPTION ON TIN** A Virginia/Perique lover's delight! We start with Old Belt Red Virginias, add 25% Perique and press the whole lot before slicing into flakes.

**LEAF** Broken flakes, thick and somewhat more broad than most other blends.Medium to dark brown, fairly uniform, with 
red-brown and some light patches spread throughout.

**TIN AROMA** Figgy, stewed fruit comes to mind. A kind of raisin bran and light toast smell is fairly prominent, the perique is noticeable with its tangy spiciness, and the virginias smell
fresh and a little sweet. Definitely a bolder smell with the stoved red VA's as opposed to golden.

**TASTE** From first light it was nice and spicy, took really well to the flame and just kept streaming beautiful white smoke. The Perique here is delicious, it's spicy, tangy, not overpowering but just right for this blend. It is a sharp flavor, but still very smooth in feel, The retrohale was beautiful, warm and spicy, with that fantastic pepper note. The VA's supported the Perique for the first 1/2 to 3/4 of each bowl, adding some sweetness and cutting through the sharpness, and giving the whole smoke some substantial body. Towards the bottom of the bowl the VA's shine, they sweeten up but still remain nice and bold and dark, like a good red wine. The perique doesn't disappear but moves aside a little to give the Virginia it's 15 minutes of fame. Not a terribly complex smoke, but not overly one dimensional either, very reliable and consistent, I do think this would make a great all day smoke if you like a heavier, bolder smoke with
a good nice nicotine kick.It is very approachable. This is coming up in the Community Review soon, but there is also a ready rubbed version that reportedly tastes quite different so experiences may differ for those who take part.
I really enjoyed this blend.

**SMOKEABILITY** Was a little wet in the tin when I opened it, I left the lid off for a day and it was fine after that, I just gravity fed the broken flakes, tapped them down, then packed a little more on top until the draw felt right and it always smoked beautifully. Required very few or no relights, burned slow and cool and never wet, but it likely would be wet straight out of the tin. Made plenty of smoke, all of which was very flavourful,

**SUMMARY** I really enjoyed my time with this blend, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more, but I may try the ready rubbed next out of curiosity. For some people the Perique may be a bit much, or the Stoved Red's may taste a little off if you haven't had them before, but for a smoker with a bit of experience this is
a great blend. Looking forward to the community review to see how the two versions compare in others opinions.

**SCORE** 4/5

hedonaut: Great review, man. An interesting note on the two versions. Typically a ready rubbed has been pressed, cut into flakes, then tumbled out again. The Bayou Morning bulk version is just ribbon cut. There's never been any pressing at all. So the drastic difference between the two smokes has a lot to do with whole leaf being pressed vs being simply sliced into ribbons and mixed. 

In any case, this is, as you can tell, one of my top smokes right now. The toasty noted from stoved Virginias that haven't been sugared all to hell and back is fantastic.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thanks for the feedback and the info. That really does explain the difference between the two doesn't it. Yep, the smell and taste of the Stoved VA's is a nice change of pace for sure.

C-Ray6: Have not had the flake yet. Only the Bulk Ribbon cut. Tried it last week. The tin note of the ribbon cut leaves something to be desired. I swear it is more reminiscent of gym socks. But when I finally lit it up, holy cow! I love this tobacco. Easily my new favorite. Tangy spicy goodness with a very present retro-hale. I enjoy it. Great review.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thanks.
Sounds like it's a decent smoke, I may well order a tin next time I buy. Isn't it great finding a new favourite!
--
C-Ray6: Yeah it is. I had no idea what to expect going into it, not that tin note often expresses into the actual smoking of the baccy (at least for me). I was pleasantly surprised. I will likely  have a bowl after work today.

ijustreadidontpost: Sweet baby jesus, they make this in a flake.  Yum.  Big fan of the ribbon-cut.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: They are reportedly very different, but give it a try and see how you go. Nothing ventured nothing gained hey.
