Tobacco Review: MacBaren Virginia No.1

Review #49

**Blend Name:** MacBaren Virginia No. 1

**Description on Tin:**  This time I am gonna post two:

smokingpipes:
A ready rubbed tobacco, manufactured from a selection of choice, ripe Virginia tobaccos, which gives Mac Baren's Virginia No. 1 a mild, sweet smoke.

P&C:
Mac Baren Virginia No.1 has been a standard among Danish aromatic pipe blends for decades. Ripe and sweet Virginias are flavored with a signature top dressing and pressed, sliced and fully rubbed out to develop a great flavor and amazing aroma.

**Leaf:** Broken leaf. Mostly yellow. Has a bright summery look to it.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Hay, bran flakes, citrus.
 
**Taste:** Lemonade. Homemade lemonade that is sweet but not too sweet. Lemon oil – like when I wash my martini with a lemon peel instead of olive, it has that same intense taste. Salty. Vinegar, very vinegary. A touch of heat there. With that it tastes quite a bit like North Carolina white vinegar barbeque sauce. Rolls back into Lemonade. Has a savoury undercurrent. But mostly lemons.

**Nicotine:** Mild – mild enough to be able to smoke two bowls in a row.

**Smokability:** Lights pretty easily. I have to relight it a few times even after drying for a few hours. And it bites. Not badly and mostly because I like how it tastes too much to give it the proper time to smoke coolly.
 
**Room Note:** Mild and toasty.

**Thoughts:** So I bought this from smokingpipes – which advertises this a straight Virginia. Before buying it I also looked at tobaccoreviews which the reviews there also said it was also a Virginia. But when I smoked this and had that repeated intense lemon flavor I became more and more convinced it has a strong casing or topping. Over at P&C, they bill this as an aromatic and their description says so. Once again we offered the chance to play the game of ‘what is it?’ – does a bit of over the top casing turn this Virginia flake into an aromatic? First of all – it doesn’t matter, it is sweet, tasty and delicious. Second, no, no it doesn’t. I am tempted to throw this in with Type II aromatics – blends like Firedance Flake which are a solid tobacco with a top dressing – but Firedance doesn’t just taste like blackberries, it fills the room with the smell of them. Va No1 smells like tobacco when it is burned – it doesn’t smell like lemons or lemon oil or vinegar. With very few exceptions all tobaccos are cased during processing. So it is naïve to differentiate one set of Virginia blends with minimal adding sugars and flavorings from another with just a bit more.

The other thing, this is a bit young, I think I got it a month or two ago. I can see this transforming beautifully with time. I have the other half my order jarred up and cellared. After a year or two I will pop it open, smoke it, and come back to tell you all how it aged.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Orlik Golden Sliced, Comoy’s Cask No. 4, Drew Estate Gatsby Flake

**Summary:** A mildly cased broken Viriginia Flake with more lemons than Sorrento.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the world of lemons):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Liz Lemon)

(++++) Great (Lemon Tree – Peter Paul and Mary version)

(+++) Very good (Lemon of Troy – The Simpsons, Season 6, Episode 24)

(++) Good (Jack Lemon)

(+) I think like it (Lemon Chicken)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Lemony Snickett)

(-) I think I dislike this (The Lemonheads)

(--)This is not for me (Mike’s Hard Lemonade)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (The Ford Pinto)

(----)This is suffering (Lemon Pith)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Microsoft Vista)
====================================
pluesha: Great review! I'll probably pass on this one since I'm not much of a Virginia guy, but it was a pleasure to read nonetheless.

carnesy: Neither was I till i tried some good vapers and then Sam Gawith Best Brown Flake. Give BBF (or full virginia flake) a shot and you may change your mind.
