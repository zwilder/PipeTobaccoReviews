Russian Makhorka review
By: Dsreven
---
i managed to get myself a pouch of russian makhorka (nicotina rustica grown in russia), and boy oh boy...does it taste good

it just tastes like an old codger blend with a bit more bite and body to it

but the strength?, oh my sweet baby jesus if you smoke a pipe larger than a mini cob filled with it your head will spin

cut: powder, it is esentially cut into the most miniscule flakes its almost like its made of factory floor sweepings

moisture: fossilized mastodon turd, you thought semois was dry?, well this is a few thousand degrees dryer than that

strength: 10/10, make sure you have a good seat when youre smoking it and take your time, otherwise you may fall down

taste: it simply tastes like a codger burley, like five guys, but with some bite to it, as the tobacco is so dry and such a fine cut it burns like a bon fire, other than that its fairly smooth and pleasant

overall: id give it about a 10/10 as it tastes pretty good and is cheap (cheap compared to uk tax price your mileage may vary)

bonus: it is universal tobacco like the old prince albert, so you can smoke it in a pipe or roll it in  cigarette, be warned that if you dont use a filter you need to twist the end youre sucking on shut like a joint, otherwise you will inhale tiny bits of tobacco, which isnt too pleasant, and if you use king size or superking papers you will be close to death from the nicotine or atleast you will feel like it

pics will come later

Ifuckinglovepron: Hmm...  Sounds like a good thing to add to an English blend that has bolt taste but light Nic.

Dsreven: might be hard to blend considering the fine cut but itd be worth a try
