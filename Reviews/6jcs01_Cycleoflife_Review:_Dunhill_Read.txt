**Dunhill Ready Rubbed**

**Tin note:** Fruit and hay mostly. Apricot and peach with a hint of funky rubber underneath. 

**Moisture:** This blend came with plenty of moisture from the tin. I tried drying it both moderately and extensively. It lost some of its fruity aromas with the extensive drying, but the smoking ease was improved. Moderate drying resulted in many relights, but more flavor. 

**Smoke:** I found it hard to get the right cadence for this blend, even with different moisture levels. It wanted to go out or give me tongue bite with no sweet spot in between. The slowest cadence improved flavor and reduce tongue bite, which made the relights worth it. 

**Flavor:** Flavor is strongest during the first third of the bowl. The fruit comes through mildly but the rubbery funk increases and is a nice backdrop. The funk climaxes to a sharp brimstone briefly at the one third mark, and then the flavors subside considerably after that, fading into the nondescript. The star of this show is bright Virginia tending squarely to the hay and slightly citrus side. The rubber funk makes me think some matured, possibly red, Virginia is in this blend. Occasionally a hint of florality and spice shows up suggesting an Oriental component while other times a whiff of nuts and leather is there hinting at Burley. The Oriental and Burley are interwoven masterfully to simply frame and focus the Virginias and keep things on track. They never take the center stage. The result is a seamless Virginia blend that is so smooth it could easily be described as boring by some. It is a hard tobacco to focus on for the purpose of reviewing as the mind tends to wander in the absence of thrilling stimulus. Still, though, I have to say it is a high quality blend and is well made. A very meditative and relaxing smoke. Perhaps best suited to someone studying, or focused on something other than the pipe. 

**Nicotine:** Light

**Aftertaste:** Minimal, high risk of tongue bite. 

**Notes:** I found this blend extremely difficult to review. It was like trying to film a Yeti, or simultaneously measuring the vector and velocity of a subatomic particle. The best experience I had with it was when I listened to the new Roger Water's album for the first time. I listened with headphones on, completely immersed in sound, with this blend quietly puffing away in the pipe. I could easily get lost in the soundscape and never did the tobacco distract from the experience. 

If you like Virginia and you are looking for an all day, low maintenance smoke to accompany your daily toils, this may be a good blend to try. A perfect companion blend for your favorite pastime, it is not demanding. On the other hand, if you want to be wowed by your tobacco and have it be the center of attention, then this will be the wrong blend for you.

linearone: Hey, hey! How funny. I was thinking about you and this review this morning. I'm glad to see the review up. I hope it helps people realize this blend exists as I do find it pleasurable. Definitely doesn't get a lot of air time on here or the net in general. Thanks for doing such a well detailed and thorough review.

Cycleoflife: I was more challenging than I had imagined. Every other review I've done has been about a blend that I *wanted* to review. For some reason or another I found it interesting. This one was very pleasant and tasty but nondescript. I'll work on your next request soon, but I think I need a few free smokes in between to freshen up. Thanks again for the opportunity.
