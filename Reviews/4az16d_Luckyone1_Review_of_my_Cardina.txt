Review of my Cardinal House Large Billiard from Walt Connoy
By: Luckyone1
---
Background: I have only been smoking pipes for just over 2 years and when I approach this please take this review as the opinion of a passionate novice and nothing more. I would also like to disclose that this pipe was purchased at a discounted rate with the agreement that I would post a review about the pipe. I will still attempt to give my best effort at an honest and unbiased review.

Brand: Cardinal House - Walt Cannoy

Shape: The website labeled this pipe a "Large billiard" and I would agree to an extent. The bowl is large but the pipe is a very reasonable size.

Purchase Information: Purchased directly from Walt Cannoy on his website(http://waltcannoy.com/cardinalhousepipes/). The pipes original price was $269

Materials: Briar(unknown origin) with a Cumberland stem. The pipe feels great in the hand, has a lot of beautiful grain and the stem is perfect for me. I am a clencher and it fits perfectly in between my teeth and makes clenching comfortable.

So this review is going to be pretty easy to do and the TL:DR is they are worth the money...for the most part. 

I will start with the negative(s) because I feel like there aren't as many and I could talk about the great things this pipe has all day. Walt's site said that these pipes are not seconds and he has streamlined his process to create great quality pipes that are not considered seconds. My only push back on this is that if I had paid full price for this pipe I would have sent it back without ever lighting it one time. You will see surface "holes" in a few ares of this pipe http://imgur.com/uXCbinj , http://imgur.com/wrpVuoZ , http://imgur.com/clgZUVw , http://imgur.com/fpEao6F. These are the worst of them but there are little pits here and there. Also the stem has a slight discoloration on it http://imgur.com/ou2flJ1 from what I imagine was the staining process of the pipe. If I had paid the $269 for this pipe as soon as I saw these things it would have been a deal breaker. I feel like the price that I got on this makes up for its imperfections and these are the only problems I actually have with this pipe.

Now on to the good stuff. I messaged Walt after receiving this and told him I did not want to review this pipe without smoking 10 or so bowls in it and that is what I did. I smoked the remained of my 5 year old St James Flake in this and have been smoking some aged Navy Flake out of it. I can say that as far as "smoking ergonomics" go this pipe is the best performer I have. A friend of mine once told me that you should smoke a pipe and the pipe should almost be ready to go out and that way you can maintain a cool smoke. This pipe is the only pipe of my 20 or so that I can smoke at a very casual pace and still not have to relight. 

In all of the 9 bowls I have smoked through this thing(which is almost twice the size of my normal bowls) I have only had to relight a few times and that was with the navy flake. Which I tested in a different pipe and it gave me problems there too. I blame myself and the tobacco for that.

It is a beautiful and elegant pipe and smokes very well. I had a stranger walk by me outside my apartment and say "awesome pipe" and while I think they would say that about most of my collection I really feel like the bamboo of this pipe sets it apart. 

I feel like the best part of this pipe is how I have not had a wet, moist, sticky, slick bottom of the bowl. I have been able to smoke this to near ash and when I put in a pipe cleaner they come out dry but with some discoloration only. I don't know how this pipe manages that because every other pipe I have leaves the last 1/6-1/7 of the bowl a goopy mess and I have done nothing different with this pipe. In fact the Navy Flake I tried in my normal go to pipe was unsmokable after the 3/4 mark because of too much liquid despite using pipe cleaners to pull excess moisture out.

All in all I would give this pipe(at the price) a 4.5/5. If you get one Walt does have a great return policy if you are unhappy with the pipe so I would not hesitate if you see one that catches your eye. I would make sure I inspect my next one(which I will get!) to ensure I am happy with the finish quality before I smoke it though.

Happy Smokes!

EDIT: Also I realize I spelled his last name incorrectly in some spots. I apologize Walt!

====================================
thats1hottooth: I certainly found similar pits in my own pipe as well. Fortunately they are not blaringly obvious.

Luckyone1: Yea, for the price I paid it is not a deal breaker. My only kind off putting feeling toward this is that he advertises them as "not seconds" but I don't know if something with these pits in the outside of the pipe is fit to be a "first" or whatever it would be called haha.

GanDuff: Here's something that Todd Johnson said in a recent [interview with Smoking Pipes](https://www.smokingpipes.com/smokingpipesblog/single.cfm/post/todd-johnson-respect-for-the-customer):

"For instance, filling sandpits with superglue. These natural flaws are there, you can seem them (we're talking about pin pricks), and I make no bones about it. I've never seen a flawless pipe ever. I'm putting it all out there â€” I'm not hiding anything. I'm doing it the way that I do it."

jaredccoles: I'll second this. I've seen walt's work, and at the prices he's selling, I think the small flaws are more than fair. Normally with pipes in this price range, you get fills. Really good fills that you can't tell are there, but fills none the less. Walt's just putting it out there for you to see, and I think it's pretty cool. Briar is not plastic, it always has stuff like this, and it's a matter of preference on whether you care to see it or hide it.

forwormsbravepercy: You don't have any beauty shots of the pipe!
