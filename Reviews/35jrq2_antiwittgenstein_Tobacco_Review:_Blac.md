Tobacco Review: Black Irish X
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #34

**Blend Name:** Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. Black Irish X

**Description on Tin:** All Gawith & Hoggarth twist tobacco varieties are manufactured by the same spinning process using dark fired wrapper leaves. The filler is again, predominantly dark fired leaf with the addition of a small percentage of dark air cured Indian leaf. They are therefore strong tobaccos. Black Twist, because the cooking process removes some of the stronger tar and nicotine elements, provides a milder smoke than the brown twist.
 
**Leaf:** Black enough to be on the cover of a Slayer album.

**Tin Aroma:** Burnt rubber, very slight vinegar.

**Taste:** Meat. A well seasoned steak hot off a charcoal grill on a 4th of July BBQ. Worcestershire sauce exact, that mélange of salty-umami-funky flavor. There is a bit of sweetness underneath too that melds with the woodsy element. Like there was some mesquite mixed in with the briquettes. It is mouth watering – I mean that literally, as my mouth filled up with saliva from almost first light. Whether that is due to the tobacco itself or the memory of a hundred tangerine Texas afternoons spent waiting for a slice of barbeque to come sizzling off the grill I cannot tell. There is a bit of spice buried in there, call it a light chipotle rub. About halfway through I can taste the Dark Fired itself, hot and woodsy and warm. The meat flavors are never displaced, only augmented. Entering the end, Lakeland. That will lose it some marks. Not the candle wax of Unscented Brown Flake but the more pleasant potpourri of Grousemoor. It does not quite ruin the bowl, but as it begins to ash up and resist each relight I am happy enough to dump it out.

A subsequent bowl showed more pronounced Grousemoor flavors earlier, which then faded through the middle, resurging at the end. As I knew it was coming it was less unpleasant. The taste is of potpourri and incense. Burnt rubber notes show towards the bowl-end as well. A steady but slight vinegar-sweet Virginia plays throughout the smoke.

**Nicotine:** A new addition to the format, I think it behooves me, especially as I venture into stronger blends, to explicitly remark upon the strength. This one is about as heavy as I have ever had. I feel well and truly stoned. Motion and thought comes slow and my vision has darkened. I did not even finish the half bowl I packed, even giving myself a 15 minute breather and having eaten a heavy meal prior to lighting. I like to quantize these things, so let me say this is a four-bourbon smoke.

**Smokability:** I let this sit under a lamp for half an hour or so before loading. It still felt wet but smoked pretty dry. It balloons when the match is touched, even on the relights so make sure to keep tamping, maybe more regular than you might otherwise.

**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but I felt like I was in the middle of a brisket BBQ. 

**Thoughts:** With close to 40 tobaccos under my belt I have begun to think I have tasted the range of flavors pipe blends offer. Every new blend is but a different variant of Virginia, English, Burley, or aromatic. Black Irish X is something almost entirely new and different. It is a carnivore’s aromatic. I never expected to taste something like this in a pipe tobacco, but I think I am going to have to keep this stuff at hand. This will be filed under the *must try* rubric as its uniqueness demands attention and conversation. Give this to one of your vegan pipe smoking friends whenever they look at your steak with eyes of longing. 

**Similar Tobaccos:** South Texas Brisket. Well charred hamburger cooked over mesquite. More power than Ole Joe Krantz. I suppose Irish Flake might be the only fair company I can think of.

**Summary:** A porterhouse steak for your pipe.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

Thank goodness, a rating system I totally understand.

antiwittgenstein: Of course you do ya nationalist.

====================================
chewsyourownadv: I just looked this stuff up... Oh gods, in addition to all that, there are aromatic versions as well. 

>It is a carnivore’s aromatic.

I... just... fugh. Can't decide whether or not this must be tried. I think I'm landing on a yes.
--
C-Ray6: I just ordered some of the brown irish x. Super excited to try it.
--
ajpl: The answer is always yes. 
--
====================================
Piffyr: Excellent review, sir! Your first impressions matched my own. Other than the heat lamp how did you prepare it? Did you slice thick or thin? Did you rub it out, chop it up, or leave it in coins?
--
antiwittgenstein: It was the pre cut variety - there were a few micro coins left in there. It was still a bit strange to pack, I used the same method which worked for a similar cut tobacco (Sutliff Court of St. James), rolling a loose ball out of the mess and popping it in the pipe.
--
Chuzordie: I would love a coin to try .. wife has the brakes on me ordering any more pipe weed..  even if it were hobbits weed for herself.
--
====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: I have been putting this onto and taking it off my orders for months, this review has convinced me to leave it on there before I proceed to checkout next time.

And why not some brown as well, in for a penny in for a pound ey' old boy.

Great review as usual.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. Like I said, this is a must smoke.
--
====================================
RobertBorden: Are you suggesting that Mrs. McGrath isn't a good song?  Awesome review none the less.
--
====================================
pixeechick: I have some dried out I should get to sooner or later. I've only had a bowl of the stuff so far, and in mixed piping company, so I can't say much of it. I'll have to have some again and get a review together. The semester's been busier than planned and I've become derelict in my duties. 

Thanks for keeping these informative, interesting, and coming. I always wonder what's coming next.
--
antiwittgenstein: Oh snap I guess we should have coordinated another team review, my apologies. 
It was something special, thanks again!
--
pixeechick: Oh no worries on that. I'd probably end up holding you back waiting on me anyhow. Job applications, presentations, three major projects, and then just teaching and taking care of all that is keeping me too busy to do much thinking while piping. I'm hoping the bowl of 1792 that awaits me when I get home tonight will help calm the mind a little. 
--
====================================
Darwin7848: AW you might at some point try the Brown Irish X.   It's much less barbeque-y but still with a redolent aroma and aggressive flavor profile. Beware though.  It is even stronger than the Black nic-wise.  I use half a bowl in a bitty Pete 317 and that is more than enough to lay me out if I puff too enthusiastically.  If nothing else these twists are incredibly cost effective in terms of nic delivery.
--
antiwittgenstein: I thought I had put on my big boy pants after getting through a bowl of Ole Joe Krantz in one sitting. Nope.
--
Darwin7848: If you really have masochistic tendencies you can step up to some Five Brothers.
--
antiwittgenstein: I am nicotine lightweight. I don't know how I ended up smoking these heavy blends, besides my search for new flavors. This one is pushing the limit of the Power/Taste ratio - it is just barely worth the green gills.
--
====================================
DeadEyesOfLondon: This sounds really interesting. I'll have to try some.

Are there any other blends that taste like meat?
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Ten Russians tastes and smells like it has a bit of fried bacon in it, strange, but sooooo right.
--
Piffyr: Bacon, you say? On the list it goes.
