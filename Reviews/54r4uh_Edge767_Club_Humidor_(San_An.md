Club Humidor (San Antonio, TX) "Original" blend review
By: Edge767

When I visited San Antonio two years ago, we stayed at the Menger Hotel and there is a small tobacco shop there called Club Humidor. I stopped in and sampled some of their pipe tobaccos. I asked if they use Lane’s tobaccos to make their blends and I was told that they do. Normally, I just figure, “Well, I have most base Lane’s tobaccos; I don’t need to buy anyone else’s blend,” but I came across one that I fell in love with: Original. I can’t put my finger on it, but whatever they do to blend it is magical. However, I didn’t initially think so.

I purchased some Original as a sort of, “Thanks for taking the time to talk to me” purchase and I figured it would be a tobacco that just sat on a shelf. It smelled really nice, but I didn’t have high hopes for it. Later that day, sitting on a park bench outside the hotel and looking at the Alamo, I smoked a bowl. It was nice, but at the time, I didn’t note anything special about it.

Yet something stuck, and I found myself wanting to smoke it again. At home a few days later, I filled one of my precious Peterson’s with some Original, and smoked it. Again, I found its flavor was very subtle but it was very smooth with no bite. It burned nice and evenly, and I was able to smoke it all the way down to the bottom of the bowl without any special tricks or technique. It was not too heady; the nicotine content wasn’t too high. It was also not too wet, nor was it too dry. In many ways, it was perfect.

Over the next few months, I would smoke it after smoking many other tobaccos and I was always impressed with how much I liked it, how well it smoked, its nice smooth flavor, etc. There's no overwhelming single flavor: not too much vanilla, not too sweet, not too anything; just really very well blended and even. As I neared the end of the 2 oz package, I lamented no longer having any more of this fine tobacco left for me to smoke. San Antonio is at least three hours away, and I didn’t know if they sold online. Their website was more marketing than commerce, so I figured I’d just pick some up the next time I was in San Antonio.

That “Next time” was this weekend. I purchased 16 ounces as well as a holiday blend of theirs called Yuletide. When I got home, I smoked a bowl of the Original: it was everything I remembered and then some. It’s truly an aromatic tobacco fan’s dream: beautiful room note, smooth flavor, no bite, and cool/even burning. There is no overwhelming flavor to overpower the palette. I learned while in the store that they accept orders over the phone. When I run out of this tobacco (and I will!), I will certainly order more from them.

Edge767: Exactly.

As I sit here at my desk in my office, I wish I could smoke some of it right now. I'll have to wait for tonight. :)

SupraMario: Sometimes I wish it was the 30s when pipe smoking at the office was accepted lol
--
Edge767: Or at least the 70's. lol I remember going to my dad's workplace as a kid and seeing ashtrays everywhere and people smoking. I also remember stepping outside for fresh air really meant something back then.
--
SupraMario: Yup lol

drnickfury: Was all this from their location in The Menger hotel? Have you been to any of the other locations around the city, is it true that the one inside The Menger is much better than the others?
--
Edge767: This was at the Menger Hotel location. I haven't been to the others, but the one at the Menger seems to be stocked quite nicely. They had a decent selection of pipes, too.
--
drnickfury: That sounds excellent. Based on your review, I need to stop by there next time I'm downtown so I can give the house blends a try.
--
Edge767: Thanks. I find that while I prefer aromatics, it's hard to find good ones that aren't wet and smoke hot. The Original blend at Club Humidor is really quite nice in all regards. If you like aromatics, I think you'll like it.

drnickfury: Stopped by the Huebner location yesterday and picked up and ounce for sampling purposes. I got to say, you are one hundred percent correct on this one. Original Blend is going into my rotation from now on.
--
Edge767: Thanks! Glad to hear that you enjoyed it, too. I consider it one of my best finds to date.
