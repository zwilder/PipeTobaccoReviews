Tobacco Review: Captain Black Royal
By: gestalt162
---
**Blend Name:** Captain Black Royal  
**Description on Pouch:** aromatic black and golden cavendish, exceptionally mild, delightfully aromatic  
**Leaf:** Ribbon-cut 50-50 mixture of black and brown cavendish ribbons, with a pinch of golden ribbon as well  
**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla and Sugar cookies, with a hint of hay or grass in the background  
**Taste:** Initial light is sweet hay, a sugar-cookie-like sweetness is left on the palate. This continues throughout the bowl. If you smoke it hot, the flavors start tending toward grassy.  
**Smokability:** If allowed to dry a little, takes to a light easily. Stays lit about as well as most other tobaccos- it took about 6-7 relights to get through my MM General, which is a huge bowl. Smoke time is on the short side. Smoke is voluminous, but not thick. Very cool-smoking and mild, you *really* have to push it or smoke a big bowl to get any bite. Light-bodied, with a flavor that doesn't coat your mouth or stick around long after your bowl is empty. No nicotine hit to speak of.  
**Room Note:** Marshmallows and sugar cookies. Among the best room notes I have smelled.  
**Thoughts:** If you're looking for a deep, meditative experience with your pipe, this isn't for you. However, if you're looking for an easy-smoking, low-cost blend without any complexity that will please a room, this is one you should try. I've heard that this blend is very similar to the vaunted Lane 1-Q- I have tried relabeled 1-Q from my B&M, and this this may be even better.

With the holidays coming, the room note on this blend may be a nice accompaniment to an outdoor room filled with friends and family, a plate of cookies, and a glass of egg nog. However, the light body and cool smoke makes it equally well-suited to a summer evening making S'mores around a campfire.

**Recommend to**: New smokers for its smokeability and price, aromatic smokers for its room note and cool, mild nature, and perhaps a VA smoker looking to try an Aromatic or searching for a mild, cool smoke with straightforward uncomplicated flavors and a great room note.  
**Summary:** A mild, cool-smoking aromatic with a plain, sweet taste and excellent vanilla-based room note. A crowd-pleaser. For what it is supposed to be, this gets 4 out of 5 pipes, with 1 pipe off for the lack of taste.  
**My Background:** Pipe smoker for about 1 1/2 years, in the past 6 months have graduated from B&M aromatics to name brand blends. I always enjoy a good English blend, sometimes am in the mood for burley, will reach for the occasional aromatic, and have almost no experience with Virginias.
====================================
jrmax: I like this because it's available, cheap, and consistently pleasant for a beginner (or uncultured smoker such as myself). It's like the Molson Canadian of tobacco.

blenheim45: Good honest review, and I was wondering, since so many people seem to like to take a kick at CB.  I smoked it for years, and enjoyed it... until I was gifted with some plainer (un-flavored) tobaccos, and only smoke a bowl of aro maybe once a month or two.

The only DB blend i draw the line at is the Red,  we are going to hit you over the head with the barrel of cherries we infused into this one, blend.  Never again with the Red.  if I want that type of cherry taste I will buy some children's cough syrup. LOL

Piffyr: I think it has a lot to do with its ready availability. A lot of people seem to think that just because you can pick it up at the grocery store that it's not fit for human consumption. I remember seeing somewhere a guy that said CB Royal was crap but that he smoked 1Q every day and enjoyed it. Now maybe it's my unrefined palate, but I've had both and don't see a mile of difference between the two. CB's not gonna be an epiphany or anything, but it ain't road apples either.

blenheim45: If I were going to fault CB it would be for the amount of the polyglycol it has. I recently bought a small lot of used pipes and there was an open package of CB Gold which felt nice and fresh.  the tax stamp on the package dated from the 1971 issue, so the package dated back no later than the 1980's, when they went to a different type of marking.

Now perhaps someone had re-hydrated it, but i doubt that, as the leather pouch of tobacco with the same group, which had it's tobacco in a plastic baggy inside the zippered and lined pouch was dry as can be.  LOL  You had to learn how to deal with tobacco that wet,... all the time, or you would steam you tongue.

Sku77s: Quick removal from the bag can help to remedy this. 

*Edit or I could be mixing it. I take two pouches carter on captain black in a separate tin.
