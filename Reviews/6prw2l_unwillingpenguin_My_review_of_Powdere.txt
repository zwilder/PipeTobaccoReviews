My review of Powdered Toast Man
By: unwillingpenguin

First impression of the tin/bag note was good smells like fresh franchise toast, Buttery with a hint of cinnamon. Upon lighting it the first thing I noticed was the nice buttered bread flavor the cinnamon note didn't come in till about half way through but lasted for the rest of the bowl. The final third was very nice all the flavors blended together to make a really nice French toast flavor. 

Overall a great smoke with a great flavor. 

Thanks u/coldsolderjoint for the sample. Definitely going to get the ingredients and mix more up for myself
