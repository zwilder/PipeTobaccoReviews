A review- Dunhill Ready Rubbed. Done in the manner of your Weekend Safety Brief

Alright turds, sitkneelbend. You all know how this works, you all know what I am going to say, but since  /u/antiwittgenstein is driving the bus, and we are all licking the windows, you gotta listen in. 

First off, Dunhill Ready Rubbed, you trackin? See, once sailing was not the primary means of employment for many young men, the need for a flake tobacco was diminished (that means not as needed for you junior ranks), but the flavors and textures were familiar and people liked what they had previously, you understand? So Tobacconists would get these dadgum flakes and manually rub them out. Hey! quit your gigglin like school girls back there. Since Dunhill Flake was a popular smoke, you see, it was only natural that tobacconists would make a ready to smoke, rubbed out version. Keep laughin, chuckleheads, we are on your time!

Next, the tin. Once popped you can smell the Virginias, earthy and sweet. Like your mother, right? There are orientals in here, according to Dunhill, but like single, pretty, sane women in 29 Palms, I couldn't sense em. The cut is obviously a flake that's been roughly rubbed out, trackin? Some of the bits are bigger, more like a broken flake, but hey, you just go to town on those right? It packs well, so that's the important thing.

Third, the Char is uneventful. Sweet VA, with a thick smoke. What more do you want? The first third is mostly sweet and smokey, like those ribs the First Sergeant makes when you all don't dick about. Grassy, full flavored, with a hint of something on the background. Second third, well now I can find the orientals. Sweet and sour, tangy, but not overwhelming the VA, which is what half of you will do when you get out. The last third is gritty, like John Wayne, or Johnny Rambo for you pups. The bowl will smoke clean, you trackin? It will burn all the way to the bottom, and with throat punch you with its full flavor at the end if you aren't careful. 

To sum up, Good smoke, burns clean, good flavor, decent nicotine. I give it 4/5, and its in my daily rotation now. Anything else for me? Then I have nothing else for you. IF you get in trouble or need something, utilize your chain of command. If someone calls  /u/antiwittgenstein at 3 am from the dock, head will roll, you trackin? Platoon Sergeants, you have em. Turn to.

aelmer2821: Thanks, if you ever spent time in the Military, this was EVERY FRIDAY lol. Your Leadership would give this brief on how to stay safe over the weekend, and it was typically like this, sarcastic, and blunt.

DeafEcho: I swear I sat through safety briefs that turned my 96 into a 91.

aelmer2821: I swear, we had a 6 hour early release turn into a 4 hour early release for the ball one year.

MrCoolCol: Every Friday - 1625 on the dot!

ThePipeSigh: Fun review. Well done. 

Dunhill Ready Rubbed was an amazing surprise to me. Such a simple smoke, but so delicious. I wish it was sold in bulk.

AdamantFinn: Haha, points for the 29 Palms observation.

mahatma666: This would be amazing if I didn’t know that there are three more people who will repeat it, but somehow take more time to say the same things while we’re all stuck there, waiting for it to finish so we can get back to work...

aelmer2821: That's where I always did the best weekend safety brief: " If you are gonna be dumb, be dumb with a buddy. If you are gonna drink, don't do it alone and don't drive. If you are gonna get laid, wrap it. Any questions ask your Squad leader."
