====================================
soymilkisgood: > As is my way with plugs, I try to peel off horizontally the strata of the tobacco in layers, so that I may then cut it into strips with scissors, finally rubbing the strips into a loose batch to stuff into a pipe.

This guy doesn't know what he's doing. 
--
VonSausage: Wait, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of pressing into cakes?
--
soymilkisgood: Yes. They're supposed to be sliced or cube cut. 
--
givemeyours0ul: He does plainly state he knows he's doing it "wrong"
--
landon9560: I mean I could drink a bottle of whiskey as fast as possible without tasting it, but does that mean you are going to want to read my review on it?
--
givemeyours0ul: I think this is more akin to a whisky review in which you drink it in a full glass of ice, or in a cocktail.  Still "wrong" according to the accepted wisdom.  
I'm about 90% sure that in something i read from Pease he actually recommended smoking jack knife plug in this way at least once to experience the different flavors of the layers. Not everytime, but as an experiment.  
As for the temple bar, how uniform is it in composition? It might not matter that much.
--
soymilkisgood: The point is that he's doing a review. I could smoke a  pipe by sticking it up my butt and puffing it that way, and claim that's the way I like to taste the tobacco. But it doesn't mean what I am doing will give you an accurate sense of how the tobacco tastes. 
--
givemeyours0ul: That is both an unpleasant concept and accurate. I salute you.
--
htonl: Assuming you'd use a fartisan with this technique?
--
landon9560: I have to agree, and I also wonder how in the world the guy was able to post that without being laughed out by the editor, or at least told to change it so he doesnt lose credibility for saying that.

I mean i'm no pro to smoking, and have yet (I emphasize yet, one day I will) to smoke a plug cut, but i'm pretty sure that a plug is a large amount of tobacco leaves layered on one another and pressed, either heated or not. While the "juices" will leak and soak into all of the leaves, the tobacco will still have individuality.

Also according to the comments, we're not the only ones who see a bit of a problem in that way of preparing that type of tobacco.
--
soymilkisgood: I think the editor doesn't really care about the content and/or doesn't read what's being posted. I'd imagine this guy is writing for free or very little, so standards aren't exactly sky high.
