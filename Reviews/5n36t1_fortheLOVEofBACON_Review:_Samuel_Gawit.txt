Review: Samuel Gawith Best Brown Flake

Below is my review after smoking through a tin of this stuff:

Appearance: A light colored blend, hues from blonde to light brown with some dark interspersed. Reminds me of bails of hay especially the frays at the end of the flake.

Tin Note and Moisture: A natural hay and oats smell, with some sweetness like honey or molasses. It's definitely not fragrant or floral. The flake feels rather moist and spongy.

Packing: Rubbed out, it's springy, folded it frays easily. It's a little moist out of the tin so expect some dry time. I wanted to get an even burn so I put it through a few taps in my electric blade grinder and added some strips of the flake to form a base/basket at the bottom. Rubbed, flaked, and ground give different smoking experiences, but only nuanced.

Toasting Light: I get hints of toasted oats and and hay, perhaps grass? There's a hint of fruit/sweetness smell on the few wisps of smoke that come up.

1st 3rd: A very mild toasted oats and bready/doughy taste (think driving by a bakery or freshly made dough). The finish is mildly sweet with fruit/figs. BBF is very easy on the palate. No flavor blasts, but moderate and enjoyable. No spice on the retrohale as I'm accustomed to with the many VaPers I smoke. It's smooth and a nice change of pace. No bite.

2nd 3rd: Fruit and figs up front with the constant oats and bread/dough in the background. Sipping is rewarded with delicious citrus notes. Finish is sweet and lingers, making it easy to keep from puffing away. Room note is pleasant and has a quality tobacco and sweet smell. Although this is a full Virginia, I'm not getting the usual cigarette butt/ash tray smell at all. No bite.

3rd 3rd: Now the flavors have ramped up. I have to fight the urge to puff and increase my cadence because I just want to taste the wonderful blending of the above-described flavors. I'd say here is where it starts to resemble the flavor of FVF. I get a little bite and it tastes a bit ashy towards the end, but I blame it on the rain and moisture outside causing me to relight more than usual.

Nicotine: Mild or medium, but closer to mild.

Overall: I'm in love with this flake. It could easily be in my top 5 desert-island smokes, which is surprising because there isn't much complexity to the flavors. In fact, it's pretty much the same flavors all the way down. But it is very flavorful while at the same time being mellow. Could easily be an indoor, all-day smoke. I'd say if you want to practice your "sipping" technique, give this one a try. You'll be greatly rewarded with sweet and citrus, but not harshly punished with bite.

Rating in the form of Keanu Reeves movies:

5-stars: The Matrix **<---- This one**

4-Stars: Bram Stoker's Dracula

3-Stars: Devils Advocate

2-Stars: Speed (only good because of Sandra Bullock)

1-Star: The Matrix 2 & 3, A Scanner Darkly, 47 Ronin, Wick, etc.

Edit: Formatted the ratings for easier discernment.
====================================
givemeyours0ul: I agreed with everything until the second to last word.

fortheLOVEofBACON: Could easily have been attributed to my mood at the time.

carnesy: Someone kill your dog?
--
givemeyours0ul: That's okay. The key to that movie is to view it as intentional farce. If you pay careful attention to the fight scenes, they are hysterical! Probably funnier then the oil fight in transporter.
--
fortheLOVEofBACON: In that light, I can appreciate it more. I'll have to revisit it sometime soon.

misterzipp0: If our temperatures ever stabilize and I get over my new cold it'll be the first one I open! It was 18 yesterday and now it's 60... Go home winter, you're drunk!
