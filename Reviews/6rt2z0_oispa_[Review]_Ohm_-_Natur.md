[Review] Ohm - Natural
By: oispa

I scored some of this from a sale at a large online pipes and tobacco seller. I figured, why the heck not, and I need to make my minimum for free shipping.

This is one of those blends that is mostly as good as higher-priced alternatives, but less sweetened and more rough around the edges. It's for natural tobacco fans only, in other words.

Like many codger blends and OTCs, this is mostly Burley with some Virginia to sweeten it. It comes relatively dry, and the pouch note is that fresh barn smell with some of the sweetness of the breeze coming over a field of summer grass. It lights easily, and should be packed somewhat tightly, but quickly blazes with an onslaught of the warm Burley flavor that most compare to nuttiness but I think tastes like roasted oats. At that point, the flavor of new wheat and honey from the Virginia infiltrates, and the warm Burley flavor becomes gentle with notes of caramel. The second half of the bowl makes the flavors combine entirely into something like honeyed oats, and it burns evenly down to a fine grey ash. This one is medium nicotine with maybe a little extra.

I could smoke this all day. Even more, it is a great backdrop if you have just a pinch of another blend that you love, because it picks up and amplifies those flavors. For $12 a pound, this is quite a good deal, and even experienced smokers can enjoy it.

Other than me that is.

TheNutPair: Glad you enjoyed it!  I'm pretty certain that's cigarette tobacco cut differently to dodge the RYO tax.
--
oispa: It may be, although there are some of these low-cost tobaccos which are designed as multifunction, meaning you can pipe it or roll it. Five Brothers is sort of the archetype for those, and while I don't like their blends, Daughters and Ryan makes quite a few of this nature.
--
TheNutPair: Yep I remember when I used to smoke the occasional RYO. I bought the DnR a few times. Then when that crazy law passed and everything became pipe cut I just gave up. It's better to not smoke cigs anyways. 
--
oispa: I couldn't go back to cigs at this point. I'd be thinking how much I would rather be smoking a pipe!
--
TheNutPair: Oh absolutely. Those things are disgusting. Glad I'm off of them too. 
--
oispa: Good point. I do not miss the smell of high-temperature burnt tobacco, nor having gunk in my lungs. With a pipe, one smokes, then if necessary rinses and spits. No gunk.
