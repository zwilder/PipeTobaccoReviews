A sleepy review of Mcclelland Pebblecut

Mcclelland pebblecut 
Tin number 530114.

It's been in my possession for about 8 months, smoked in a lepeltier clay and lit with wooden matches and coffee stir sticks


--

A fascinating, vinegar and bright, almost Citric (sour apple) aroma at opening, with underlying bread and savory notes. Tangy and nutty. 

Thick broken flakes. More ripped than rubbed. Looks like beef jerky.

I know I should wait after opening to try it but I must sample, lepeltier clay in hand!

Very bright smell, reminds me of good apple cider vinegar with something sweet. Balsamic vinegar and fruit maybe

---
Upon lighting it is sweet! Fruity with an almost floral undertone. Reminds me In a weird but good way of the smell of blankets out of the dryer.

Surprising wisps of coconut

The Perique is peppery and nice.

And a sudden and disappearing note of hazelnut
Some syrupy sweetness following

---

Starting to feel the nicotine now. Pleasant relaxation.

I'm having a hard time keeping the second half lit, but that could probably be explained by the fact that I'm a new smoker, unaccustomed to flake tobaccos, bad at packing, and smoking in a Floridian swamp as it rains .

The second half, for me, and contrary to other reviews, was less flavorful. Perhaps due to its difficulty burning. I didn't get nearly so many clean notes out of it, but it was tasty.

Holy moly, fascinating blend indeed. I'll be picking up a few more tins. Sweet and ever changing, and, to my knowledge, not cased or flavored at all. 

I'm excited to try this in briar, corn cobs, meerschaum, stone, and in a calabash chambered pipe to see what happens. It's a curious creature indeed!

SwampGentleman: My pleasure! It's a weird one, and I'm looking forward to more bowls!
--
PopnCrunch: ooh, ooh, this IS nice!  I'm having my first bowl now, it's keeping my on my toes trying to identify the flavors!  If Willy Wonka made pipe tobacco, this would be one of them.
