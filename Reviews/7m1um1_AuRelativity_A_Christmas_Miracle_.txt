A Christmas Miracle - A review of a surprise tobacco
By: AuRelativity

I had some initial hesitance smoking this blend. It has a strong stand-out-ish odor which is heavy on smoke and dank earth?

It has a lovely consistency, well-ground with some small nuggety flakes which are fun to rub out and do so easily.

Tamped and lit well, with the first notes of smoke being inoffensive.

It lit well and took a good char without expanding much, not needing any tamping. It lit easily and came out with a pleasant wood smoke sort of taste. It opened up into a strong flavor that as gentle and enjoyable to smoke.

I really liked it at this point. After a little while longer I was rewarded with a luscious flavor like cream vanilla with some dark notes layered in. I stopped to gush about the wonder and majesty of the Creator to make such a tobacco as this.

I can say without exaggeration this truly the finest smoke and experience I have had the pleasure of enjoying..

and the envelope says:

Seattle Pipe Club: Plum Pudding.

I lead a far better life than I deserve.

What a treat! I had wanted to try this and it far out-shone what I imagined it to be. I can see why it is a widespread favorite.

Merry Christmas, indeed.

Tis-a-FleshWound: I think it's nice to smoke something blind, without any expectations, so you can get your true opinion for the blend. I think there are many people that if you sent them blind tobacco samples their opinions might change some.
