Drew Estate Meat Pie...why should you give it a try? A humble and hopefully humorous review.

It's true that [Meat Pie](http://i.imgur.com/2q7flrS.jpg) by Drew Estate is nothing as novel or remarkable as a 3D printer...definitely not as pleasurable as sex...and you may have tasted a better English tobacco.  So, why in the world would I ask you to try this seemingly unremarkable blend?  I'll give you my honest review, but I'm not going to give you a 1-10 rating system.  My tastes differ from yours and, thus, it renders the numbers completely worthless and arbitrary.

Firstly, I would like to commend how this tobacco burns.  I paid no special attention to packing this tobacco, and after the initial charring burn and re-pack and re-light...I didn't need to touch it with my lighter at all for the rest of the smoke.  A pleasant 'dafuq' escaped my lips as I am not an overly seasoned smoker, but I can tell the difference between Latakia and Virginia :P.  The burn was even all the way to the bottom, and tamping occasionally was satisfying in the sense that it didn't feel like I was packing concrete.  The smoke was the perfect temperature, it wasn't so cool that I thought I was chewing an Altoid, and it wasn't so hot that I thought I was inhaling a ghost pepper.  Imagine a fresh cup of hot chocolate with some whipped cream on top that had cooled for a minute.  In fact, puffing on it lightly or heavily didn't change its temperature.  My conclusion on how to smoke it, as log as you aren't hooking the mouthpiece up to the air intake of a formula 1 car, you won't turn the tobacco into lava.  It was everything I could have wanted in a smoking experience on a strictly incendiary level.

The complexity of the flavor of Meat Pie is about as complex as a preschooler drawing.  You may not see whatever the fuck that kid was trying to draw, but in the end, it's just that kid and his parents holding hands on a hill underneath a tree on a sunny day.  The beginning of the bowl is mild.  So very, very mild.  In fact, for you English-lovers, you may be tempted to throw a small hickory twig and some pepper in your bowl to add that "kick" you so very, very want from a latakia blend.  On a scale of 1 to Nightcap, this tobacco is around .9 AT THE BEGINNING.  I'll get to the pre-dottle burn at the end of this review, trust me...WORTH IT.  Anyway, as far as English blends go, Meat Pie is turning out to be pretty mild.  Personally, I really like that.  Even though I like the taste of English blends, I'd rather not be sent to the moon on the fuel of the flavor.  Like I said, I really enjoy how mild it is, but to the addict craving for that next English fix...you might be disappointed.  I recommend exhaling through the nose, it completes the feeling.  You know the difference between a meh orgasm, and the one that tingles up through your toes and sends electric shocks through your entire pelvic region?  Well, breathing through your nose isn't THAT incredible, but it adds  icing to the cake.

Room note: Holy fuck.  In a good way.  To me, burning English tobacco is within the realms of snorting exhaust while snacking on baby shit.  The room note on Meat Pie is EXCEEDINGLY mild, even when burning through the more flavorful pre-dottle.  FINALLY, an English that I can smoke around...dare I say it...NON SMOKERS.  Seriously, the room note is something you have to smell for yourself before you think I'm lying.  Although I may be exaggerating my pleasant experience a little bit for the lolz of you guys, I'm serious when I say that this is an English worth trying if only for the novelty of enjoying it around others and not being chased away via pitchforks.

Smoke production is adequate.  It is thick, but not voluminous.  Nothing too special here, a very white smoke.  Yada yada.

Nicotine hit is along the lines of an average burley blend.  It won't knock you on your ass, but you'll feel it.

And finally, the climax of this tobacco.  The bottom-bowl homestretch.  I am going to be modest about this part because I want you to discover it for yourself, but trust me...it's good.  The peppery latakia finally takes center-stage as you would expect and desire, and some other flavor notes come to play that you wouldn't expect.  A slightly nutty and fruity undertone comes in along with a very subtle, yet appropriate coffee taste, and it is wonderful.

Final analysis:  This blend is unremarkable and even mild until the end, where it becomes fantastically flavorful and unique as compared to other Englishes.  The mild room-note even when burning through the full-flavored home-stretch makes this tobacco a worthwhile blend.  You don't have to cater this blend like a newborn, it will take care of itself, and in return, take care of you.  The fact that you can puff on this sucker at YOUR pace versus having to worry about charring and burning your brain through your eyes is refreshing, at least to me.  This English blend would be good for an all-day smoke that won't offend many.  It isn't spectacular enough for me to save for a rainy day or a celebration, but it is good enough for me to write 5,053 character revew.

EDIT:  If you like the review, let me know!  I'll do some more with the same kind of humor if you guys like it, if there is anything specific that you wish for me to add for this or future reviews in terms of specs, let me know!

OhSoHoppy: Great review! Good humor and nice detail. Definitely looking forward to more. 

I felt a similar way about Meat Pie. It was great because it wasn't overly remarkable, but rather a solid smoke for what it is. Sometimes simple is all you need.

jarvis400: Very nice review, thanks!

(Just one tiny thing. Stating something like "this is humorous", stifles some of the humor for me. People will either get the humor or don't. )
