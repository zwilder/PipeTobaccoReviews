Seattle Pipe Club - Deception Pass

====================================
Wookie_Salsa: **Blend Name**: Deception Pass


**Description on Tin**: On north Puget Sound tidal waters flow dangerous & quick under a high trestle bridge. Master Blender Joe Lankford retreats here to reflect.
Joe's NW style Virginia Perique gives the pipesmoker a sense of how we savor our marvelous region. Enjoy English style Virginias, Acadian Perique, Black Virginia, Black Cavendish and a touch of rare Turkish Orientals. Crafting the most sought after small batch blends in America since 2007


**Leaf**: Simple ribbon cut. This makes for a very easy prep and pack, as well as staying beginner friendly.


**Tin Aroma**: We have an unbelievable balance of sweet and smokey aroma coming from the tin. It does sting a little upon the first few inhales. It isn't necessarily a bad sting, but one that sorta hints at the flavor. It reminds me of catching a whiff of Buffalo Wings when the waitress brings a fresh batch to your table. But like scotch, you just need to keep sniffing past the initial burn. It carries a faint hint of McClelland Virginias. However, the perique I believe is what is giving this tin arome its true character. This is one of the most complex aromas I have smelled in my short pipe smoking career.


**Taste**: Sweetness is the first thing I notice upon lighting and getting the bowl to a manageable heat. The sweetness is soon accompanied by a tang, and I mean a BBQ, vinegar tang. Meanwhile, every single puff has quiet hint of spice hitting you that, while subtle, edges the other flavors forward. Its nothing thats going to make you shit yourself, or pound your chest in efforts to extort dominance over your horizon. Its just simply there. Its refreshing, its exciting, and its delicious.


**Smokability**: My tin arrived in a perfect smoking moisture... But I dried it anyways. Left on a napkin for 30 minutes to an hour, and you're left with ribbons that are dry but not snapping or crumbling with pressure. I personally still like having just a tad bit of moisture in my ribbons, I find the tiny amount of moisture helps with packing and keeping the strands closer together. Maybe it leads to an extra char & tamp session in the beginning, but right after that it stays lit forever. The tobacco burns relatively cool, which definitely helps bring out the many flavors in this blend. To be honest, even when smoked a little hotter than I'd like I'm still pulling amazing flavor out of this blend.


**Room Note**: Shit, I don't really know friends. I smoke outdoors in Georgia, so the wind mostly carries the smoke away before I have a chance to smell it.


**Thoughts**: Seattle Pipe Club knocked it out of the park with this one. Not very many people have said much about the blend online so far, but the people who have spoken out have all said they love it.


**Recommend to**: Anyone really, you're not hunting for notes or tastes with this blend. They're very obviously in the forefront. Although, I believe that the blend of many tobaccos in here does contribute to a rather complex flavor, its not one thats going to push away newcomers and crown the experienced pipesmoker with a refined palette that only comes with 14 years of blood, sweat, and tears.


**Summary**: There really wasn't any reviews on the internet about this blend yet (besides tobaccoreviews.com), so I thought I'd provide an opinion for our community here. I hope this has pushed some people thinking about it to actually go ahead and buy it.


**My Background**: I've been pipe smoking for about 6 months now I believe. I smoke about 1 bowl a day, sometimes more. I've been on a recent Va/Per craze, as well as sneaking in the occasional Virginia flake to balance out the redundancy. I'm into coffee and scotch too, and I find it very fun to try to pick out the subtle notes in food/beverages/smokes. I also play blues guitar (had to say it).


*Thank you to anyone who read, and for any and all upvotes. I hope to do more reviews with a different template, and see how that goes.*


Happy St.Patrick's Day to you all!

blizz79: Interesting review.  I just bought a tin of Deception Pass.  I've been waiting to read a review.  I had the same exsperiance with the tin aroma.  I would not describe the taste the way you chose to.  I'm new to pipe smoking so maybe my taste is off. I was hoping reading a review would help me put a finger on taste.  I might have described it as creamy, but picked up no tang.   I enjoyed Deception Pass.  

This is not a critique of your review, I find it interesting that two folks can get something different out of the same exsperiance.  I'll have to keep your review in mind the next time I smoke it, to see if I can pickup any of those notes. Thanks for sharing.

Wookie_Salsa: Everything in pipe smoking is subjective anyways. The most important thing is whether you like it or not anyways. I'm happy you liked the review, and thank you for reading it through.
