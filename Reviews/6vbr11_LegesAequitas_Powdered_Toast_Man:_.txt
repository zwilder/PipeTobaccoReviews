Powdered Toast Man: A Review
By: LegesAequitas

Blend Name: Powdered Toast Man

Bag Description: A series of late night texts and casual, innocent experimentation between /u/coldsolderjoint and /u/linearone led to the birth of a unique and unrivaled experience for your mouth. Buttery Cinnamon French Toast with a little kick. Make it cheap and easily replicable.

Leaf: 
2 parts Lane Buttered Rum,
2 parts Stokkebye Cinnamon,
1 part Prince Albert,
1 part Stokkebye Perique

Tin Aroma: It came in a nifty bag with stickers on it. It smells like a sweet, cased aromatic. I smell more of the buttered rum than anything else. Pleasant. Not cloying like the smell of Molto Dolce in the tin.

Taste: This blend doesn't open up right away, as I don't think most blends do. There is very subtle sweetness that I can't really pin down on any one of the components. As the tobacco burns down the sweetness remains present, but I'm more struck by the how much this tastes like bread. A very yeasty sweetness, wholesome mouth feel along with a little tang. I usually drink coffee or tea when smoking, but I think this would pair really well with a hefeweizen and a peanut butter sandwich. As the bowl gets nearer to the end I start to notice the burley and perique more. I get this licorice/anise spice that I taste from burley forward blends. Overall, the blend is nuanced for an aromatic and quite palatable.

Smokability: I used a cob for this blend. The first time I packed it too tight and it didn't impress. Afterward I used the Irish method exclusively and it then smoked like a dream. I've gone through one of the two bags of it so far. I had the best results from light lighting, tamping often, and smoking it slowly. Almost never any dottle left. Sometimes I got ash in my mouth because I liked the end of the bowl too much. 

Room Note: Never smoked indoors. But I would imagine it's sweet and nice.

Thoughts: It's tasty. It's not fussy. Two great members of the /r/PipeTobacco community put this together and you should give it a spin. I'll be blending some more after I'm all out most likely. Or, if you don't want it, feel free to send me yours!

Rating: 4/5

My Background: I've been smoking a pipe for about four years or so. I like any blend, as long as it's good. I gravitate toward English and Virginias most of the time. Some favorites are: Gaslight, Plum Pudding, Dark Star, Dunhill Flake, and Molto Dolce.

butaud: What's the Irish method? It's not listed by that name in the sub's [packing technique wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/wiki/packingtechniques).
--
LegesAequitas: Good question! It's the method used by J.J. Fox which is one of the videos listed. It's where you swirl the pipe over loose tobacco in your palm. It provides a very consistent and somewhat loose pack, it's my preference for ribbon or shag cuts.

Edit: I noticed the video wasn't available from the current link. Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XHYPso7TXs

butaud: Really interesting, I had no idea something like that would work. Seems like it would probably only work well with a light, springy ribbon cut?
--
LegesAequitas: It works well with any ribbon cut I've tried. I've even had great success with rubbed out flakes. Your mileage may vary on cut up cakes and plugs, but I've had decent results there too. Practice makes perfect.
--
None: Just tried this for the first time and I really like it! Much less fussing around. Gauging the right amount of pressure to use with your hand is a little tricky otherwise it all comes falling back out but I'm barely having to light this pipe at all. Thanks!
--
LegesAequitas: Marvelous, isn't it? With proper tamping I usually have no relights at all. Glad the method helped!
--
SinisterBilbo: I would also like to know this method. 
--
LegesAequitas: It's a great one, especially if you tend to pack to tightly like I am apt to do. See below for my response to /u/butaud.

analogy_4_anything: I keep seeing all this stuff for Powered Toast Man and have been intrigued to try it. How does one acquire some?
--
LegesAequitas: Ask /u/coldsolderjoint or /u/linearone. They are the masterminds and blenders. I believe it's now being sold. Or you can blend it yourself, as per an old post on the matter: https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/6mqbn0/powdered_toast_man_a_reddit_blend_recipe/

analogy_4_anything: Awesome thank you my friend!
