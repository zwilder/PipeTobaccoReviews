Tobacco Review: Hearth and Home WhiteKnight

Review # 98

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home WhiteKnight
 
**Description on Tin:** WhiteKnight is a medium-bodied, very complex and well balanced Balkan-Style blend created to evoke memories of one of the most iconic pipe tobaccos ever made.

**Leaf:** Brown and black mélange in tin-hockey puck kake form. It is pretty dry right out of the tin.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Wood smoke, bbq brisket, Carolina vinegar sauce, petrichor

**Age when smoked:** About a year

**Taste:** Balkan weirdness. Nutty and earthy. Distinct savoury flavors, predominantly garlic and onions. Vinegar tang, with no citrus edge to it. Salty and mildly sweet. Evenly balanced between the flavours. Soapy Latakia comes up with a hint of smoke. Smoke builds, turns more woodsy, less soapy. Oh, hello old friend – this is the lat used in 10 to Midnight and possible Cereberus, some of my favorite Russ creations. Oaky, smoky, and less soapy than what many other blenders procure. After making an entrance, the smoke fades into the mix. Strawberries? I thought it was just an off puff, but it comes again, just light, fresh strawberries. Vinegar turns to lemon, complimenting the strawberry flavor. About halfway through hits its stride, where all the elements fuse, held together by the nutty back bone. Has a decently long middle smoke at this gelled state, with the tangy goodness and fruity sweetness playing off the wood smoke and kitchen funk, but mellowed and muted by nutty earth. As it fades towards dottle the bright parts come off leaving more of the normal English profile.

**Nicotine:** 3, about average for Balkan

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Dry enough to pack from the tin, though lights a bit better with a few minutes of drying. Expands comically at first char so you have to tamp aggressively if you tend to pack light, like I do.
 
**Side Stream:** Nutty, a touch of incense

**Thoughts:** My future father in law was a former pipe smoker, who still has a bowl a few times a year. When he found out I was a smoker he asked me what I smoke – everything was my answer. He said he was a big fan Balkan Sobraine, a nice mellow smoke. Mellow? I had reviewed the current Balkan Sobraine a few years back and found it to be, well not particularly mellow. Supposedly this White Knight is the closest thing, old heads tell me, you can get to the classic Balkan Sobraine. From the future father in law’s description, this might be closer to the mark, with the nutty-earth constantly playing down some of the more unhinged flavors, with a bigger latakia presence as well compared to many of the Balkans I know and love.

Its mellowed, balance nature might make this a good introduction to the genre to a skeptical convert. For a smoker that might enjoy some of the more intense English blends, this would be an easier step up in flavor profile. It also puts it closer towards being a possible daily smoker, but it is still a bit too much for me to do pretty much anything but taste the smoke.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Balkan Sobraine, Balkan Sasieni, Bosophorous Cruise, Luxury Balkan 957
 
**Summary:** A more mellow but still complex Balkan experience

**My Background** I have been regular cigar smoker about 5 years, and entered the world of pipes about 4 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
ITthisIsBen: That was a very well written and entertaining review! I absolutely want to try white knight now.

====================================
Manny1192: Super review. I'll have to pick one up when I get the chance. Also, curling a +5 and hockey a +1?
--
freepancakesforall: Once every four years, absolutely.
--
Manny1192: I will say the mixed doubles are pretty fun to watch. And quick too 
--
antiwittgenstein: This one is super subjective, I know people whose list is exactly the opposite. Well, maybe not the commercials. As pancakes said, you don't get lots of curling coverage, but Hockey is always there. I watched some of the women's game last night and while it was thrilling, it didn't have that feeling of excitement and confusion I get when I watch a weird sport I am not sure I will ever 100% understand.
--
Manny1192: Hey man I'm watching the mixed doubles and it's fucking hilarious and good.
--
Manny1192: Im watching Russia vs Norway for bronze. I honestly don't know how the Suisse are going to contend against Canada. They were awful in the semi's
--
antiwittgenstein: I just turned it on myself. I love how relaxing this sport is to watch. Not like the heart attack machine which is football.
--
Manny1192: I watch both football's, I know soccer is looked down upon but I've been so immersed in it as a summer sport to counter playing hockey so it's a pretty big deal to me. I'm actually not allowed to watch it during the baby's nap because I'll likely yell at the tv and throw something. It's kinda my passion haha
--
Manny1192: Man them Russians are intense! I've had to turn the volume down like 4 times haha
--
antiwittgenstein: When the Russian woman throws her stone her eyes have this terrifying, violent intensity, like she is slowly pushing in a bomb into the house of the men who who killed her family and burned her village.
--
Manny1192: They earned that bronze that's for sure. Ya, she was terrifying. They're married so he's likely used to getting yelled at that much
--
====================================
VilaFrancaWeimar: Fantastic review as always. It really seems like my type of blend, and the fact that it is Russ Oulette's version of the classic Balkan Sobranie makes it extra special!
--
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Always love your reviews.
