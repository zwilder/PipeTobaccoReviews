Review # 82

**Blend Name:** Briarworks Bacon Old Fashioned
 
**Description on Tin:** BriarWorks International's Bacon Old Fashioned's combination of bourbon, citrus and smoky Dark Fired make it perfect for sippin'. Drink responsibly.

**Leaf:** Standard mottled brown ribbon, maybe a bit stiffer than typical. Rather moist in the jar, but dries quite quickly.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Fruits, like apples. Moldy oranges. 

**Taste:** Dark fired. Smoky and spicy. A little sweet. A bit of nuttiness undereneath with a weird kind of mustiness. The hints of apples, really to be exact red apple peels that was in the tin note, comes through faintly. The rain. It tastes like the rain smells, the loam coming up when it has been dry all summer and it finally starts to drizzle. Romantic, but not really super pleasant. Then the dark fired takes over. I mean really takes over, it is all I taste until I get bored of it; a little too hot, smoky and monotone for my tastes, I don’t finish the bowl.

This blend needs two reviews. I tried again and this was my experience. This bowl I packed directly from the jar into my pipe, then waited 10-15 minutes before lighting up.

Peppery and fruity. There is a little heat from the perique, but it is that nice bright variety and not so spicy that it is unpleasant. Apple peels again, and some more fresh apple. It is quite akin to the apple flavor in Drew Estate Harvest on the Hudson, but maybe more red apple than green. There is a little touch of smoke from the Dark Fired, but it is very restrained compared to the previous write up. It takes pauses on a gentle burley. I notice this bowl a vague sweetness, and something that might be a boozy topping. There are one are two puffs that brings it all together, fruit, sweetness, and smoke, that brings the silly name home. At the end it eases back into a gentle burley-spice-sugary goodness.

**Nicotine:** 5. Surprisingly heavy. I have smoked this on numerous occasions and I am always taken aback with how much stronger it is than I remember, even though I remind myself to eat well beforehand because of how strong I remember it.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Smokes well even when it is a bit moist. Has a weird springiness to it that is hard to pack for – too hard and the draw suffers, too light and it goes out whenever it likes. Use a medium pack and tamp more aggressively than usual.

On the second review I did a two pinch rather than 3 pinch pack and it smoked phenomenal. I still had to tamp move often and harder than my wont, but I didn’t have a single relight which is rare for me.
 
**Room Note:** I was bad and smoked inside while we were having temps in the single digits (F). Smoky with a pleasant toastiness. Fine for smokers and understanding SOs, bad for bat mitzvahs. 

**Thoughts:** There are two different kinds of blends that earn the *meh* rating, +/-, those that are inoffensive but don’t quite make it good enough to keep it in my cellar or rotation. Light aromatics, unaged Virginia, or plain burley blends are the blends that come to mind. Then there are the wildcards, the blends that can be bad one day, good the next. Bacon Old Fashioned is the epitome of this second variety of +/- blend. It is fickle. There is an inconsistency of the mixture that makes each bowl a mystery. It is also extremely dependent upon moisture level. I usually like to overdry most anything I smoke. This ruined the blend. I smoked it wet right out of the jar. This was unpleasant as well. The sweet spot is around 5-20 minutes, and I imagine it is even narrow a window than that. Mind you, this is winter here and the heaters are going all out. In the summer or in a more humid clime you would probably need more time, but have a wider temporal range of drying times that would hit this blend’s sweet spot, and it has one.

When, on those few, accidental occasions, when I manage to pinch, and dry, and pack, and puff this little devil just right – oh and in the right bowl, which I recommend wider and shallower – it lives up to the promise of its name. But honestly I’d rather just drink an old fashioned .
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** This one is pretty off by itself in my experience. I said the apples reminded me Harvest on the Hudson. The whisky sweetness on burley recalled Borkum Riff Whisky to me. The Dark Fired naturally made me think about Newminster Superior Round Slices, MM Country Gentleman, and Savinelli Dublone D’oro. 
 
**Summary:** A fickle blend that can be as good as its name or an unbalanced train wreck.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:** +/-

Rating system (interpreted through the filter of someone with Flat Aspect variant schizophrenia, i.e. literally):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (I can’t stop thinking about and craving this tobacco no matter how long ago I smoked it. I fantasize about our life together. I might be literally in love with this blend.)

(++++) Great (I will be thinking about this smoke for the next day or two and use it as a benchmark for other blends)

(+++) Very good (I am impressed and get bummed when the bowl finishes)

(++) Good (I can recommend this without reservations but I am not going to start hoarding it)

(+) I think like it (This is just barely a positive experience but I am not convinced)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Meh. Either I am indifferent to it or it has balancing bad and good qualities)

(-) I think I dislike this (There was something mildly off-putting about this. I am not going to throw it away but I will hesitate to smoke it again.)

(--)This is not for me (It is most likely quality leaf but mixed, topped, or cased in something that isn’t my personal taste, but that I could see how many people might like something like this, or think the bite or burley mouth may be worth it.)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (This is clearly bad. This is low quality tobacco, bad casing, bad mixing, or just a bad batch.)

(----)This is suffering (I am going to throw or give this away, but not to anyone I like. I am not going to smoke my pipe for a few days while the memory lingers. I am going to have to salt’n’booze treat my pipe afterwards.)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (This is most likely a Lakeland. I will briefly consider giving up pipe smoking forever so that I don’t chance having this sensory experience again.)
====================================
givemeyours0ul: This was a -- for me.
--
carnesy: So a + then?
--
givemeyours0ul: Exactly.
--
antiwittgenstein: Several of the smokes I had were --, or even ---, but some hit ++, or +++. It is so finicky, and definitely not for all palates.
--
givemeyours0ul: Before I totally give up I'm thinking about dumping it into a bowl and mixing it a bunch, make it more homogeneous. I think at the moment I just don't like DK.
--
====================================
Doc_Hooligan: I tried some that I received as a sample from the pipe show and I just couldn't finish it. Made it about halfway through the bowl and decided to stop torturing myself. Definitely not a fan of this one.
