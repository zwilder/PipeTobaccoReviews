Sam Gawith: Celtic Talisman
By: pixeechick
---
**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith Celtic Talisman

**Description on Tin:** Celtic Talisman is blended from Bright Virginias, Burley and Black Cavendish. Topped with a dash of sweet cherry, this blend re-defines the "Aromatic'.

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish  Burley  Virginia, Ribbon Cut. Mostly tan and black leaf.

**Tin Aroma:** Cherry, Vanilla

**Taste:** Cherry, Slight Burley nuttiness, sweetness from the Virginias. The flavouring is very, very mild and takes a slow smoke to draw out. Smoke it too quickly and you’ll miss it entirely.

**Smokability:** Burns very dry, and not too quickly. A moderate, cool smoke. In my cob it went out occasionally, but mostly a side effect of trying to smoke slow enough to draw out the cherry flavour. Smoke is light and smooth, doesn’t bite, isn’t harsh nor does it tingle the nose on retrohale. Best flavour comes on retrohale. Seems to prefer a lighter pack. 

**Room Note:** Smoked in a room with a fruit hookah in use, so no comment. First round was smoked too hot and just smelled like tobacco. SO says it smells “sweet.”

**Thoughts:** I haven’t had much luck with the SG flakes, but this ribbon was easy to prep, pack and smoke. While I prefer a little more flavour in my aromatics, this is not too bad all around. This would be a great tobacco to teach one to smoke more slowly to coax out flavours without much risk of biting. Good nic kick from the burley. 

**Recommend to:** Aromatic smokers looking for a bridge to unflavored tobaccos; VA/BUR smokers looking for a gently flavoured aromatic.
Summary: This tobacco is a good training tool, but doesn’t seem to do much else. Straddling the aromatic and unflavored divide, it is rather one-dimensional but might stand in when a “pure” tobacco smoker wants something that won’t offend company or their tastes. 

**My Background:** I picked up the pipe about a year and a half ago, moving quickly from aromatics to latakia blends and then to exploring the gamut. Current favourites are Virginia blends featuring Kentucky (dark fired) and McClelland’s Virginia Woods.

3/5 Stars: Very smokable, innocuous, one-dimensional.

====================================
PipeBeard: Nice review.  I may give it a whirl for when I'm in the mood for something slow and sweet.  I'm a big fan of Gawith blends (best brown and firedance being my all time favorites).  Have you tried their wintertime flake?  It's a VA/Latakia flake that comes at the perfect moisture right out of the tin.  At first it seems like the lat is the star, but I was surprised at how much big virginia flavor there is in there.

pixeechick: Thanks, Pipebeard. I haven't tried any of the season flakes, although they are available locally. I must admit I was tempted, but I've been burned in my dances with Mr Gawith and didn't want to risk being hurt again. The Grousemoor has been interesting, and the ribbon cut something I can easily smoke, so I thought to give the CT a try. Mind, if you want to put a couple flakes in an envelope and send it overseas, I would happily do the same for something from my cellar as well. Just shoot me a PM if you're interested.

PipeBeard: I would love to. We're away for the next few days, but when I'm back on Monday I'll PM you to set something up.  What Gawith blends have you tried?
--
pixeechick: I've tried Sam's Flake and the Balkan Flake. I also have the Grousemoor (yum) and CT of course. I'll pm you my cellar list link and you can let me know what you're interested in.

====================================
LegesAequitas: Thanks for the review. It sounds like a pretty decent smoke. It's probably not something I would reach for because I've become fairly aromatic shy, but I have been giving some thought to trying to try a few more in the future. Why do you think it smoked too hotly the first time through?
--
pixeechick: I don't think it was the fault of the tobacco, rather that of the smoker. I think I packed it a bit too snug and it seems to expand a fair bit, preferring a looser initial packing. I think I was also too concerned about letting the ember go out (new smoker folly) rather than focusing on the flavours and smoking it the way it wanted to be smoked. I had smoked some C&D aromatic in the cob previously, which has a lot more flavour (artificial, that is), and is a bit more forgiving in the smoking cadence. I may have carried over the pace from that blend and expected the SG CT to smoke in the same way. 

So yeah, it's me, not you, Celtic Talisman.

antiwittgenstein: Well done. Its good to see you put up another review. 

...And very, very brave of you to put one up for a cherry aro. Next time might as well go full gandalf pipe.
--
pixeechick: Ha! That is very true. It's certainly not the cough-syrup cherry aro most worry about. Aros are not usually my thing, but this wasn't half-bad.
