Tobacco Review: Comoy's Cask No.4
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #37

**Blend Name:** Comoy’s Cask No.4

**Description on Tin:** Comoy's Cask #4 starts with top-notch Virginias, of the bright range, which are blended with a condimental amount of spicy Perique. A very light, almost unnoticeable top note is added and then the tobaccos are pressed and sliced, producing a flake with a dark sweetness and a citrusy character.
 
**Leaf:** Yellow-beige ~3” x 1”  (75 x 25 mm) flakes.  
 
**Tin Aroma:** Figgy, Raisins.
 
**Taste:** Grass and hay to start. Pepper and spice at the corners of the mouth. Depth builds in just a few puffs. Raisins, dried plums. Quite dry, which mutes the flavors a bit. Reminiscent of Orlik Golden Sliced. I would say this is the MP3 version of OGS – muted highs, shallow bass, and almost devoid of a middle. It is good mind you, but I don’t think this flake is made to compete at that level, at least without some age on it. I have had this only a month or so, so it really hasn’t had time to evolve. The pepper builds up, as do the hay flavors, which broaden into a nuttiness. A hint of sweetness is there, but it is always teasing around the tongue – enough to make you think it could be sweet at some point, just not now. These dark flavors are coming on even deeper than I had remembered. Full Virginia Flake fans will find something familiar here. Pulls some high notes off as it enters the halfway point. Sweetens up just a bit, but far less sweet than similar flakes. Powers through, the same plummy, slightly bread, faint citrus note till it grows ashy.
 
**Nicotine:** Quite mild. A sip of bourbon.

**Smokability:** Very happy to be folded and stuffed, but I find you can get a better flavor from it with a light rub.
 
**Room Note:** Warm tobacco – think a cigarette. A very nice, luxurious cigarette, but still a cigarette.

**Thoughts:** I don’t see much talk about Comoy’s, at least their tobacco. I figured I would try this budget flake out and I am happy I did. It is not ground breaking or floor pounding, but it is a straightforward Va Flake – good enough that I will investigate the other blends. I might not like it more than any of the other flakes, but I have smoked through it faster than any other tobacco I have bought – perhaps because it isn’t an overwhelming experience. It has that perfect combination of low price, good enough that I want to smoke it consistently, but not so dear to my heart that I stopper the jar up and bury it below my gold. I would love to see what 6 months does to this stuff, but I don’t think that it will survive much longer.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Very like the Peter Stokkebye Navy Flake, the Newminster Superior Navy Flake, shares a similar profile as Orlik Golden Sliced, and some of the richer flavors of Full Virginia Flake.

**Summary:** An easy smoking inexpensive Virginia flake with quality bass notes which I can’t stop smoking.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
IUseExtraCommas: What did Buchanan do, to earn himself bottom rating?  I can't remember, a dang thing about him!
--
Mordenkrad: Splitting political parties, failing to uphold promises, failing to take action while the country was falling apart at the brink of the Civil War, and generally fucking everything up.
--
antiwittgenstein: He was profoundly pro slavery - despite being from the North. He persuaded the Supreme Court, when handing down the Dred Scott decision (upholding the Fugitive Slave Act), to broaden the ruling to strike down the Missouri Compromise - so that any state could be a slave state. He meddled in the Kansas vote trying to rig the vote there to make it a slave state. And when Lincoln was elected he wanted to send soldiers to the southern forts - to help shore up the southern armed forces.
--
IUseExtraCommas: To earn a rating that bad, I'd pick up some cigarette butts, from the ground behind a crack house, spit on them, and stuff them in a really nice pipe.  That's some Buchanan level tobacco.

tribial: Love reading your review, thanks for posting!

CaptainDickPuncher: Nice review! I can't believe President Garfield didn't make your list of forgotten presidents. I mean Bush Sr doesn't seem very forgotten in my mind neither does Grant in my opinion. Garfield's successor Chester A Arthur is a pretty amusing forgotten president too for that matter.
--
antiwittgenstein: The problem with Garfield, Taylor, and WH Harrison are that they served for so short a time, they can neither offend nor inspire me. I put Grant and Bush I on there because, while they have good name recognition, there is very little popular understanding of their terms - even though Bush served just two decades back.
--
CaptainDickPuncher: Haha fair enough. I'm partial to the weird short term guys who couldn't really get much done. I enjoy them as such a weird footnote of history.
