Jake's Tastee Kake Review

/u/djscollin4 flipped me a sample of his OR VaPer plug. Like a dumb ass I didn't take pictures of it before I [ulu-ized it](http://i.imgur.com/qGBvbU3.jpg).  Nice mix of dark and medium to bright leaves with a "this is gonna be good aroma." Tiniest bit of licorice aroma, which does not piss me off. Nice looking slices, for sure. I air dried it for an hour and then nuked it for good measure. Still wasn't dry, but dinner was over and it was fire time!  

I carefully packed the [Arley Kurtz Flame All Day](http://i.imgur.com/5fNJpH4.jpg) and hit it with a match.  And another and another. Got some smoke rolling and got the tobacco heated up and releasing esters. After a few puffs the perique woke up and mellowed the mixture somewhat. Not surprisingly, it tasted like a newly opened tin of Virginia that needed six months to a year to calm down.  It was zingy... exuberant even. I hardly ever relight because I keep the pipe alive with the "breath through the pipe and exhale through the nose" VA sipping technique that prevents tongue scorch.  I had to continuously relight tonight because I just didn't have it dry enough.  

So who gives a shit about how many matches I used, right?  How'd it taste, you ask?  Well, if I'd made it, I'd be pretty damn proud. Great leaf and a mild casing (I suspect) that complemented the VA. Steamed my tongue, but no bite to speak of. The Virginia was too bright for my tastes, but the Perique did its job bringing forward the sweetness a bit. I would jar a half pound of this and smoke it all day this spring. I hear there's a Son of TK out there that has more stoved in it. I think that is going to add some base notes and balance the blend better, especially stoved red (hoo boy!)  Don't be stingy with the Perique, either.  That stuff is good for you. Great job, Jake, thanks for participating in another PipeTobacco Blend and Send and choosing me as a recipient. Made my night!

 
====================================
djscollin4: Awesome!  Glad it made it to you and thanks for the write up!  It definitely needs some jar time, but I was pretty happy with how it turned out.   It definitely has that "young VA taste/fell.  This blend has about 11% perique...v2.0 has closer to 17 for good measure!  Glad you enjoyed it.

Alligator_Gar: Just reading the 2.0 recipe tells me it's going to be phenomenal. Here's to learning and improving!

badmongo666: Going to piggyback my review here. 

Aroma is great: fruit and the anise/licorice topping. Slight whiff of the vinegar but that reminds me of McClelland VAs so it's something I like. 

First smoke was with no dry time in a pipe carved from a Mark Tinsky kit that I usually use for plugs and stiffer flakes (most recent being lots of 3P and War Horse Bar). Simple fold and stuff - flake was softer than most commercial flakes. Enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee. Once I got it going it stayed lit pretty well and and smoked well. 

Initially I got an unexpected tropical fruit note, but hard to place exactly what it was. Flavor moved through a brief Dr. Pepper/Cola flavor (I get this a lot from aged 5100), then moved more into the expected hay/citrus notes, and then settled into a sweet round bready flavor while keeping a few of the cola undertones. 

Did taste a little green still, very slight harshness, could faintly pick out the vinegar. Very nice VaPer flake for fall, but agree that some aging would likely help all of these. 

Let the sample dry overnight and then smoked a bowl in a clay pipe that I often use for tasting. Was still a little wet, but had tended much more toward the sweet/bready profile. Smoked the last of the sample after another day of drying in another pipe I'd carved from MT's briar - my best smoking pipe and one I typically smoke VAs in (most recently a lot of PS LBF, but it has a little bit of a Lakeland ghost) - got that same push toward the sweeter baked goods overtones. 

All in all very nice. Age would do it good, but I'd be inclined to smoke it while still a little wet - more going on with it like that. 

Well done Jake!
