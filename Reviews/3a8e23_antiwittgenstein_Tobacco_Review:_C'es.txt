Tobacco Review: C'est la Vie

Review #40

**Blend Name:** C’est La Vie

**Description on Tin:** C’est La Vie means “That’s life!”, and this smooth and satisfying, richly aromatic blend will definitely bring your taste buds to life. Made mostly of the finest flue-cured tobaccos, it is gently pressed and cut in the traditional Cavendish method. This process infuses the leaf with a richly sweet and creamy note of French vanilla flavor. Even though the enrapturing aroma will fill the room, the taste is remarkably subtle, and it’s wonderfully easy on the tongue. Take yourself on an intriguing Parisian vacation with the goodness of C’est La Vie.
 
**Leaf:** Long, thickish roan ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisin bread.
 
**Taste:** Toasted bread. A hint of sweetness. Sometimes a cherry-vanilla comes across. As the bowl progresses the flavors actually intensify, strange for an aro. The sweetness becomes more apparent, bringing with it a stronger vanilla, and brown bread with honey butter flavors. 

**Nicotine:** Pretty mild.

**Smokability:** A bit moist, but has better flavors when smoked a bit wetter than I like. The strands are kind of ungainly so I suggest giving them a further rub out. It bites a little. I have a fairly insensitive tongue, so take that as a serious warning.
 
**Room Note:** Sweet tobacco. Pretty mild. 

**Thoughts:** Not particularly bad but not particularly good either, this blend is like a movie with an okay cast and script but an inept director – so Star Wars Episode II. Not the worst, but nothing I will be rushing to revisit. A resounding meh.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Erin Go Bragh, Prince Albert

**Summary:** A sweet-burley aro with a touch of bite.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.
