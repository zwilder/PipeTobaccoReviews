KaeJS: Smoking FM Cellar while I watched your video.

It's one of my favourites, also. The whiskey notes are definitely in there. Especially on the retrohale.

Subbed.

====================================
ThePipeSigh: Not a bad start! 
One thing popped out at me: you didn't mention the whiskey. Even if you don't taste it, you might want to mention it, and the fact that you don't notice it (or do). For me, the whiskey is prominent in FMC, and gives it a heft of sweetness. 
You might want to touch on the flavors a little more. :)
--
drakemcguff: You rock!!! Thank you so much!!!!

====================================
Nicepuro: Well done brother! Keep'em coming. The video is really small on my iPhone playing through Reddit link, I'll open in browser next time.
