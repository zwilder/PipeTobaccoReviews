[Tobacco Review] Sutliff-Archduke Ferdinand
By: scriptonic
---
**Blend:** Sutliff – Archduke Ferdinand

**Blend Type:** Aromatic

**Ingredients:** Black Cavendish, Burley, Cavendish

**Description On Tin:** A complex vanilla aromatic, derived from seven sub brands.

**Leaf/Looks:** Ribbon cut, mostly light golden tobaccos, some black Cavendish.

**Tin Aroma/Smell**:  Birthday cake. Like straight up 7 year olds birthday cake. With thick vanilla frosting and a shit tons of sprinkles.

**Room Note**:  Vanilla.  Nothing too over powerful, quite pleasant for non-smokers.

**Taste:** Meh, I don’t get the complexity of the seven tobaccos that makes up this blend. It is very muddy, kind of like if you take a whole bunch of paint mixed it together and the result is brown. This is a very brown tasting tobacco. It isn’t bad, just not good.

**Smokability:** Smokes great with no relights down to the bottom of the bowl. 

**Summary:** It’s okay, smoke this if you are doing a project or doing something where you cannot concentrate on the tobacco you’re smoking.

**Background:** I’m a huge English Latakia bomb fan, the more the better, but at the same time I thoroughly enjoy Virginia Flakes and from time to time the occasional aromatic. 

**Pipe Smoked In:** Cob

**Drying Time:** 45 minutes in the traditional method of leaving it on a try to dry….I found doing this gave this tobacco a very hot steam taste. 15 minutes on a sheet pan in the oven on VERY low (140°F). Drying out the tobacco this way got rid of that goopiness that you normally associate with heavy aromatics. The tobacco was not too dried out, it didn’t crumble at all when I took a pinch; but yet all of that casing seemed to just disappear. 

**Rating**: 2.5-3 out of 5….probably closer to the 2.5 spectrum of that rating.
