Tobacco Review : Esoterica Brighton
By: Jaxx2112

**Blend Name:** Esoterica Tobacciana:  Brighton

**Description on Tin:** A notably smooth blend of six Virginia tobaccos, light in color, soft and satisfying.

**Presentation/Leaf/Cut:**   I cannot comment on the tin presentation of this tobacco as I received it in bulk.  The tobacco is a mixture of varying shades of brown. The cut is between a ribbon and a shag cut, leaning much closer to a shag.  It is a fine mesh of long strands of tobacco that clump easily.  The moisture out of pouch was fine, and after a month of remaining in the heavy duty ziplock bag, is still moist enough to gurgle out of the bag.  I doubt humectants are used considering Esoterica’s reputation as a blender, but that the tobacco itself comes rather moist to begin with.

**Tin Aroma:**  Opening the bag, you are first greeted with a heavy virginia odor.  Bright punchy virginia melds with the richer more ‘tobacco-ee’ virginias present.  I detect a mild astringency that I can’t place.

**Taste:**  The charring light brings forward a strong tobacco taste.  Notes of earth, grass and maybe hay come forward with a slight astringency.  The blend has a light astringent lemon finish, with no additional citrus.  It is straightforward and non-complex.  Earthy virginias are balanced with bright citrus( in this case, lemon) virginia.

**Room Note:**  The room note is relatively pleasant, but does smell of a virginia burning.  Some people claim most Virginias smell cigarette-ee, but I disagree.  I doubt you’d offend with this room note.

**Smokability:**  This tobacco is way too harsh for what it’s offering.  I think that the blend itself is a bit too green out of the get go (or i got a bum batch) and am a bit disappointed.  I got a significant amount of tongue bite and throat irritation from this blend, despite three different occasions with three different smoking habits.  It’s possible i’ve yet to unlock the potential of this blend, but at this point i’d rather set it aside in a mason jar to mellow and develop.  Considering it is a pure virginia, it should age splendidly.  The tobacco burns wonderfully and the flavor is straightforward enough for this to be an all day smoke.  The nicotine kick is stronger than Esoterica’s Hastings, but definitely weaker than Orlik Golden Sliced or Hal O’ the Wynd.  Overall i’d say the strength is medium/medium-low, closer on the medium side. If five brother’s is a 10, 1Q is a 1, and Orlik Gold Sliced is a 5, then this is a 3.5-4.

**Thoughts:**  I was rather disappointed with this blend.  Each time I smoked it smoked harsh whether wet, dry or in between.  The taste was mild, and when it came together it was pleasant, but nothing i’d write home about.  While it was easy to light and relatively low maintenance, what it delivered didn’t justify the cost (irritation and tongue bite).  I wish I had some age on this tobacco to see if it develops well or not, but for now I have to judge it based on how i received it.
 
**Smoked In:** Nording African Meerschaum with a 7/8’’ bore, MM Country Gentleman with 6/8’’ bore and Doran Poker with a 7/8’’ bore.  Of the three, I found no significant difference in the tastes present.  Despite the physical differences (Medium sized, smaller sized cob, and large poker) of the three, i was still disappointed with each smoke.

**Fire Used:**  Angled flame Tsubota Pearl Eddie (old boy style) lighter.  Matches.  No discernable difference between the two mediums.

**Attempted Pairings:**  Organic Lemonade, Water.  Of the two, I favored the lemonade as it allowed me to ignore the astringency of the finish and look for other tastes.  Overall, this blend is relatively non-complex and the lemon finish may pair quite nicely with a cup of black coffee.

**Recommend to:** Virginia and English smokers looking for an all day smoke with limited complexity, with enough patience and mason jars as required.

**Summary:**  A well executed virginia balances the earth, fruit and citrus of the leaf to create a unique flavor experience, while remaining free of irritation.  Esoterica’s Brighton fell flat in this in many ways.  The blend was harsh, and lacked the flavor gradient I expected from a blend incorporating 6 different virginia leaves.  Despite the flavor lacking complexity, the smoke would have been more pleasant if it had mellowed more.  I expected a little more from a tobacco company that has been around since the [1820s](http://www.jfgermain.co.je/) to have pre-aged the tobacco more to remove the edge like it does Stonehaven and Penzance.  Despite my complaints with the blend, I did enjoy the relaxed flavor profile the blend offered; hay and earth married the mild astringency of the lemon.   Overall, I’d give it a 3 / 5.  

**Would I buy a pound of it?:**  Due to the harshness that came and left throughout the smoke, i’d be hard pressed to commit to buying a pound of this tobacco.  That being said, if the remaining 1.5 oz ages well in a mason jar, I will certainly consider it.

**Value:**  At $23.94 an 8oz bag online ($2.99 an ounce), it’s actually a relatively inexpensive blend for what you’re getting.  It may not be as cheap as Peter Stokkebye, but it’s certainly an affordable tobacco.

**My Background:** I’ve been a pipe smoker since 2010.  I’ve run the gamut between styles and have settled (for now) on Virginias, VaPers, Aro-English and Burley blends.  I’m not terribly fond of heavy Latakia blends, however I do enjoy them on rare occasions.  My staples as of this review are LJ Peretti’s Park Square, Hal O the Wynd, Carter Hall and Peter Stokkebye’s Luxury Twist.

====================================
BriarTongue: Nice review! Although I enjoy Virginia blends, I'd rather pass on Brighton after reading your review. Thanks
--
Jaxx2112: My thoughts exactly. Hopefully in a few months I can revisit it more favorably.
--
BriarTongue: Had any other Esoterica blends? I've recently tried Dunbar & Tillbury, both are top-quality easy everyday smokers. I'm wondering whether their other blends are similar. Personally I prefer thicker cuts to the ribbon/shag cuts from Esoterica.
--
Jaxx2112: Not yet, so far just these two and Penzance. I'm looking to try tillbury and Dorchester in the future.
