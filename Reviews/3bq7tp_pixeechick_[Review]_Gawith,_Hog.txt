[Review] Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. Brown Flake Unscented.

I got a baggie of this and Erinmore in the mail from /u/antiwittgenstein. The baggie for the [BF U/S](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/34sc86/tobacco_review_brown_flake_unscented/) was unmarked except for a warning:

Warning noted, I packed this into a cob that hangs about for whatever smoking needs arise. It's day two of packing up the house, so I'm ready for a sit-down for a smoke.

**Tin Description:** "Stoved and pressed, the Virginias and Burley tobaccos are married into a wonderful flake." ([Smoking Pipes](http://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/gawith-hoggarth/bulk/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=3997))

"As with Bright CR Flake, this is another tobacco that devises its flavour simply from the choice of leaf in the blend, and has no additional casings or flavours to enhance the smoke. (u/s - stands for unscented) 83.5% Blended virginias are combined with a relatively high (for English Blends at any rate) proportion of Malawi Burley, 12.5%, to give flavour and depth to the smoke, and the addition of just 4% Malawi dark fired leaf is sufficient to combat the typical sharpness of the virginia leaf resulting in a rounded medium strength smoke." ([Tobacco Reviews](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/557/gawith-hoggarth-co-brown-flake-u-s))

**Appearance:** The flakes are about 8-10cm long, a tan color with some striations of darker and lighter leaf. The flakes came with good moisture and have dried out in the baggie over the last several weeks. It's almost crispy now, but has just enough moisture to rub out without completely crumbling into a fine shag with some chunks of flake. 

The contents are Malawi Burley, Malawi Dark Fired, and Virginia. 

**Taste:** Starts floral, but quickly moves to a citrusy-lemon with cocoa and chocolate undertones. 

The floral comes back with a relight, but it's not the floral I typically associate with Lakeland blends. There's something different here that I can't quite place. 

Moving down the bowl, the taste remains consistent. This is a smoke and let it ride blend for me. It doesn't require much thought, is just interesting enough to not bore but not so complex it requires a meditation on the leaf. It would make a good candidate for an all-day smoke for anyone who enjoys a Lakeland blend, or doesn't mind a light floral flavor. 

The VAs are sweet and there's a light hay taste that comes out as the bowl progresses.

**Smokability:** It burns well, and wouldn't have required a relight if I had paid a little more attention to it. At this level of dehydration the bowl gets a bit hot, but the smoke itself stays cool. Medium-Full strength.

**Room Note:** Can't say for sure. Smoked on a breezy day with open windows and my SO enjoying some EMP beside me. 

**Thoughts:** This is a lightly-floral blend of quality tobaccos with a bit of a kick. The burleys add a nice backbone to stiffen up the sweet and hay-like Virginias. All-around quality blend. I'm not sure I'd keep much of this around for myself, but it was great to sample. I'll certainly finish up the baggie in the coming weeks. If you like lakelands I would certainly recommend it. /u/pipebeard might want to try it out.

**Rating**
5/5 - I'm going to cellar several pounds  
4/5 - Worth picking up a tin/a couple ounces  
**3/5 - Acceptable to receive in a trade** *(If you're into Lakelands)*  
2/5 - If you're running out of tobacco, it's alright.  
1/5 - Only if it's the last thing at the B&M.  
0/5 - Not even if it's the last leaf on Earth.  

**Background:** Been smoking for almost two years; made a quick transition from aromatics to natural tobaccos, primarily virginias with some latakia blends. Current favorites: Savinelli Brunello Flake, Savinelli Dublone dâ€™Oro and Solani Silver Flake.
====================================
jarvis400: Thanks for the fine review.

I always get a whiff of floral tones in all unscented G&H blends. Many say that it's because of added topping or because of cross contamination from the scented tobaccos, but I'm actually beginning to think it's actually natural aroma from the empire tobaccos they use. But who knows, this is just my two euro cents.

====================================
crimsonrat: Good review. I can't even smoke the unscented stuff from them. I always taste that flavoring in there.

====================================
Formaldehydeontoast: I really enjoy this flake, cheap, easily available from my tobacconist (last time I was lucky enough to get some sugar crystals over mine), you've really nailed the flavour profile. The heat produced in the bowl does require some careful puffing, but it must be my tastebuds because I just cant find that lakeland essence everyone talks about.

====================================
soymilkisgood: I like this one every once in a while as a changeup. Just the right amount of lakelands to get a hint but not be overwhelming in my opinion. Nice review!

====================================
tennesseean_87: I like this stuff, and the scented version is maybe my favortie scented lakeland. I think it's a wonderful stoved VA with just enough form the DF and Burley to punch up the body a bit. I think fans of BBF should like this, too.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Glad you enjoyed it! Your review is much more...fair than mine. Probably more useful to the sub's potential Lakeland smokers as well.

pixeechick: Thank you for it. It was kinder to me than to you I think, although maybe not my usual fare. I would hate for you to accidentally light up a pipe of the scented version!
