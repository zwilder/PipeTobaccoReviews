Review #55

**Blend Name:** Sutliff Taste of Autumn

**Description on Tin:** Rich spicy flavors of autumn top this blend of Virginia and burley tobaccos.
 
**Leaf:** Dark brown ribbon with big chunks of black ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Pumpkin pie spices, vanilla, rich tobacco, vanilla custard.
 
**Taste:** Pumpkin pie spices. Nutmeg, a hint of cinnamon, cloves. Subtle pumpkin flavor itself. Dead leaves and the dirty ground. This is… this is basically the pumpkin spice latte taste profile. Creamy. Nutty. Rich elegant flavors, the kind I found in Captain Black Royal, which I can’t really put my name on – something like vanilla custard. There are long vanilla undertones buoying up the spices. Sweet, but not in a way to make you constantly aware of it, just sweet enough to hold all of it together. Occasionally a Virginia tang comes through, which mixing with the creaminess gives the impression of buttermilk pie. Complex, but overall consistent through the bowl, down to the ashes. The flavors are strong and distinct. It is quite unlike other aromatics in a similar vein.

**Nicotine:** Mild, but noticeable. But I have been smoking this out of a mammoth bowl.

**Smokability:** Drier than Molto etc, but it still needs an hour or so of drying time. Bites a bit. Performs well for an aro I guess. Doesn’t turn bitter at the end.
 
**Room Note:** Warm pumpkin pie.

**Thoughts:** This is what I what I think we all want an aromatic to be. It tastes much as it smells. It isn’t too wet and burns easily. This is by far the best Type I (Cavendish and Casing) style aromatic I have had thus far. It makes me want to try more of these blends. I am not a good aromatic smoker. They are always at the bottom of my rotation. I don’t get excited about smoking them, or collecting them. I bought a Grabow with a tiny bowl to smoke them out of, because I could not be bothered to smoke even a 30 minute jaunt out of my cob. But I think Taste of Autumn is phenomenal. Mind you, Autumn is, in the immortal words of Thomas Jefferson “My jam” and I do like the aforementioned Pumpkin Spice Latte. Yet even subtracting my biases, I think most of you would also be impressed with this blend. You don’t have to baby it constantly, you don’t have to perform special smoking techniques to taste the flavor. It tastes how it smells, and it smells just like Autumn does to me. I am going to give this by far the highest mark of any Type I aromatic I have reviewed thus far. Now I want some turkey and dressing…

**Similar Tobaccos:** Captain Black Royal, C&D Autumn Evening 

**Summary:** A Pumpkin Spice Latte you smoke

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
ImherefortheH1Z1: Interesting.  Have you had Status's Sleepy Hollow, and would you make any comparisons between the two, as much of what you have described, to me is analogous of the Sleepy Hollow (maybe apart from the room note)
--
antiwittgenstein: Nope, I haven't had it, so I couldn't say. Hit me up if you want to trade samples.

ImherefortheH1Z1: You have pm.

====================================
Godecapitator: Did the ghost haunt the Grabow badly or bout the same as other aros?.Cinnamon & clove frighten me or is it not that strong?
--
antiwittgenstein: Honestly I can't really help you on this one. I smoked this out of my cob several times, so no ghosting there. And I have smoked it out of a new to me estate, which I haven't used for anything else. I would just assume it would ghost pretty badly. It is alot of flavor.
