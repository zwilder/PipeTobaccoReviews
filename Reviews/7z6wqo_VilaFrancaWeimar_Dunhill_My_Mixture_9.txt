Dunhill My Mixture 965 - A Review
By: VilaFrancaWeimar
---
There is a lot to be said in defense of 965 in general. A lot of folks don’t really think it holds up to the former versions, but if that is the case, I really would like to know those former versions, because this is probably one of the best latakia mixtures I have ever had. So, I have been discovering some of the dunhill line because of its long inevitable death (well, maybe not, hopefully) and I finally got to try 965. As a mixture, I have to admit it has been off my radar, maybe because it has a very boring looking tin, maybe because it is not sold as something heavy or as a powerhouse blend, maybe I just didn’t like the number, but then I tried the tin, and it was honestly glorious.  Let’s get the review started:

Before the smoke- 
Classic ribbon cut, smells like a campfire. You also get leather, something acidic too. It just smells like an absolute Standard English mixture, even though it technically isn’t one. Sometimes I just like to open the tin and smell it.

Beginning of the smoke – 
Burns cool enough and without any trouble. You can tell there is a sweetness here that it doesn’t exist in other dunhill English blends like nightcap. This sweetness isn’t like a topping, and it doesn’t overwhelm what is generally a very savory smoke, it just really complements it. 

During the smoke – 
The consistency is astonishing. As I smoke it doesn’t really taste ashy, burn too hot, etc. Even though it really is not viewed as a latakia heavy mixture, I would say it has a substantial amount of it, the real science of it however, is how very balanced and tasty this blend is. If you want to get blasted by a lat-bomb, go elsewhere. If you want an oriental forward blend, this isn’t it. However, if you are searching for one or the other, and find yourself with this instead, you might really change your mind about what you want. By the way, when I say balanced, I really don’t mean weak or neutral, it is just right.

After the smoke – 
Usually I don’t smoke indoors so can’t really tell you a lot about a room note, But beard note is very pleasant, even though it doesn’t really stick. You just feel satisfied when you’re done.

Overview – 

It turned out that even though a lot of people in the internet really don’t care for this version of 965, I really have to say that it is my favorite dunhill blend so far by a very long distance. I even believe that the former version might have been better in some ways, but don’t shit on my plate and call it chocolate, this is very *very* good! I really recommend it if you haven’t tried it already before it runs out, and let’s hope there is an even better next version!

====================================
butter404: I love 965, to me it is well balanced, burns nicely, smokes easily, and you can actually taste the Virginia. It is one I reach for over and over again.

damadfaceinvasion: 2nd English I tried after Frog Morton. I can’t stand the stuff honestly. Burns the hell out of my tongue and tastes like someone holding a flaming piece of leather to your mouth. I bought a tin of Standard Mixture afterwards and enjoyed that a lot more. 
--
smellthehatfirst: 965 contains a fair amount of English-style Cavendish.   It will, by its nature, burn a little hotter than some of the alternatives.

So yes, if you smoke it like a freight train, you are going to burn yourself.

kingjames488: it was my second "english" after FM too, it's kinda meh. the cavendish in it tastes like captain black without the topping IMO and gives me a weird mouth feel.

====================================
brainskan13: I'm a fan. I like 965. I don't smoke it regularly, but I keep some around. I'm not a fan of Latakia bombs. I prefer Balkans and other oriental-forward blends when it comes to Latakia in my smoke.

====================================
scmkr: 965 is the best.  I love that stuff.

antiwittgenstein: Swank review pipe mate. 965 was my favorite English for a very long time. It is still a great one especially to go back to. Like Squadron Leader, it is a touchstone blend, it captures so much of what the genre is like all in one smoke.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you, I am glad you liked it! I might open that tin of squadron leader, because I just finished my 965 and knowing myself I'll get latakia cravings!

PigpenMcKernan: Nice review.

I hate 965.  Tastes like acrid ash and burns the heck out of my throat.  Why does it burn my throat?! I don't inhale.

Also, so far it is the only tobacco that I have experienced this extreme harshness and throat burning from.  Why? Is there a different humectant on this blend?  I don't know, but I don't like it.  EMP on the other hand i could smoke until the end of time.
--
ThatGuyGaren: Do you have any age on the 965? A few months does wonders to it.
--
PigpenMcKernan: Yeah, I've tried it after some time in the tin/jar. I find most Dunhill blends need some time before they really shine. I don't know what it is about 965, but I can't get past the harshness.
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: It might be because it is heavy in nicotine. I am a cigarrette smoker, and quite used to it, so there might be some harshness that I really don't feel. Glad you liked the review even if you disagree with it!
--
PigpenMcKernan: Certainly not the vitamin N content that is putting me off, I have no problem with nightcap or other strong blends.  
--
damadfaceinvasion: I experienced the same thing. Never had that problem with nightcap though. What is EMP like?

====================================
RoundedColt8: MM965 was actually the first English I smoked, this stuff isn't bad. I prefer VA's and VA/Per's over English blends so I don't smoke it often, but having some time in a jar should do it well. The tin date says it was in the tin a good few months before I jarred it so that's a good sign, lol.

====================================
youngs11: Nice review. This is one of my favorite blends. Unique, complex, and pretty strong, perfect for evening smokes
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Thank you, and I also tend to agree that it shines as a night time blend, even though one can enjoy it all day long
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: 965 holds a special place in my heart. I should buy another 10 tins....
