[Review] C&D: Blockade Runner
By: Sku77s
---
Blend Name: Cornell & Deihl: Blockade Runner

Description on Tin: A true Navy Cavendish crumble cake. Hand stoved red VA and golden VA soaked in premium rum for seven days.

Leaf: Straight red an golden virginia flakes pressed into a dense crumble cake. Heavier on the red VA's with the golden holding the place of a sweetener condiment tobacco.
Tin Aroma: Rum, rum, rum, with a smooth Virginia undertone. But definitely rum heavy in its tin note. Also there's the hint of some top notch red virginia, a little more subdued and darker in its note than most McClelland red's I've had which is where most of my red Va knowledge comes from. 

Taste: A really straight forward rum and virginia taste. Gives you a slight salty taste, not the clean spray of being out on the open ocean but the briney dark taste of the docks, docks without yachts and pleasure boats instead fishing vessels and oil leaking tug boats. I've tried a lot of navy style blends. This is the only one that ever has set me back eyes closed and made me feel like I was back to living next to the ocean. It's really something else.

Smokability: Load light and go. The only tobacco I have had at this level of ease and forgiveness is Carter Hall. Let me put this in other terms, this isn't a hand ground roast coffee or a craft beer. This is your grandpas's grandpa's navy cavendish, forgiving in its smokeability but holding back nothing in flavor and note. I can easily enjoy a couple bowls back to back no bite and still not be burnt out on its profile.

Room Note: A little less than pleasing note from some peoples perspective. It has an potent rum top note followed by a seemingly misplaced red virginia creamy goodness. They really go well together to mellow themselves out in my own opinion. YMMV. 

Thoughts: Go tell Jack Sparrow I found where all the rum has gone. Let me put this in other terms, this isn't a hand ground roast coffee or a craft beer. This is your workhorse navy cavendish, its a black roast coffee from a rusted aluminum tin brewed on a stove top. It's not there to delicately please your palate. It's here to get it's navy cavendish job done and done right by god. Giving you a blast of rum and tobacco to last. Also seven days is the length of time tobacco was stored in rum barrels while it made its way overseas from the colonies to Jamaica, which is a +1 to attention in my book.

Recommend to: People who enjoy a bold flavor profile, but you do have to enjoy rum. Also those who are interested in a more straight forward navy cavendish sans perique or burley's. These's no spice or flavor missing it's all being carried by the rum soaked goodness. Also anyone who's tired of the weaker profile of some rum imbued flakes and blends. If those left you wanting this might be for you.

Summary: A forgiving flavorful blend with a foot in history. I feel like this tobacco has received some negative reviews because the smokers didn't realize what they were getting into with its flavor. This is soaked for seven days in premium rum. Not topped. Not cased. Soaked, stuffed into a barrel with rum and stored. They could have told me they threw lead in and let Poseidon imbued it with the essence of the sea, I'd take it to the bank.
Honestly and all ribbing adside. this blend has stuck with me over three years of piping experience. I've never found a Navy style blend that matches what I expected of a old style "we smoke this because its what we have and we made the best of it" blend. I've ranged more blends in that department than any other, probably some 15-20 different blends touted as a "Navy Cavendish" this is still the one for me. Not that I'll ever stop searching for its competition.

My Background: I'm doing this review to make up in my mind for the less than sterling review I gave Three Friars. I just didn't want to leave my old friends C&D on bad terms so I'm posting this to show my love of their cakes (which Friars should be).  Also I plan to finish the reviews from the perique sampler soon just taking a break from smoking such similar blends.
 As usual here's my background goodies : 3 years smoking a pipe, occasionaly enjoy a cigar, previous nail smoker. Tasted this in a briar, cob, and a clay.

====================================
WayOutWest: Nice review. Have a tin on hand that I am putting a little age on. What was the age of the tin you smoked?
--
Sku77s: Fresh. I haven't managed to keep this cellared it's always finding a way to my pipe. But being a Virginia blend should age nicely.
--
====================================
Chuzordie: Carter Hall is my one true tobacco love ( afaik ).  So Blockade Runner might be next on my menu.  Thanks for the write up.
--
Sku77s: I'm gonna warn you, the only way the two are similar is in their forgiveness. Flavor and note wise Blockade Runners a different animal. Definitely worth a shot.
--
Chuzordie: trade ya sample of that for some of my  Winchester.. ill toss in a sample of Old College or Star of the East   your choice  there all C&D.

====================================
rkdc: I'm pretty excited to try this - I've got a few Navy styles I'll be trying after I finish my Va/Per taste test, so I've got a tin of this ready to go.  Thanks for the review!
--
Sku77s: Oh hey what navy styles do you have? I'm sitting on a few but always looking for more.
--
rkdc: I've got McClelland's Navy Cavendish, GL Please Navigator, McClelland's Dark Navy Flake, and C&D After Hours Flake lined up to go with the Blockade Runner. 

I am thinking of also ordering the McClelland Townsman Cavendish Silver (since I enjoy the Blue so much)
