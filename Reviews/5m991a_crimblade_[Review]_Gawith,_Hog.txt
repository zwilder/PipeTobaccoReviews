[Review] Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. - Happy (Brown) Bogie
By: crimblade

**Blend Name:** Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. - Happy (Brown) Bogie 

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** This is a dark fired and dark air cured Twist. Also known as Happy Bogie. An old fashioned rope tobacco that provides a stout smoke with high nicotine content.

All our twist tobacco varieties are manufactured by the same spinning process using dark fired wrapper leaves. The filler is again, predominantly dark fired leaf with the addition of a small percentage of dark air cured Indian leaf. They are therefore strong tobaccos.

**Leaf:** Rope made of nothing but Burley and Virginias. Dark brown wrapped leaves twist about in about a 1/2 inch rope. Gives you a contact high just by picking it up.

**Tin Aroma:** Musty, like the smell of loom. No descriptor really is fitting other than it smells of the earth.

**Taste:** Rich earthy tobacco. A pepper that stings the tongue and the back of the throat. A creamy burn on the retrohale. A slight tingling sensation in the scalp and face. Smokey rainbows that dance before your eyes. Tasting colors is a thing.

**Smokability:** It's moist in it's rope form. I've found that slicing it thin, rubbing it out, and letting it dry for about 30 minutes does the best. It can go alright with coins, but they take longer to dry. It burns really nicely prepared correctly and leaves nothing but a nice ash. About midway through the smoke it can be a little problematic if you happen to set your pipe down due to a decreased ability to find it again. Forget getting up and walking around while enjoying this, although I did find that that's when I got the most earthy flavors. Not from the tobacco mind you, mostly from the dirt that somehow got in my mouth when tottering lead to teetering which lead to gravity. If you can avoid succumbing to the need to stand or go anywhere but where you are then you will find Nirvana waiting for you just over the horizon. 

**Room Note:** Pretty much how it tastes, just good smokey earthy tobacco.

**Thoughts:** This is one to try. Mind you if you haven't eaten a huge meal, aren't properly seated, and aren't seat belted then your worlds about to change. Smoked in small quantities it's very manageable, though you'll still be surprised when you think "oh that wasn't so bad, I feel fine, that crimblade's a wuss" then stand up only to find yourself adrift. This is a special occasion smoke for me, and it's actually mellowed in the time since I got it this spring and the months it's spent jarred. One way I really enjoyed it is by slicing a few coins and interspersing it in a bowl of Mixture Monster, which I then called bogie monster. It was a kicker when you hit the coin, both in flavor and in a lost sense of balance. 

**Recommend to:** Those who want to taste nothing but good quality tobacco. Someone who wants to ride a rollercoaster without paying for the ticket.

**Summary:** This blend can show you a world, shinning, shimmering, splendid. Tell me pipers, now when did you last let your heart decide? It can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder , take you sideways and under, on a magic smokey ride. A whole new Woooooorrrllld.

**Drink Pairings:**  Anything with sugar, trust me, preferably lighter flavors. Squirt was awesome with it, though pepsi is always classic. If you can get them, Unicorns Tears nicely compliment your ascension with this blend.

**Final Rating:** 4/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 3 years. My current favorites are Frog Morton's Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
levins0: The secret to this blend is to already be lying in your hammock before you light the bowl.

You'll wake up some time later feeling quite refreshed, but unsure of the current date.

crimblade: It was one of my favorite hammock blends when it was still warm out!

====================================
FullFrontalNoodly: There seems to be quite a bit of misinformation out there on this one.  If you source information directly from Gawith Hoggarth, you will only ever find the words "dark-fired Virginia" or "air-cured Virginia" in relation to their ropes.  I have never found any reference to the use of burley from GH, and I am quite certain this is a result of people confusing the terms *dark-fired*  and *air cured.*  Personally, I don't get any of the taste or mouth feel I associate with burley in here either.

But regardless of what is in it, it is some damn good stuff.  This is one you really need to be careful about not over-drying before smoking -- you'll lose a *huge* range of flavors if you do.  I find that if you cut the rope into coins and rub them out 10 minutes is sufficient -- and this is in an climate where I typically struggle to dry my tobaccos.

I also find this blends well with Black Irish X.  If you find the Black Irish X to be just a little too "meaty" this is a great way to dial that back a bit without reducing the strength of your smoke.


--
misterzipp0: My thoughts are that the misinformation stems from the fact that dark fired is usually a form of Burley.

This misunderstanding was shown early on when or OGs mentioned that it used Burley when they meant perique which is in fact, a type of Burlie
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Dark firing is a curing process that is *typically* used on burley tobaccos, to the point where the term has become synonymous with burley tobaccos.  However, that is not the case here.

Perique is the name of a tobacco made from a specific type of burley, so all perique tobaccos are also going to be burley tobaccos.


--
misterzipp0: Right on. People think that all dark fired is burley (not always, as seen here) so they ran with "burley".

My OGS comment might not have enough context.  If you read any of the reviews from tobacco reviews.com there are a lot of people that make the comment saying "I have never tasted Burley in this blend blah blah blah"

At one time OGS mentioned on the tin that it contained burley. It did contain burley in the form of perique but I think that confused a lot of people.
--
givemeyours0ul: I was worried it had dark fired burley in it, which I just don't *get* yet.
--
crimblade: Thanks for the info! I had actually thought that it was just a Virginian blend but when I was pulling the Tin Description from TobaccoReviews it had Burley listed as a component. Instead of digging deeper I just said "oh" and put that in. 

Anything less than 30 minutes dry time for me and I end up with a incredibly fitful smoke that ends in damp dottle. That being said I did make the mistake of letting it dry for a couple hours once and that was mostly just hot air.

====================================
TacticalBro: I am new to the rope tobacco world, but these things are just plain ridiculous. Before smoking my Gawiths black Irish x, I read the reviews. One gentlemen claimed this left him **in jis underwear, fighting rats with a pen.** 

I literally took 6 puffs, just to get my charring light going, and had to put the pipe down. My fianc√© went inside because of the smell. She thinks I didn't join her to finish that pipe. 
I didn't go inside because I couldn't move. And because I was  inwardly distracted by how funny the human mouth is. 
 I finished the bowl the next day. It was a damn great smoke 



*Rope Bacca*

givemeyours0ul: I've got an ounce of this I haven't touched yet. Maybe it's time...

Edit: It was time. Amazing.
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: You inspired me to cut into mine for the first time. I really like this stuff! The nic feeling is like the first time I smoked an RP Edge, but mellower. I got the same mellow and contented feeling with my first Opus X Churchill.   
I cut into thin coins with my cutter, shredded one and put it at the bottom, tumbled the coins in, ruffled one more and put it on top. A few relights, not too bad. A rich, earthy smoke. I'm smoking it in a pipe with a minor Latakia ghost, enjoying that extra little campfire flavor. I may mix a pinch of GH lat into my next bowl.  
I haven't tried standing up yet....
--
crimblade: Awesome! I'm glad you enjoyed it, it really is a good one Nic hit notwithstanding. Good luck on that standing thing when you get to it!
--
====================================
FlosCarmeli: Pepsi makes me want to hurt myself.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Personally, I don't understand how people can enjoy a pipe while drinking *any* carbonated beverage.

--
misterzipp0: Real Sugar Pepsi and 2 pours of Old Monk will change your world!

Carbonated beverages and a pipe will change your tongue.
--
FlosCarmeli: If I'm going to voluntarily drink soda, it's going to be Coke.
--
misterzipp0: No Coke, Pepsi .
--
FlosCarmeli: No
--
givemeyours0ul: No
--
givemeyours0ul: I love you, my downvote angel...
--
unclegabby: I don't do sugary beverages when i smoke. Tea, coffee, water or club soda. Club soda is my preferred one because the carbonation leaves the pallet clean plus tingles. I don't know how people smoke while drinking Pepsi etc. 
--
====================================
TheNutPair: Great review!  This is one I've been wanting to try for quite some time.  Your review gave me the nudge I needed to add it to my next order.  

--
====================================
brainskan13: Thanks for the entertaining review. [chuckles]
I tried some SG brown rope a few years ago. It's good but I just can't smoke that level 'bacco on any regular basis. I still have some left. I'm too much of a whimp. 
--
====================================
asshole_on_purpose: I bought a rope of this recently due to looking for very high nicotine blends without the unpleasantness that I get from most burley-forward tobaccos. I grew up farming dark-fired Virginia as a kid and this had the smell of the leaves of my childhood. 

Despite wanting a lot of nicotine due to quitting cigarettes and wanting some replacement with my pipe, this had me green and on my ass with a few puffs and a retrohale. My brother, a nonsmoker, full with childish nostalgia, has taken to slicing thin coins and setting them in his cheek. He, with no nicotine tolerance, gets the spins if he actually chews it. He enjoys the hell out of this tobacco and I appreciate it, though I cannot smoke it.
