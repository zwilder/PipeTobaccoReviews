There once was a man from Nantucket – A review of Gordon Pym
By: VilaFrancaWeimar

Edgar Allen Poe is synonymous with grim tales and dark poetry, a giant in American literature, who also wrote the novel “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket”. Poe, a former pretty boy of the literary scene, had his book trashed by critics at the time of release. This amazing work of literature was only recognized as such after his death, by gaining the praise of one of my personal favorites, Jorge Luis Borges, that almost single handedly stole it from the pits of obscurity and brought it to a new wave of fresh brained critics. It is a grossly underrated piece of art that deals beautifully with very complex subjects, whose leitmotif is deepness, darkness and what is yet to be discovered.

Dan tobacco’s Gordon Pym is an English mixture, and in a lot of ways is just like that novel. It is an adventure by itself, incredibly rich and deep, while being simultaneously unappreciated.

I have to admit that I am very biased about this blend for nostalgic purposes, not because I have tried it before, but because it reminded me of the blend that made me love piping. The first time I smoked that unique looking tin, a whole new world opened up right in front of me, and I thought that that feeling was to be replicated… nevermore (yes, I know it is cheesy). The flavors, the absolute coolness, the tanginess, the “humpfh”, they were all there the first time I tried Gordon Pym.

Before the smoke: 
The smell! That Latakia odor that I can only classify as “horse stables”, only this time is acidic and weirder. Vinegar? There is a tanginess that might be related with the use of Syrian Latakia (yes, that one), but I cannot really tell you for sure, since I have never had it before. It is real tasty and I adore it. However, it doesn’t stink, it doesn’t ooze out of the tin, and it will not kick you in the head. I smell leather all over, and it is glorious. I don’t know if you can’t tell, but I haven’t had Latakia in a while. By contrast, the tin itself was bland and without much personality, probably because it is not a best seller, Dan Tobacco doesn’t even bother to give it the previous tin art and puts a functional white sticker with cancer notices according to our EU overlords.

Beginning of the smoke:
Lights great and easy, it has a classic ribbon cut and it is probably the coolest smoke in the market, honestly. If you are not accustomed to English blends, the beginning might be a little overwhelming, but it gets smoother as you smoke.

During the smoke:
When you light up you might get the feeling it is a sit down type of English, but it really isn’t. I have been smoking a whole tin of a very light tobacco, so the difference between them was a big one, however, as you get accustomed it begins to open up. The frame of reference I had for it was Presbyterian, but kind of lighter, with some tartness and a lot less spicy. Even though it has those slight differences, it would be a marvelous substitute to Presbyterian if you do not have access to it (as I know a lot of American pipers are right now), but it also stands as a blend with its own personality and character. It is different enough, but also close enough to that great blend. It also gets sweeter as you puff. 

After the smoke: 
The beard note is strong. I smell like I’m wearing a Gimp mask from all the leathery smell that surrounds my face for the rest of the day, not that I would know anything about that. I wouldn’t recommend smoking it close to the ladies, or to the gents with a sensitive nose. It can be an all-day tobacco, depending on your tastes; I mostly would keep it to the night time.

Overview:
I like it a lot. It is by far the coolest smoke I have ever experienced, it has a lot of interesting tastes that resonate with me, but at the same time it can be deep and challenging, making me wander in my head. It has a lot going on, and you really should try it for yourself. With this type of blend, you kind of… travel, it is beautiful, really.

Recommended readings:
This time it is hard, because it is a demanding smoke. You really shouldn’t read anything if you are trying this for the first time, just smoke it. By the 5th bowl, you can get “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket” on audiobook and pretend you are listening.

I thank you for your patience and would like to confront the supervillain of this sub, u/antiwittgenstein . Your evil deeds will not go unpunished! I volunteer as tribute in your twisted games! (Just to be clear, you are a cool and generous guy and I am trying to apply to the review contest)

zero-hunter: Excellent review. My sister wrote her MA thesis on Pym as a forerunner to later postmodern novels of the mid-20th century. I, too, think it's a very strange, very good novel. As for the tobacco, there are some tins of it just fermenting at my local B&M. Looks like I'll be picking them up. Best of luck to you in the contest. Stonehaven is one of the best blends ever made.
