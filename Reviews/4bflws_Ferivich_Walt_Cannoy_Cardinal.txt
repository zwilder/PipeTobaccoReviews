Walt Cannoy Cardinal House Morton Series Review

When Walt offered the chance to get the 30% off one of his Cardinal House pipes for an unbiased review I thought it would be a wise time to grab one as they had been intriguing me for a little while. The pipe that I purchased was int he Morton series, retailing for $219.00 USD + shipping.

I had a great time buying from Walt, someone had purchased the pipe that I also purchased a few seconds before I did, Walt was incredibly fast with the refund, an apology and helping me get another pipe within five minutes. Customer service like that is probably the reason I'll be buying again in this series.

Onto the review!

I ended up grabbing the BillDog (billiard with a bowldog like bowl)


This rusticated BillDog weighs 39 grams. It is 5.75 in. long, and 2 in. tall, with a 0.73 in. diameter by 1.75 in. deep chamber. It features an ivory acrylic band and a hand-cut NYH Ebonite stem.

First off the pipe came incredibly well packed inside two boxes with bubble wrap and a nice pipe sock, I had no concerns about any pipe damage on opening the package and was not surprised to find that it arrived without a single mark on it.

The pipes bowl was coated, which I'm generally not a fan of, but this coating only seemed to leave a small taste for the first few bowls that I smoked through it and then it was gone. I've smoked VaPers, a standard English and Burley Flake #4 through this pipe and not that it's broken in a little bit the bowl actually handles all these tobacco's quite well and seems to do a really solid job of insulating the tobacco so that the flavours carry through regardless of how hard I've been smoking the pipe.

The fit and finish on the pipe was spectacular, I don't see any light gap on the stem into the shank, no odd spots in the rustication and the staining looks to have taken everywhere. This pipe is super light for a pipe of it's size.

The rustication on the pipe is unlike any other rustication that I have personally felt, it reminds me a lot of lava rock and it's quite comfortable in the hand, It's not overly rough but not too smooth so that it feels like it'll slip in your hand.

The stem and button are incredibly comfy. Walt's buttons are small, which makes the experience when the stem is between your teeth quite nice. This is also the only complaint I have with the pipe, and it's a complaint unique to myself and not the pipe. I'm a clencher and I clench far back in my jaw, I like a bit larger of a button because the pipe feels more secure. With the smaller button I get nervous about it falling out from my teeth.

With the above being said I still love the pipe, but find I do less hands on things while smoking it, instead of enjoying it while I cook, or type on my PC/do work I'll drift outside and read a book and get back to what really got me into pipe smoking to begin with, the chance to slow my life down for an hour at a time and enjoy the pleasant smoke that we all enjoy.

The biggest test for me is what pipe do I go back to and want to smoke most often, and the answer is quite simple, it's this pipe. It smokes cool, dry and sweet and puts a smile on my face every time I light it up.

I would not hesitate to pay $219+ for another pipe in this series going forward, and I plan to. Walt's done a great job making the pipe not just a great smoking instrument but with the rustication keeping it almost organic feeling, which outside of some of my meerschaum pipes I find a lot of pipes in my collection lack.

If you were looking for a pipe in this price point I'd bid you to consider the Cardinal House pipes. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

If I was to give a numerical rating it would be a solid 8.75/10 (10 being impossible to achieve). It's the pipe I find my hand going to most often and at an average of ~55 minutes a bowl it fits the time slot of a smoke I'm looking for.

My phone/tablet are dead but I'll try and get some pictures up before Tuesday night (March 22, EDT).
====================================
GanDuff: I still don't see any pictures, Ferivich. Also, you shouldn't use a 10 point rating if the 10 is unachievable, just saying. I say that because this is obviously a subjective rating, but a 10/10 pipe should be something you can find/own one day, and it shouldn't be an impossible number that's never meant to be reached; why have it if it won't be used?

Anyway, mini rant aside, nice review.
