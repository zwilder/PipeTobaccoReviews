Tobacco Review: C&D Oriental Silk
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #56

**Blend Name:** Cornell and Diehl Oriental Silk

**Description on Tin:** For Cornell & Diehl's Oriental Silk combines Perique, bright flake, Turkish flake, and bright Virginia ribbon to create a remarkably elegant and sophisticated smoke.
 
**Leaf:** Coarse, chunky, fat yellow ribbon
 
**Tin Aroma:** Tangy and musty. Vinegar, wet dog, basement, rain, earth, 
 
**Taste:** Intensely salty and spicy on the front. Piney, salty, peppery. Woody and creamy. Flowery notes under the pepper like good Perique does. Cream and pepper are the forefront but underneath there is a sharp tang. White vinegar. Sweetness buried deep underneath. Now savoury bits. Onion and garlic, more salty. Old bay seasoning anyone? Something exotic about this, real oriental flavor.  Red wine vinegar, sulfites and tannins. Loads of lemon, juice and peel. Wood.  Heavy cream. A sharp transition from the tang to the wood and cream. It is all of the sudden barrel aged milk. Is that a thing? I hope not. A touch of smoke. Deepening richness, elegant. Cream and cedar to the end.

**Nicotine:** I feel very sleepy after half a bowl. Lids drooping. Vision darkened. Not quite OJK, Black Irish X territory, but quite powerful.

**Smokability:** Classic C&D dry. The big dry chunks avail themselves to easy packing through a gravity feed a bit of a thumb squish. Smokes cool, but seems to always be on the edge of going out. Nice oily mouthfeel, a bit like a cigar. Pretty, white ash if that is important to you.
 
**Room Note:** Lightly woodsy.

**Thoughts:** My first oriental blend without Latakia. Not as bright and dynamic as some of the Balkan blends I so enjoy – Balkan Saseini, Bosphrous Cruise – but quite phenomenal nonetheless. I really need to dig into those McClelland Grand Orientals I scored so I can talk about this with more education. 

**Similar Tobaccos:** Balkan Saseini, C&D Mountain Camp

**Summary:** A umami laden cream and cedar oriental blend. 

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: McClellands Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**+++

====================================
pixeechick: Looking forward to another bowl of this soon! And, like you, I should get into the Grand Oriental series. The Drama is apparently quite, quite nice. 

Thanks for another thorough review. I'll have to keep better notes next time and get my own review of this up.

soymilkisgood: Thanks for the review! Looks tasty. I prefer orientals with Latakia but this is something I think I should try.

Man, I really need to try Orlik Golden Sliced, it's on practically everyone's top tobaccos.  I have tried their Dark Strong Kentucky flakes, and they were great.
--
antiwittgenstein: Yes, if you are a Virginia fan you owe it to yourself to try it. It is a standard for good reason.
--
anderronshi: /u/bonehed pmed me and already sent me some in the mail today!  What a great guy.
--
antiwittgenstein: That guy...

====================================
WallyOh: I will say that I your description of the tin note and taste are so interesting to me. I would not think that vinegar, wet dog, and basement would be appealing. I have no experience really with orientals, but this sounds so interesting.  
--
antiwittgenstein: The musty doesn't really come through on the taste, thankfully. I drink a bit of scotch and frequently have to resort to describing the nose with otherwise pejorative aromatic notes, e.g. bandaids, burnt rubber, dead fish.

====================================
None: Haven't tried that one, sounds good, thanks.
