[Review] Solani - 656: Aged Burley Flake
By: crimblade

**Blend Name:** Solani - 656: Aged Burley Flake

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** A skillful mixture of three aged Burley's - dark brown Burley from Kentucky, light Burley from Brazil, and white Burley from Malawi - Southeast Africa. A very natural blend with absolutely no additives or flavors - a true Burley blend.

**Leaf:** Burley. Flake Cut. Dark brown leaf with the occasional lighter spots of color.

**Tin Aroma:** Cocoa, dark rich cocoa.

**Taste:** Silky Chocolate with a hint of nut. Deep rich and consistent throughout. Smooth on the retrohale, with the same bready chocolate. Slightly sweet but not so much that it sticks out. Consistent in a way I don't usually expect.

**Smokability:** A bit moist out of the tin which is to be expected from a flake cut, drying for 30 minutes is all that's really needed. Fold and Stuff with this blend is an exercise in frustration and constant relights. Rubbed out it smokes like a dream, puffed gently relights are far and in between and you're looking at at least an hour of smoke time. This is not a cold weather smoke for outdoor smokers simply because of it's slow burn.

**Room Note:** Smokey tobacco. More akin to a cigar than a cigarette, very pleasant without any real defining trait, this is what pipe smoke should smell like.

**Thoughts:** Aged Burley Flake is wonderful smoke. I believe it's the only full burley blend so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to at this point unfortunately. It's a good easy burn with a flavor consistency to match. It's one I pull out when I have nothing to do for the evening and am just looking for something to enjoy while reading a book, listening to a podcast, or some other recreational sitting activity. I think my only complaint with the blend is actually with that consistency. Throughout the smoke there is not real flavor change up between the top of the bowl to the bottom. This isn't a major thing, but sometimes it's nice to have that changing flavor as the smoke progresses. The Nic hit isn't major, I'd say somewhere just under medium. It keeps you at a nice contented state.

**Recommend to:** Anyone looking to get an intro to Burleys, it will leave you wanting to try more.

**Summary:** If you enjoy simple flavor profiles but always wanted them to be a little more forward this is a great smoke with a good room note as an added bonus. This blend was a great intro to Burleys for me simply because it was so good straight away. This is one of the few blends where I have a second tin in my cellar simply because it's one I would rather not run out of when I want for it. 

**Drink Pairings:**  Cider, not hard cider, just good cold pressed cider. Water, milk really makes this one shine. A good sencha green tea really makes this blend pop in interesting ways.

**Final Rating:** 3.5/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 3 years. My current favorites are Frog Morton's Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.

misterzipp0: Great review! I'm hoping to see more reviews this year from everyone seeing as how everyone keeps showing off what they have in their cellars! :)

This is a blend that I've got a small amount of that keeps eluding me taste wise. I know it's there but I haven't found the magic prep/pack/pipe combo yet.

crimblade: I'd love to do more reviews! However it's cold outside which means my 1-2 smokes a week is now down to maybe one abbreviated smoke a week. That being said I have a couple on my list of blends to review so hopefully this spring/summer I'll be able to get some more up, possibly with more frequency than the 1 every 2-3 months I have been doing.

I've had the best results with rubbing it out in my Peterson poker. Not a complete rub out mind you, that way I an have a nice mix of bigger pieces and small bits. It's alright in my Country Gentleman Cob but it's a much shallower flavor that comes out. Actually come to think of it it shines pretty nicely in my big clay pipe too so at least for me tall chambered pipes seem to really do it for the blend.
