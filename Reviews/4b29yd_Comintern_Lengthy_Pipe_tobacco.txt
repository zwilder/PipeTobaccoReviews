Lengthy Pipe tobacco Review: Esoterica Penzance
By: Comintern
---
Good evening everyone, I cracked open my tin of Penzance about a week ago and I haven't been able to put it down since so I figured a review would be appropriate.


**Age:** I bought this tin a couple months ago although the tobacco came out with a significant amount of crystallization. I have no idea how long Germain ages these before they go out but it seems like a pretty good amount of time.

**Cut:** Sliced crumble cake. It comes in super delicate short flakes cut off of a crumble cake. They fall apart if you so much as look at them funny. And they're incredibly soft, they feel and look like slices of moist chocolate brownie.

**Smokability:** The flakes come incredibly moist out of the tin and you're gonna need significant drying time before you can realistically light them up. However if you rub some out it will break down into very small pieces and dry relatively quickly. Also there's really no tongue bite to worry about and it smokes very cool.

**Prep Method:** I've smoked a couple of bowls pretty well rubbed out and it's smoked really well. I've also tried stuff a flake into a bowl and putting some rubbed out stuff on top and it smoked for an incredibly long time but required much more babying and relights.

**Tin Note:** There's some of the smoky latakia ou'd expect with a bit of a sourness from the orientals. However there's a special aged mustiness that seems unique to Penzance. It reminds me of mushrooms growing on a rotting log on a wet fall day. Which seems crazy but sort of makes sense.

**Taste:** Balance is really the name of the game with this blend. It starts with a really perfumey Lat presence but there's some underlying sweetness from the virginias. There's a definite Umami sort of note as well that seems a bit musty and ancient. As you move down the bowl there's a wonderful chocolate biscuit note that comes and goes throughout and this flavour is what really sets the blend apart for me. You'll also get a bit of sour saltiness or even the tiniest bit of spice from the orientals at times but it never really overtakes any other element of the blend.

It's just a great balance between sweet and savoury characteristics that keeps you coming back for more.  

**Verdict:** It's good. It's really really good. I mean it seems almost silly to say that one of the most sought after blends currently in production is good but goddamn I like this stuff. And I don't even smoke English blends very often. I like this more than any others I've had although I'm quite partial to Westminster.

**Background on me:** I've been smoking for around a year now. I'm mostly a Virginia/Perique or Virginia/Kentucky smoker. I smoke English blends as well but much more rarely.

**My Top 5:** I mean these could change on any given day but here's the list

1: GL Pease Sixpence

2: Escudo Navy De Luxe

3: Penzance

5: GL Pease Jackknife Plug
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice write up, clear and straightforward - though it seems cruel to review this one as it is so hard to get ahold of. Keep the reviews coming pipemate.

Comintern: Thanks, my fiancee's out of town for a week so I told myself I'd take the time to get some reviews done.

====================================
None: Stonehaven is even better.

Comintern: probably, but it's hard to find a bag that I can buy for a reasonable price and then get shipping to canada at a reasonable price. Also it would take me forever to get through 8 ounces of anything. It takes me like 6 months to get through 2 ounces. I'll probably pull the trigger on it down the road.

None: Yeah, the living in Canada part makes it difficult to do anything.
