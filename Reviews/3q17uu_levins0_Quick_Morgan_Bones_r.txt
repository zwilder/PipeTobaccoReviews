Quick Morgan Bones review

I smoked a quick half-bowl of Carter Hall this morning.  It's actually a pretty good smoker.  

I have four "beater" pipes: this Bones, an unfinished Savinelli panelled billiard, and two Comoy's of London that I got from "Goodystore" on eBay.  All were under $50 shipped.

I like the Comoy's stems the best.  They are very thin and the button is the smallest of the factory pipes I have.  However, the bowls are on the small side, and the walls are thin so they heat up quite a bit.  They gurgle a lot, too, but a quick swipe with a pipe cleaner fixes it, so it's tolerable.

The Savinelli and the Bones are about on par.  The stems are thick and the buttons are big, which is probably better if you clench.  I don't, so they're bigger than I like, but not horrible.  I deliberately tried to get the Bones to gurgle, and it just started to but then cleaned up its act, so the engineering seems pretty good on it.

====================================
Mordenkrad: It looks to me like the Bones pipes (from the ones I've seen inside the bowls)  are drilled low and their airways are  not funneled. So you basically get the pipe mechanics you'd get buying a Rossi or any other lower budget briar, but you get added cosmetic flaws and a neat logo.

They seem okay.

levins0: Pretty much. I haven't smoked it enough to make a final decision. I own a couple of budget Rossi Rubinos. Considering the problems I've had with the finishes bubbling, I'm pretty meh about them, though LDG has stood solidly behind their product and replaced the problem pipes.

Right now I would say they smoke about the same. 

And yeah, there are definitely flaws in the briar. I kind of like the look. Morgan didn't advertise these as anything but factory seconds, and so far I'd say they are about on par with other cheap briar. Fact is the Rossi and my unfinished Savinelli have flaws, too, but they filled them and, on the Rossi, covered them with stain.
