Haunted Bookshop Review

Ordered a bunch of different 1oz burley blends to try out to see if anything could dethrone CH to me. 

First up is c&d's haunted Bookshop. 

Packed it in my beater basket pipe while walking the dog and it lit up with no problems. Strong burley backbone w that familiar cocoa base. Didn't realize this blend had some perique but it quickly shows up on the retrohale.  Adds a little back of the throat tartness and black pepper spice to balance out the burley. 

There's a slight medicinal taste - or maybe that's the ghost of CH bowls past? Haven't quite put my finger on it yet but tasting a bit of cherry in there as well. 

No nic hit noticeable for me. YMMV. 

Good stuff, I likes 4/5 hotdogs. 
====================================
FullFrontalNoodly: How can you not realize this has plenty of perique?  Also, I'm a nic heavyweight and I can feel the nic in this one.

Never gotten any cherry or chocolate from this one, pretty sure they both are ghosts from previous bowls.

adamdenton1: Didn't realize there was perique when I ordered as I just went down the list selecting 1 ounce of known burley blends. Knew it as soon as I lit it up tho. 

Burley to me has a nutty and cocoa flavor. Not chocolate but more like unsweetened cocoa. Maybe it's just me, I dunno. Cherry and medicinal flavors may very well be ghosts. 

Didn't feel any nicotine hit.

badmongo666: Yeah this one kicked my ass pretty hard and I'm not a lightweight with vitamin N either. I prefer OJK and smoke that instead. 
--
adamdenton1: Yea ojk hit me when I smoked it about 6 months ago but didn't get anything from this. Maybe those chicken and dumplings for dinner paid off.

cmdr_andrew_dermott: Ordered some, knowing I hate Perique. Fully expect I won't like it, but I wanted to try anyway...
--
adamdenton1: Yea, it's for sure there. Seems to me to taste a little less "spicy" with the burley than VA/per blends. maybe that will help. 
--
cmdr_andrew_dermott: Here's hoping. It's the overwhelming, ever-building black pepper nonsense that turns me off on it. I find my throat and sinuses get to... burning isn't the right word, since it's more of a scent than pain. But it's like being stuck with pepper up your nose. Blegh.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: The one you are wanting here is Three Friars.  It is fairly similar to Haunted Bookshop with less perique.

chewsyourownadv: Pro tip: if it doesn't sit well with you, toss it in a jar and forget about it for 3 or 4 months. Try it again, and if it's still unruly let it sit another couple of months, for a total of around 6 months.

C&D burley, and perhaps perique, is notorious for being unruly when it's fresh. It really needs some time to calm down.
