Species 8472, a drunken review. (Resistance is futile.)

Ever watch an episode of "Drunk History"? Well, I'm using that template for my review. 

Yes, I said "Species 8472". My fellow Star Trek fans will get the joke when I reveal this blends true name. It is called properly "Blend D-7485" by L.J. Peretti. I like my misnomer better. It gives character to a lovely blend. 

**What does it look like?** Tobacco! What did you expect? A Faberge egg? Ribbon cut black and brown. 

**What does it smell like?** I dunno. Hasperat, raktaijino and plomeek broth. All sarcasm aside. I don't know. It came in a plastic baggie that seems to have been steeped in every tobacco known to man. 

**How does it pack?** Like Ferengi at a Dabo table. (Easy)

*Are you done with the Star Trek jokes?* Is a Klingon logical?

*Sigh*  **How does it smoke?** Like the burning wreckage of a Borg cube in Sector 001. By that, I mean it is very satisfying. It is one the mildest and coolest English blends I've encountered. It has a lovely almost floral note to the Latakia smokiness. Smooth and almost creamy. Like a Vulcan, I can't entice it to strong negative emotion. This is good stuff. 

I hope you enjoyed my review. If not, blame /u/BIG_BLACK_COFFEE, he gave it to me.
