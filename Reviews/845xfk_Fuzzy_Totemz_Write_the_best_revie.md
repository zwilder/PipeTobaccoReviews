Write a review at smokingpipes.com, PM me after to let me know it's yours.  
  
Friday evening I will declare a winner.  
  
Be aware:   
1. This is not an excuse to spam Smoking Pipes with obscene content. Obscenity is an automatic disqualifier.  
2. Must be creative, low effort will be ignored.  
3. Must not be reliant on a subreddit in-joke for greatness.  A wink or nod is okay, but it can't just be "this graped me right in the mouth! /signed"  
4. Reviews are displayed weirdly, they truncate automatically. Make your review fit within 240 characters for people to see it completely. Brevity is good. If it goes beyond 240 it makes an ellipsis. You can use this to your advantage if you are clever (like doing to 241 characters with a period to have it add an ellipsis to your review).  Planting an easter egg or something clever in the 'read more' part won't work in your favor unless the review encourages me to click the "read more".  So if you do a setup/payoff with the 'read more', make me want to 'read more'.  
  
Info: **Zombeh Kake** is based on a blend I got a large allocation of that was an underappreciated sleeper while it lived. It was a resurrection of a resurrection of a resurrection. So me remastering this resurrection is pretty damn meta. It's Burley with condimental virginia, latakia, and perique; aged to a good point before I remastered it. It has a bit of premium booze applied with a light hand.  Finally, I pressed it into a kake with the new ingredients blended in.  *Zombeh Kake is not something I'm selling*.

antiwittgenstein: Now I regret not adding the grape to my cart during IPSD as I was sorely tempted to.

feernot: Whoever makes me laugh with inside jokes that doesn’t win Fuzzy’s contest, will get something from me.

Fuzzy_Totemz: You already tried to win your own contest! I saw the entry.  
  
I was worried out mods here would remove my post if I encouraged what seemed to be shitposts at SP since Laudisi has been good to this subreddit sponsoring a few of our contests.  
  
I don't endorse feernots meta contest. ::wink::

Bragisson: I went to write a review, read yours, and exited the page. Never will I ever compete with such excellent shit posting.

AnimageCGF: I can't wait to read reviews people do.

Taco_Tasker: is it either/or with regards to the 1.5 and 12oz listings or does it need to be a certain one?
