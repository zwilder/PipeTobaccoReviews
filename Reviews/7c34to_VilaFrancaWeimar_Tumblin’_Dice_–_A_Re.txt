Tumblin’ Dice – A Review
By: VilaFrancaWeimar
---
There is an absolutely fantastic poem by Charles Bukowski called “Roll the Dice”. A poem that speaks to us about “gambling” in a sense, going all the way, risking all you have for the possibility of achieving perfection, or beauty, or even basking in your failure in a worst case scenario. I don’t mean to wax poetic, but I would like to take this review as an opportunity to say to each and every one of you, do it! Buy that pretty pipe you have set your eyes on, ask that girl out, and get to that book that seems too challenging! Life is but a gamble, sometimes you roll the dice and you get a perfect six, other times you comically (or tragically, what is the difference?) get a one, but most of the times you get something in between.

Tumblin’ Dice is a Va/Per produced by Dan Tobacco. I swear I am not receiving any payments from said company. It has kind of a novelty feel to it, because it is a cube cut, which is kind of rare from this side of the Atlantic. Now, I am not a big Va/Per guy, so take this criticism with a grain of salt and realize, please, that my subjective experience might not be yours, and that you should always see for yourself. This might be a slightly shorter critique than the previous since I don’t really have too much to say.

Before the smoke:
Cool tin art, almost cowboy styled. The smells are pleasant, but not overtly rich. Hay like, but sweeter. I can’t really pick up much more, but it smells natural, so that is just great when compared to most of what is for sale in the market. The cubes are kind of a pain to get used to, I packed them too tight in the beginning, but when you get the hang of it it’s enjoyable.

Beginning of the smoke:
It’s kind of hard to light but easy to keep lit. I’m kind of sensitive to Perique (even though I handle spicy foods better than Hillary Clinton) which forced me to smoke slower than I normally would. This turned out to be a good thing, since when smoked with a slow pace it can be a real cool smoke for this type of blend.   

During the smoke:
As a Va/Per it’s sweet, but not too sweet. Spicy, but not to an excess. I just guess that it has nothing really very characteristic about it. You can look at it as goldilocks territory, or as bland, it really depends on what you like. It doesn’t challenge you *per se*, so it makes it kind of a fun tobacco instead of a contemplative one. It really stays the same the whole bowl, so if you like consistency and dislike surprises, this one is for you.

After the smoke:
The beard note is pleasant enough as any Virginia, and it won’t follow you around. I wouldn’t consider the room note particularly strong as well, but people have said the opposite.

Overview: 
Look, I want to be fair, and I really want to like this blend, and trust me, it is a good one, so don’t skip on buying this just because a reddit asshole didn’t love it. This is actually a good one, tastes natural and sweet at the same time, has an edge because of the Perique, has a cool type of cut… It just isn’t for me. Would I recommend it? Sure. Would I buy it again? Probably not. Would I smoke it if it was offered to me? Of course, why not, in a night out with the boys? This is a simple, fun, unpretentious blend, and if you like Va/Pers you will probably like it a lot more than I did. Just throw that dice and see what you get, and let me know if you liked it.

Recommended readings:
-“The Gambler” by Dostoyevsky. Pretty good, but definitely not his best. 

-Why not those beautiful Bukowski poems? 

Thank you for your patience! Hey u/antiwittgenstein , I know I can’t win this contest with quality alone, so I am submitting a second review and going for quantity.

antiwittgenstein: Good review, good you chose something that is good not great. Can you compare this one to other VaPers? Sounded quite a bit like my feelings towards Dunhill Elizabethan, perfectly serviceable, even good, something I like to take to parties and such, but nothing I will get a tattoo of.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Yes, in many ways it works a lot like Elizabethan, but it isn't as sweet and I would say, personally, it has a better and more natural tasting after-taste. Not to downplay Elisabethan, which is a great tobbacco, but it is very comparable. Maybe when it comes to  Va/Per's in general, I just don't "like like" them. I really would't get a tumblin' dice tramp stamp, but it is great to take to parties, as you said. Thanks!
