Tambolaka review and impressions from first smoke(s).

Just as fall rolls around and I am getting ready to jump back into my pipe habit, I had the chance to trade a kind redditor for some Tambolaka.  This is a tobacco variety that I have heard about but never had the opportunity to try until now.  Well, I loaded some into my carved Meerschaum pipe, "Boris the bulldog" because it has a small bowl and to get the pure flavor.  I smoked a couple of bowls this weekend.

The tobacco came in what looked like beef jerky strips and smelled tobacco-ish but with a dark, not quite smoky, scent.  It was rather easy to crumble and pack and the moisture content was perfect to smoke right off.  The bowl took several delights, but I find this little pipe goes out a good bit anyway.

The first puff as I lit it was not terribly different from some of the brown ropes I like, but with a rich and mellow yet "light" or "thin" aftertaste.  It is hard to pin down because the flavor is deep but it does not linger on my tongue very long.  I found the strength pretty similar to the brown rope I mentioned, maybe a bit more potent; I did get the *niccups* about halfway through each time.

As the bowl continued, the potency seemed to increase and the flavor was good and robust but the "thin" quality I mentioned stayed.  As soon as the smoke left my mouth or nose, the aftertaste dissipated.  This is not unpleasant in the least, just unique.  My comparison stays the same, it is very similar to Gawith brown ropes, it has a bit of the smoothness of the black ones, but without the heavy aftertaste.  There is also a sort of nutty undertone to it.

Overall I like this tobacco and am glad to have tried it.  Going forward, I think I will try blending it with some McClelland "Classic Samsun" because that one also has a nutty flavor and I think it might harmonize well and add a bit more depth to the smoke.  I also use this blend to cut my brown ropes sometimes.  A good tobacco and it did not end up being quite the untamed beast that I imagined from reading some of the reviews of it on other sites.

Cheers.
====================================
givemeyours0ul: I also found similarity with the brown and black ropes, but with an additional vegetal foulness. 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Hmmm, maybe vegetable is a good way to describe it, in the sense that some English teas are said to have a "vegetable soup" tone; I did not find it foul at all though but I like the beastly stuff anyway.
--
givemeyours0ul: I need to smoke more of it. I'm also sure it varies wildly from stick to stick. 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: The sample I got was sealed in a bag but had already been flaked out, not in the bundled stick.  Dunno if that makes a difference.  
--
givemeyours0ul: I mean, not really. I'm just thinking you have villagers make the sticks and put them under their huts for 5 years, this isn't exactly a scientific production process. 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Ohhh, yeah true that.  Maybe you got a pack from the villager all the locals call "stinky" lol.

====================================
NegativeOffset: You should grape it. For science!
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I'm waiting for someone to create a "Will it Grape?" youtube channel...


--
Occams-shaving-cream: I must be out of the loop?  How does one "grape it"?
--
NegativeOffset: Mix it with Capt. Black Grape. It's _a thing_.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Well, it's a *reddit* thing, at least, along with leather pipe mats.


--
Occams-shaving-cream: ... I'm sorry, I threw up a little bit.  Grape?  Did they not think that regular Cptn Black was disgusting enough!?
--
NegativeOffset: That's part of the mystique of graping.

Occams-shaving-cream: Before asking if we *can* do it, perhaps it is better to ask if we *should* do it, lol

Edit:  Btw, that was interesting but for the love of God, watching that video made me feel like I was listening to my gf tell me a story about something that happened to her during the day; I just want to shake the guy and yell "Enough talking about minute details!  Get to the freaking point!!"  Okay, maybe that rant was excessive.

_TheMightyKrang_: Honey, I don't think you understand, Aunt Karen was being *such* a bitch! 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Lol, more like "Honey, you won't believe what Aunt Karen did!  You see this morning I called her and we talked about meeting for lunch, she said that she couldn't take lunch until 1:00, so I told her that would work because my schedule is flexible.  So then when we were taking I told her about blah blah blah and she said blah blah. Well then it was time for lunch and I clocked out and got in my car.  I drove to the restaurant, we picked Applebees because she likes it and it is close to the interstate but we went to the one across town, not the one by the mall because blah blah blah.  Anyway, she was telling me about her daughter and I told her that at my job I was working on blah blah blah and she said blah blah and I said blah blah then she said blah blah and I was like blah blah blah and then she said..... [and another 15 minutes before *actually telling me what Aunt Karen did*].
