A quick review of ezoterica blackpool.

I bought this blend, along with a few others from the marque at Tinderbox when I noticed that they had some available, 1oz of each of the blends.  Let me start by saying that this one was the black sheep of the lot.

While Dorchester, Dunbar and Peacehaven all had this intoxicating honey like sweet fragnace and delicate soft leaves, this stuff smelled more like licorice, as it should since that is what it is flavored with, and was dark and hard and looked like black tea dipped in tar.  In fact, after smoking this foul concoction, I think Blackpool is an apt name as it recalls the tar pits the dinosaurs fell into.

Moving on to smoking, the moisture of this leaf was hard to guage as it truly is an odd, almost rubbery leaf.  I set it out to dry for about 20 minutes and then rolled I a bit in my fingers to fluff it out and loaded it into a small meer that I use for tasting.

The licorice scent was not particularly observable in the smoke, in fact, nothing much was.  It seemed a bit bitter and left an odd feeling on my tongue, not so much bite, more like a slight novacaine feeling and off taste.  I assume that this was from the topping.  The first bowl and subsequent ones did not take flame well, the twig lime texture of the tobacco and tar coating made it hard to fluff out.  I spent more time relighting this stuff than smoking it would seem.

If did not produce mu h smoke or flavor, and that off feeling on my tongue became more and more bothersome, very chemical feeling.

In the several times that i have given this stuff another chance, i yet yet to get it to burn through an entire bowl, including after leaving it out for 12 hours.  The coating seems to keep the moisture levels from changing at all.

In the end my best guess of the production method is that they take the leaf, fill a traditional calabash chamber with it, and proceed to smoke a pound or two of a licorice aromatic through the pipe.  The resulting product is Esoterica Blackpool.

I do not recommend this stuff.

Ifuckinglovepron: Hey, sorry I missed your comment, I actually gave it to a friend a while ago, just felt like finally putting up a review.  Kinda had an IDE to make reviews about tobacco I strongly dislike in addition to all the ones for stuff people like.

Next up:  Frog Morton On the Bayou...  Imho a very weak one in the series.  Admittedly Frog's Cellar is a love it or hate it, but On the Bayou just has something off to me.

Foz594: So I am unclear here, are you saying this was bad or good? :)

GanDuff: I'm a big licorice fan, so I'm still intrigued by this tobacco.

majkeli: I did not like Blackpool at all, couldn't even finish the tin.  Heinrich's Dark Strong Flake is nice if you want a little licorice flavor.
