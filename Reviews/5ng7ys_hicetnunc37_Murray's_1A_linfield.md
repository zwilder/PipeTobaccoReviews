Murray’s 1A Linfield


cut: ribbon


tin aroma: floral/ latakia


body: medium full


strenght: medium


nicotine: medium


taste: I wanted to try this becaause Murray’s was such iconic and reputable blender. This is your typical lat bomb in style of Penzance or Bengal slices. Unlike Penzance, I was pleasantly surprised by the nic hit, its on par with mm965. If I was smoking this blend blindfolded and did not know whats inside the pipe, I would guess Bengal Slices. This is fairly new to the U.S. market. While I will not order this again because of its similarity to superior, IMO, blends; I must say its solid. A bit of harshness from what appears to me a very young Virginia leaf, but solid nonetheless. Basically, if you buy it you’ll probably end up smoking it. Blended by lane limited.
====================================
givemeyours0ul: Question. You say blindfolded you would say Bengal Slices. Does this replicate the strong incenses taste/smell of Bengal then?

hicetnunc37: yes it does in my opinion.

givemeyours0ul: Interesting. I'll have to try it, I love Bengal!
