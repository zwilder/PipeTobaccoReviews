Tobacco Review : Eileen's Dream
By: DrScience11
---
***Coming Soon :Erinmore Flake, Ennerdale Flake, McConnell's Scottish Cake!***


**Blend Name**: Eileen's Dream

**Description on Tin**:Inspired by CAO's flavorful Eileen's Dream Cigarillos, this blend begins with a base of quality Virginia leaf and then infuses the same with a frothed cream that's been laced with superior Irish whiskey and coconut milk, followed by a subtle mixture of hazelnut paste, ground almonds, cocoa and vanilla 

**Looks**: Surprisingly Dark Ribbons, mixed in with lighter ones more reminiscent of Virginia.

**Smells**: Extremely sweet. A dark sweetness that made me think this blend contains black Cavendish. The sweetness is almost sickly sweet, and really overpowering.  Theres a hint of an alcohol in the sweetness, like whiskey. 

**Taste**: Very mild, soft notes throughout.  The sweetness is very played down from the misleading tin scents, and is very mellow similar to a burley.  There are some earthy notes of cocoa and truffle, which underly the mild, almost tasteless base.  There are some notes of the Irish Creme, though it doesn't have the darker caramel/coffee tastes I was expecting. It is more reminiscent of straight whiskey tobacco flavors. 

**Compare to** : Whiskey and cocoa flavored aromatics.

**Summary**: It's...well. Lets put it this way. When I saw the description, Irish creme and white truffles, I got very, very excited.  Smoking this blend was...disappointing. It's possible I built it up in my mind, but after smoking it again, I am confident it's just bland.  There's nothing bad here, no detriments, but it's just not spectacular in any way. The truffle and cocoa notes aren't prominent enough, the irish cream notes are not dark and bold enough, the flavors not prominent enough, the whole thing is just that, not enough.  This is an ok tobacco if you like mild blends, that aren't overwhelming. But for someone like me, who adores bold flavors and complex tastes, this just falls short.  Solid C. 

**Rating : 2.5 / 5**

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak and Dunhill's nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of English blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q. I've been piping for almost 7 months, and smoke frequently.

If you enjoy my reviews, let me know. Criticism appreciated! Also if you have a request, please ask.
====================================
thepipebit: Well done review. That's what happens when aromatics get to busy with too many different flavors.
--
pipeweed: It's not that there are too many flavors per se, it's just way too mild of a flavor IMO. It seems very plain, especially when one is expecting a creamy, truffle flavor. It's there...but *barely*.
--
TheMikey: I've experienced this with a local tobacco blender. Very wonderful scent from the bag (it's a loose tobacco) which has notes of irish cream and raisins. Unfortunately, this does not transfer over to the tobacco and I'm left with an incredibly bland smoke. It's not bad, it's just... not great. Frankly, I think that it's the same effect on the smoker as this review.

====================================
Smokebeard: Just to illustrate personal tastes, Eileen's Dream is one of my favorites, but I'm not into super strong tobaccos like DrScience. So aromatic lovers, don't be afraid to give it a shot if you can get your hands on it. It certainly is fairly mild, but you do get 'pockets' of thick flavor while smoking a full bowl. To each his own, and thanks to DrScience for always being super informative with fantastic reviews.
--
DrScience11: I whole heartily agree. Just because I don't like it doesn't mean someone else won't.  Hopefully I give a good enough description that people can decide if it's right for them.  
--
Smokebeard: Certainly so. I really appreciate the time and dedication you put into your reviews. I know smoking all that delicious tobacco can't be much fun for you, so thanks for doing the dirty work ;)
--
DrScience11: Yea it's a real burden. And thanks for the kind words!
--
pipeweed: Just for the sake of debate, I kind of disagree, even though I know there is a lot of subjectivity when it comes to taste/preferences. I thought this under-delivered on many levels and I would be very hesitant to recommend it (even to aromatic-lovers). It didn't live up to the advertised tin description, and it had *very* little flavor, even for someone like myself who enjoys nuanced flavors and mild aromatics. For those that enjoy aromatics, **there are much better options out there** (which are highly rated by hundreds of people) and I would encourage you and everyone else to explore them! I am, however, glad that you liked it!

====================================
ImoImomw: Thank you for the review. I figured there could be a chance for let down on this one, but as you described the tobacco I made some realizations.  First I love the Eileen's dream cigarillos, but I only love them because of the severe sweetness it leaves on my lips, and the smell of the unlit cigar.  The smoke is not complex in flavor or in aromatic quality.  Great review you saved me from buying it and being disappointed.
--
pipeweed: If you like sweet cigarillos, try the filtered version of [these](http://www.cheapcigarette.org/images/alcapone-sweets-filter.gif). They are fantastic!
--
ImoImomw: Thank you very much I will most definitely give them a go.

====================================
geese: Wow this was definitely on my "to buy" list but I guess it can wait. Thanks for the review!
--
====================================
Sixpints: How was the room note, if ya dont mind me asking?
--
DrScience11: It was alright. Mellow and sweet, but not amazing like blue note /1Q. It was very much like the taste, uneventful. 
--
pipeweed: I got a few compliments, but nothing out of the ordinary.

====================================
DavidPx: Thanks for providing a reality check on that tin description!
