Autumn Tobacco review Pt.2 

* Along with my haul of autumn tobaccos I bought a Missouri Meerschaum ozark hardwood maple pipe, all of these autumn tobaccos will be smoked in this, and I hope the flavors don’t get too muddled with one another. I should also mention I am not that experienced with pipe tobacco. 

**Russ’s Blends - Apple Fritter**

The tobacco itself - Very nice consistency, good sized pieces of leaf and a nice rich, dark brown. The smell is divine, a nice sweet apple scent with some spice. However it seems just a tad bit dry. packing took a bit extra effort because it was a bit dry, but I got it packed down nicely. 

Smoking it - The dryness was definitely evident upon lighting my pipe, The top caught fire however it did mellow out after a bit. There was a hint of sweetness, but here it was extremely underwhelming. The name would suggest that it would be a delicious smoke, but I was not very satisfied. The spice taste was quite strong against any sweetness or apple flavor, giving a ‘burnt’ apple fritter taste. There was definitely a note of apple, but not as much as i’d hoped for. In addition, there a was a strong bit of bite, mostly on the top of my throat. Perhaps I was smoking too fast, but my pipe never got hot. As I inhaled there was quite a bit of nicotine which was nice. 

Final thoughts - Definitely not one of my favorites, 4/10. The spice was way too strong against any other flavor. Perhaps a bit more of whatever flavor used could have been added. 

**Russ’s Blends - Snow Drift**

The tobacco itself - The scent of this tobacco is lovely, evoking thoughts of a warm fire and hot cocoa. It also seems a bit less moist than desired, however it’s a good consistency, and a nice dark-chocolate color. Upon packing a bowl I realize that it is perhaps a bit too bulky, pieces of leaf (imo) should have been finer, but that’s just a small qualm I have. I also have to reiterate that while packing my pipe the delicious scent of chocolate and spice are strongly prevalent.  

Smoking it - Not too much trouble getting it lit, only had to tamp and light a few more times than usual. Upon puffing a few times you can definitely get a nice sweet/spice flavor with a good compliment of chocolate. However there was a bit to be desired as far as the sweetness goes (imo) because the spice was pretty strong. During my smoke I did get a noticeable amount of bite mostly at the roof of my mouth and a bit on my tongue, but not too much on my throat as I inhaled. However I may have been smoking fairly fast. This is definitely a mellow tobacco that I wish I could enjoy by a nice fire with a hot cup of cocoa.

Final thoughts - Snow Drift gets a good 6.5/10. A nice chocolate-spice flavor that could do with a bit more sweetness. I would recommend smoking this with a cup of hot cocoa.

**Russ’s Blends - Chocolate Covered Espresso Bean**

The tobacco itself - Straight away this tobacco has such a strong smell. Delicious chocolate smell with that coffee spice taste. It is a bit moist and bulky, which made packing my pipe rather difficult. I ended up packing my pipe too tightly and had a bit of trouble getting it lit and keeping lit. If I were to have packed it better, I would not have had this issue. 

Smoking it - Like I said, I had some difficulty getting it lit, but that was my fault. Right away you can taste a nice sweet chocolate flavor, but not too much coffee. I also got a considerable amount of bite on my tongue, throat and roof of my mouth. As I inhaled I was surprised by the sheer amount of nicotine in this blend. You definitely feel it in your throat and it hit me pretty hard, however I do like me some vitamin N. 

Final thoughts - Chocolate Covered Espresso Bean gets an 8/10. Not incredibly mellow, but good amount of sweet and nicotine. It also leaves you pipe smelling like burnt coffee (but in a good way)

**Hearth & Home - Caramel Apple Pie**

The tobacco itself - You can really smell a nice sweet caramel spice with a note of apple. The consistency is very nice, good sized pieces of leaf with a nice rich brown/black color. It’s hard for me to pinpoint the moisture, it seems a bit dry, but packing it makes me think it’s a bit too moist. Hard to discern and had a bit of trouble packing it, but nothing too bad.

Smoking it - Not difficult to light, didn’t seem too moist. However I was extremely displeased with this tobacco. My pipe didn’t heat up too much, however it must have been burning pretty hot because all I got was bite. I let it cool off a bit but there was still some bite. Along with that, the flavor wasn’t good. There was a sweet note but I couldn’t taste anything discernibly good. A bit of nicotine, but boy was this bad. 

Final thoughts - 3/10 is a stretch for this ‘Caramel Apple Pie’. Would not recommend this at all. Instead go with McClelland’s Fresh Apple for a sweet/mellow apple tobacco which is quite good

====================================
TheWierdAsianKid: Coming next in Pt.3 will be C&D Autumn Evening, Sutliff Pumpkin Spice, and Sutliff Private Stock Taste of Autumn. I also have an ounce of C&D Bayou Night coming so let me know if you want me to include that in my reviews.

Taldeaux: Its a tough job but somebodys gotta do it
--
TheWierdAsianKid: Aye, and sadly I burnt my tongue with some coffee a while back, luckily I won't *have* to smoke anything for a little while
--
jelbert6969: I want these reviews
--
TheWierdAsianKid: Should be here in a couple days, then it''s maybe take 2-3 days for the reviews. the Autumn evening is still back ordered however
--
jelbert6969: Gosh I like autumn evening, wondering how it contrasts to the others.

On a side note, can you recommend a strong cinnamon tobacco. Cinnamon roll by Russ was good just wondering if there is stronger.
--
TheWierdAsianKid: I have no idea, havn't had any other 'spice' tobaccos like cinnamon. It's definitely not close, but Russ's Chocolate covered esspresso bean is great, pretty strong too
--
====================================
bovinitysupreme: Russ is known for not making things too moist. For guys like me who prefer it dry that's an advantage, but I'll give you that having to dry it is realistic, while for those who prefer it more moist, hydrating it is not.

I was hoping for better results from those apple blends. I love Middleton apple and wouldn't mind trying some more artisanal apple blends, especially one named "Caramel Apple Pie", a name which sounds absolutely delicious.

That's a lot of inhaling!
--
TheWierdAsianKid: Yeah, I smoked cigs for a while but have stopped, only in the past month i have smoked a cig and it was this great rolling tobacco a british guy gave me that isn't available in america. So I am accustom to inhaling and nicotine. Anyway I seriously suggest the McClelland Fresh Apple tobacco
