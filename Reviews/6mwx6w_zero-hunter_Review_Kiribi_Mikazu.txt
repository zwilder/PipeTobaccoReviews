Review Kiribi Mikazuki First Impressions

[After a drawn-out snafu with P&C](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/6coxx7/another_pc_warning/), I received my Kiribi Mikazuki and have had it for about two months. I've used it steadily and thought I would post a quick "first impressions" review since I asked so many of you on here which pipe lighter I should buy. At the time, I narrowed my choices down to the [Kiribi Mikazuki](https://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/kiribi-mikazuki-lighters/1480401/), [the 4th Generation pipe lighter](https://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/4th-generation-pipe-lighter-lighters/1490026/), or the [Jifeng pipe lighter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/JIFENG-Lift-Arm-flint-butane-lighter-with-pipe-tamper-bronzy-Refillable-/171545990466?epid=1131817714&hash=item27f0f01542:g:mFoAAOxy4YdTTN8h) that can be bought on eBay.

The Mikazuki arrived much faster than I thought it would; after battling with P&C, I was convinced I'd never get it. I had to adjust the flame a lot lower than I thought since the full flame size is huge. The flame also holds up very well in the wind. In fact - and get this - in a side-by-side comparison between it and my Zippo, I found my Zippo blowing out more frequently than the Mikazuki. The Mikazuki's flame also held out longer in a breeze than did my Bic. I can only chalk this quirk up to the butane I use for the Mikazuki, which is [Vector](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Vector-14-x-Filtered-Butane-1-Can-320ml-10-6oz-Signature-/171540047421?epid=1348652573&hash=item27f095663d:g:nvYAAOSwMKpUY3gG).

The Mikazuki lights reliably, and the flame is consistent. I have only had to refill it once, and I smoke about once every two or three days. The Zippo, on the other hand, must be refilled every few days whether I use it or not. Thus, the Mikazuki has become my primary lighter. My Zippo's flame is temperamental; the Bic blows out too easily; and I need three hands for matches. But the Mikazuki, so far, is excellent. And, lo and behold, I re-ordered from P&C after swearing off them entirely (note, the products I ordered were not backordered).

My advice: if you're looking for your first pipe lighter, this is it. It's cheaper than the Old Boy and more consistent than cheaper alternatives. Fill it with good butane. Take care of it. And order it only from P&C if it isn't backordered. Otherwise, patronize other businesses.
====================================
hello_josh: I really like my Kiribi Kabuto. I used to prefer matches but the nice wide soft flame on the Kiribi is perfect. It lights almost every time on the first try. I would recommend it without hesitation.
