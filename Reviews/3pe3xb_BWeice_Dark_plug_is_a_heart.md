Dark plug is a hearty meal on a cold winters day

I cubed up some chunks of Dark Plug and tossed it in the pot and began a stewin'. I received a sample a while ago from /u/Bonehed and haven't had the chance to get around to it until this morning. Cold weather rolled in and I think its safe to say that it is here to stay, this to me is prime pipe smoking time. Don't get me wrong it's great year round but it warms me up in the colder months and makes me happy.

This plug is a Va/Bur and a damn good one at that. It has a nice rich leathery meat smell and taste. Slow smoked beef. The virginias have a real nice sweetness in this blend and smooths out the smoke from its burley which isn't harsh at all. I had flavors of salt and pepper with a real deep rich BBQ like essence to it. The earthiness was out of this world good and had the perfect balance.

The plug as moist as it felt required virtually no drying time, the only thing I could see is if I did let it dry a bit I wouldn't of had as much dottle. Seeing as the bottom third of the bowl for the life of me would not stay lit making me sad inside. I could not get enough of this smoke.

The initial lighting was very easy, a first for me. I usually struggle with getting flakes and plugs started and staying however this one I had smooth sailing besides a relight midway through due to some conversations with the neighbors. The flavors were very warm and comforting with a lot of depth in the charred sweetness, the methods they used to fire cure the leaves are quite magical.

The pipe I used was my small Dr. Grabow bulldog, perfect for clenching so I can stuff my arms into my jacket and keep warm while doing the breathing technique to solidify my cadence which just does wonders on this blend. Enjoying the scenery of what was green turning brown yellow and orange but fearing the harsh winter about to swallow it all up in the back of your mind haha.

All around first impressions this was fantastic, truly something special and I will be ordering some when the time comes. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes stout and meaty smoke and flavors. Be careful though, people say it has a nic kick I however didn't notice all too much.. It perked me up since it was the first thing I did in the morning but I didn't feel queasy.

Ciceronian: Where's the best place to order this? Is it a GQ purchase/risk tangling with customs for stateside folks?

carnesy: [Mars Cigars](http://www.marscigars.com/gh-darkplug.aspx) has it in 2 ounce, 8 ounce, and 500 gram blocks. Ships from PA, seems they're the only place stateside that has access to it.

====================================
C-Ray6: I recieved some Dark Plug from /u/slamfrankel. Easily one of, if not my favorite pipe tobaccos.

====================================
bonehed: Glad you enjoyed! I just had some mixed with Elizabethan... worked well together...
--
BWeice: You really knocked it out of the park with that package!

====================================
carnesy: I've got my prep method down to slicing wedges off with a cheap pair of guillotine cigar clippers, leave it dry a bit and break up the wedges. Gravity fill, light tamp, repeat. Lights up well, burns well, tastes amazing.
--
BWeice: That's about the same as I did minus the cigar cutter and drying, I cube cut with my swiss army blade and then broke it up a bit with my fingers and then gravity fed the bowl. I'll try drying it to see if I get less dottle.
--
carnesy: Went with the clippers because all my knive currently have shitty edges on them. Need to sharpen them but don't have time while classes are in session. In the mean time I figure if the cheap plastic and metal clippers break I'm out $4 so they'll do for now.

Tamp because of the odd shaped wedge bits. If I could get a uniform cut 1 gravity fill would likely be enough.
--
BWeice: this is going to sound silly, but if you got a toilet with a tank pop it off next time you have 'business' to take care of and sharpen it on the raw ceramic underneath... or a coffee cup haha.

Sounds good I'll give it a go.
--
carnesy: Believe me with 2 brothers who are former army (one an infantryman), and general outdoors types, I know about the toilet top/coffee cup trick.

pixeechick: Mind if I flair this as a review?

BWeice: Certainly, I always mean to use the template but I find myself rambling.
--
pixeechick: Done.
