Sutliff Frosty Mint, spur of the moment review

I wanted something christmassy. And for some reason mint came to mind. Something like a candy cane! *research research research* Turns out sutliff's frosty mint is one of the most extreme mints out there.  Hell. Yeah.  ordered an ounce from P&C. Trying out the twist pack method in my all black customized cob. 4 puffs in and I'm done. What kind of putrid blend is this? A mix of ashy charcoal briquettes and listerine pulverize my taste buds. A smoke so hot it makes the sun look like a snowball. And I'm left with an after taste of sadness and disappointment.  I've never tried a tobacco and been so disgusted.  Overall 0/5

chewsyourownadv: If you're not drying your tobacco... dry your tobacco. Especially Sutliff's aromatics.

annoyingbeggar: Literally all I get from Frosty Mint is mint. Nothing else. Honestly strange to me that you're getting anything else, including nothing.

Want to take a wild guess what he did wrong?..

TheAnimePiper: Too minty by itself, I mix it with Sutliff Chocolate Mousse.

levins0: How long have you been smoking pipes?

Sutliff aromatics are extremely gooey and need to dry out.  If you smoke them too fast, they burn very hot.

Also, be aware that anything you smoke Frosty Mint in will forever taste like Frosty Mint.

I have a cob dedicated to this stuff, because every once in a while I like it.  I've mixed a pinch in with Blood Red Moon to kick it up a notch, and that works well.  By itself it's like smoking a York Peppermint Patty.

NapalmBBQ: My local pipe club president says Sutliff uses "garbage tobacco".

None: I dunno, on a hot summer day it's kinda nice actually.  I bought Frosty Mint to taste extreme mint in a pipe tobacco, and lo and behold that's what it delivered.  Met my expectations.
