---
So the results are in for voting on the next round of reviews. We have:

* August: Rattays - Old Gowrie  (picked in the previous voting)
 
* September: Solani, Aged Burley Flake (Blend 656) With 13 votes
 
* October: GL Pease Sixpence with 11 votes

* November: Cornell & Diehl Bayou Morning with 9 votes


So get your orders in and lets have some fun!!

Now lets talk POTY for 2016. This round we feel the community should have a bit more say in what maker/price point we go with.    
For a quick refresh 2013 was Savinelli in a few different shapes, 2014 was a JnJ Rhodesian and 2015 was a beautiful egg by DSH)
What will 2016 be? Let us know what you would like to see. We have collaborated on a survey to gauge what yall would like to see. From price to shape to how its made, weve tried to cover it all. So if you would please take this survey and we will go from there.

We are looking forward to hearing your responses!!



====================================
Cycleoflife: Excited about the upcoming tobacco reviews. Great choices, everyone! Two blends I've been wanting to try and one that I should have been wanting to try.
--
scriptonic: The last spot was a close one. Bayou morning had 9 votes and orlik dark strong had 8. not gonna lie I was hoping dark strong was going to be in the top three. would have given me an excuse to order some hahah
--
PipeBeard: I've really been enjoying my first tin of DSK.  The black licorice tin note alone is fantastic.
--
====================================
dashn64: Done the survey :)

Ages ago there was talk of a meer POTY (I think /u/uselessJD brought it up). Has that thought gone down the drain or is there room for discussion?
--
uselessjd: Yes, I was in talk with some meer carvers.  You can disregard anything I have said, though, as I am not part of the PotY stuff nor will I ever be a part of it again for this subreddit.
--
dashn64: Oh okay, sorry for bringing you into it mate.

--
uselessjd: No problem it just isn't something that I have my finger in any longer. 
--
scriptonic: Thank you for doing the survey, as far as a custom meerschaum that is something I'm going to have to research and find out all of the ins and outs of. Custom meerschaum carvers are rare in comparison to brair carvers, and even rarer this side of the world. I'm not saying it can't be done, I just saying I need more info.
--
dashn64: I completely agree mate. Only bringing it up since it was mentioned before. At the end of the day I couldn't care less if the POTY is briar, meerschaum or morta wood.
--
====================================
PipeBeard: Oh no, now I have to order some more Solani ABF. Whatever shall I do ;)


--
scriptonic: So should I put you down for a four star review now or just wait for the review? hahaa?
--
PipeBeard: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
--
====================================
C-Ray6: Mmmm Sixpence.
--
====================================
mile_high_me: What do you mean I can't have an artisan for 50.00 bucks?? And who the hell are you callin' sugar?? Thanks for the ability to add input sweetie!
--
scriptonic: Np sug ;)
--
====================================
None: I didn't see a cob option for the POTY, what are you some kind of pipe snob?
--
scriptonic: Short answer? Yes.   
Long answer? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.

--
scriptonic: missing bayou morning?

--
crimsonrat: Yup
--
scriptonic: k i got some in the cellar i'll shoot off to you if you want to do the review. I dig it a lot, especially at the price point its at. but you know me I'm a frugal jerk haha. let me know and I'll get some in the post to you

====================================
levins0: Some feedback about the survey:

First, I'd like to see multiple options allowed.  I mean, there are a bunch of pipe shapes that interest me, and some that don't, so I think it'd be better to be able to select multiples.

Also, regarding the prices and types of pipes, I think they need to be matched up.  In other words, if it's a high grade artisan pipe or a smooth pipe, I could see paying more for it, while I wouldn't want to pay $200+ for a relatively new artisan doing partially machine made rusticated pipes.

Anyway, I answered with my top preferences, so hopefully that'll help with some guidance about what to go with for next year.

scriptonic: > First, I'd like to see multiple options allowed. I mean, there are a bunch of pipe shapes that interest me, and some that don't, so I think it'd be better to be able to select multiples.

This is why in that question there is a text box where users can write in their answers.

This why the last "question" was put in place. This survey is just a *guide* to gauge where peoples interests are at. General shape, price point, etc. Obviously a $50 high grade artisan is not going to happen, nor is a $400 rusticated machine made billiard. 
--
levins0: Thanks for the reply.  I guess I figured it'd be easier to check off multiple shapes rather than a freeform text box where I just relist the shapes that are already listed that I'm interested in, but whatever works for you guys is fine by me.

For the second point, I was sort of thinking that there should be some way for me to say "I'm willing to spend up to $100 if it's a factory pipe, but up to $200 if it's artisan.  I don't want to spend more than $200 though".  Or something like that.

But hey, if this gives you a good idea of what to organize, then that's all that counts.

Thanks again!  I'm looking forward to the result.

====================================
Mordenkrad: If we end up with a savinelli or some factory thing we've done ourselves a great disservice. We have buying power, and that gives us the opportunity to get a good deal on a great pipe. the J&J pipe is a prime example of what we CAN have. 

So, aim high motherfuckers. Have some taste.
--
scriptonic: It is not a great disservice not picking a high grade artisan maker every year for the poty. The simple fact of the matter is not everyone here can/will drop 300 bones on a pipe. This is why I added the price range question, and currently only 5 people have selected any of the ranges from 200 and up, while 21 people have picked the 100-150 mark.

As for the hand made/factory/artisan question the 2 pipes out of the same shop is a clear leader right now.
--
ajpl: I'm with you on this one. If I wanted to buy a factory-made Sav, I could just hop on smokingpipes.com and go to town. A PoTY is a fantastic opportunity to leverage a little bit of economics of scale and get something really nice at a significant discount—the fact that this year's PoTY is in the $250-350 range is just insanely discounted, imo.
--
tennesseean_87: I agree about not getting factory pipes for that reason. 
--
====================================
C-Ray6: Anyone know of any reputable online seller's (US) to snag the Old Gowrie from? P&C and smokingpipes are out, I seen a couple in google but they weren't places I recognized.
--
PipeBeard: i love this stuff, so it's a bummer that it's backordered at a bunch of online retailers.  At least for now, it appears to be in stock at 4noggins, who is reputable.
--
C-Ray6: Thank you! Definitely ordering some. 
--
====================================
PipeBeard: I know that Savinelli was an option through the good folks at Laudisi.  Do we have any like connections to Peterson? It would be cool to have the choice of a fishtail or p-lip.
--
carnesy: I'd love a higher end Pete p-lip with a military mount. Preferably a bent shape and possibly in an XL size.

I'd be fine with a "factory" pipe if the shape/size/bit/finish was unique to us. Like the XL 28 in a military mount with a squared off stem ending in a P-lip.

Or a high end /artisan churchwarden would be cool.

***PLEASE NOTE I AM DRUNK AT TIME OF POSTING! PLEASE REFRAIN FROM TRASHING ME ON ALL THE REASONS A DIAMOND SHANK/STEM MILITARY MOUNT WOULD LOOOK STUPID!***


***ON SECOND THOUGHT GO AHEAD. DRUNK ME IS CURIOUS AND SOBER ME CAN USE A LESSON ON WHY HE SHOULDN'T LET DRUNK ME REDDIT!***
--
crimsonrat: They don't: http://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/estate/england/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=17030

But p-lips suck.
--
carnesy: Why do P-lips suck? I've never had one so I'm curious as to their down sides over traditional fishtail stems.
--
crimsonrat: A lot of people love them, but I just don't understand the point. I bought one, smoked it once, then sold it. Just feels weird. I don't really "clench", so it didn't work as intended for me.
--
carnesy: Huh, I do clench a lot and P-lips look really uncomfortable to clench. I kind of want to break my clenching habit and thought a P-lip would help... I just don't see how people can clench them. I clench fishtails by seating the button back between my molars when I want it really secure and if I just need my hands free for a moment then I balance the button between my front teeth and use the weight of the pipe "wedge" keep it in position.
--
crimsonrat: Buy one as an estate and try it out. You can generally get your $ back. 
--
PipeBeard: The one that I have is very light, so it's easy and comfortable to clench (but I'm also used to clenching a Sav 320 - after that, anything easy, I guess).  I like it, and wil certainly pick up another one.  It essentially directs the smoke towards the roof of your mouth.  It was weird getting used to at first, but I've grown to really like it, especially with Burley blends.
--
carnesy: Yeah between my Sav 315 EX and my Peterson Kinsale XL 28, weight isn't really an issue for me anymore... it's just the lip shape seems odd for clenching is all.
--
====================================
soymilkisgood: Where's the option for a Jess Chonowitsch 2016 POTY? I demand answers!
--
Mordenkrad: No Nana Ivarsson 365 day set? Fuck this survey.  
--
soymilkisgood: 366 day set. I don't want to be without one on leap years. 
--
scriptonic: Seeing as he only makes what 100 pipes a year? I don't think he'll be on board with a poty lol
--
soymilkisgood: I'll sweet talk Tom Eltang into doing it. I know it will be a downgrade, but I'm willing to sacrifice for the greater good. 
--
scriptonic: See if Jess will do a collaboration piece with Tom for out poty.
--
tennesseean_87: No, Jess and Joe Case. 
--
====================================
tennesseean_87: Re: POTY, does anyone have experience with OldSchoolPipes (check his instagram)? I'm not sure he'd even do it since he doesn't do a lot of commissions, but a lot of the pictures look nice, the price is right for most, and it's not just a factory pipe. He does Rustic and Smooth finishes, and sometimes bamboo, all under $150, I think. 
--
soymilkisgood: I know the guy. Not going to happen. 
--
tennesseean_87: I wasn't sure it would. What do you think of his work (PM if you don't want to say publicly)?
--
carnesy: Please say publicly, I would love to here a more learned opion of a "artisan" makers works.
--
====================================
Pipezilla: For POTY what about a Jake Hackert or a David Jones?  Both makers turn out awesome pipes and most likely will be about 150-175?
--
soymilkisgood: I doubt they'll be open to doing POTYs. There are also somewhat limited in the shapes they do, so it's unlikely we'll go that route. Thanks for the suggestion, though!
