[Review]: McClelland TQ - Top Quality Gold & Toasted
By: Tobacconism
---
I've been on the lookout for some hard pipe hittin' aros, and one of you gentlemen/scholars pointed me in the direction of McClelland TQ blends.  Gold and Toasted arrived yesterday and it is pretty much exactly what I was looking for.
 
 
The tin note (it's bulk tobacco, but bear with me), like I was saying the tin note was amazing.  Not overly cloying like a lot of the tinned aros I've been picking up lately, not overly synthetic like some of the dime store pouches, but strong, distinct, buttery with toffee and rum overtones. It tastes fantastic, too.  Dark and broody on the bottom, butterscotch on the top.  It's more of a dessert than an all day smoker.  I recommend it, and if you're ever in the neighborhood, stop by and I'll share (if there's any left).

freepancakesforall: Amen. TQ has been one of my favorites for a while. It's the perfect end of the day dessert blend for me.
