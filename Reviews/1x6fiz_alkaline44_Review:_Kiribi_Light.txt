Review: Kiribi Lighter (Kabuto style)
By: alkaline44
---
Hi guys, I'm pretty new here (longtime lurker mostly) but wanted to start trying to get into this community a little more. I thought I'd start reviewing pipes and tobacco and accessories and stuff - I'm by no means an expert, only been into pipes for about a year now, but I'm infatuated with the hobby. 

My kit consists of a couple of cheap pipes (a secondhand Peterson and an old Comoy), a jar of Frog Morton, and - the nicest thing I own currently - the Kiribi pipe lighter I just bought [here from SmokingPipes.com](http://www.smokingpipes.com/accessories/lighters/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=141097). First I thought I'd review this bad boy since they are apparently brand new to the market.

I went with the 'Kabuto' style which means it has a wing on top to help you flick it open before lighting. I also got the short model (it's about 2-2.5 inches long) in 'black nickel' which seems to be a sort of gunmetal. It set me back $72.50 and I got free shipping for some reason from SmokingPipes - they're fucking awesome.

[Here are some pictures of the lighter.](http://imgur.com/a/bMLPk)

It feels very substantial in the hand and has some heft. All the parts seem to be fairly high quality metal, and the striker bar feels satisfactory upon use. The flames are dual-jet and come out at a 90ยบ angle, perfect for lighting your pipe. The wing on the top really does help - it kind of looks like a samurai helmet thing and it's very convenient to push down with your thumb to lift the cap. 

It seems like this thing holds a shit load of butane, I've had it for three days and used it constantly and haven't had to refill yet. My black matte Old Boy runs out every other day with my level of use. Also the flame adjuster on the bottom is easy to get a thumbnail into to turn and seems about right as far as sensitivity.

All in all I say this lighter is a very good deal for $72. I spent a little over $100 on my Old Boy a year ago and while I still love it I can see this little Kiribi working it's way to the forefront of my rotation due to it's convenient size and durability. Oh I forgot I've dropped this thing three times now on concrete and ... the thing's a tank apparently. Highly recommended for any other pipers on a modest budget out there!

Sincerely,

alkaline44

Deckma: Does the fill valve at the bottom have a cap or cover like the old boy? 

How does the bottom of the lighter look like? 
--
alkaline44: No but it is recessed a centimeter or two under the plate, doesn't seem like it'll ever catch anything in there.

Jasfss: **edit: I'm a big dumb person who didn't check out different aerosol straws before shutting down. My model is fantastic, just finished a nice session of some squadron leader. Thanks /u/TurnerJ5 for your help and support!**


OK this is perfect timing. I ordered one as well and received it yesterday. I'm mainly a matches guy, but this lighter looked beautiful so I wanted one.

I cannot get it to light, whatsoever. I pressed the straw of a can of Ronson butane into the valve, and it seems like most of it shot out the sides (the lighter got cold though, so dunno). Can't get it to light at all, just sparks. Customer support couldn't help me, so I'm afraid I got a defective one. Anyone know what dumb thing I'm doing before I send it back to be checked?

TurnerJ5: ###edit: just in case he doesn't update his comment, Jasfss messaged me that there was a technical difficulty and he was able to successfully fill the lighter and it is working fine now. :D

Which customer support did you contact? SmokingPipes.com?

Sounds like you're having some trouble filling them...I haven't had any issue with the Savinelli/IM Corona brand butane I've been using, but it could be a nozzle issue. Have you shown it to any guys at a pipe shop for their input? Though I'll give you benefit of the doubt in that it probably isn't just a 'technique' issue.

PM me your email address and I'll get you a calltag to return it to us and will send you a new one right away with a tin of tobacco.

BearGraves: I have the Mikasuki Standard (Crescent Moon), and I'm right there with ya. While a 'feather weight' is a great for (say) a cell phone, I want a feeling of something substantial in my lighter, and if quality can be detected in materials and weight, I get the feeling that I now own a lifetime lighter (unless I lose it). FWIW, I smoke a ton, and I am now on 23 days w/o a refill.
