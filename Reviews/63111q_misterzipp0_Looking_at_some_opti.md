Looking at some options on round 2 of the mystery review

Posted a thread on r/mysterytobaccoreview but I thought I'd ask here to get some feedback as well.

Last time we reviewed two C&D blend tobaccos and the response was ok but there wasn't as much participation as I hoped with the amount of people that played.

If I went with a different blender and *told you what the brand was ahead of time* would that be an incentive for anyone else?

If I go with someone else the $/oz will be more so I may not get to do a big prize but from the feedback I got the first time that's not a huge issue with most folk, the prize was a nice bonus.

Would you want to see more tobacco in your sample?

A smaller prize? (8 deco tamper or such)

Don't care about the prize?

Thoughts?

Still trying to see if I can make this work as I'm 90% sure I'm moving in June but you never know.

SupraMario: Prize didn't make me play, the fun of it did. Any blends work for me

PeskyPrussian: C&D is a good brand for it because telling people its C&D doesn't really narrow things down since they have several hundred blends, lol. Unfortunately, not everybody is a fan of C&D in general. I thought the sample amount was good and I really didn't care about the prize at all. It was just fun to try new things. Looking forward to round 2.

I'm also moving across the country in June, but would be willing to take a turn organizing the mystery reviews in the future.

freepancakesforall: 
Prize: bragging rights (maybe flair) and a FREE buy-in to the next round of mystery reviews.    

Tobaccos: I liked the first format. Two random bags. I don't want to know the blender. That's half the fun!

misterzipp0: Hmm... I like that!

feernot: This. ^

====================================
02BabyMoose: (I came here too late to participate) but I wanted to join in just for the fun of it. Not because it was a specific blend or band or anything else like that. I look forward to round 2, count me in!

givemeyours0ul: I liked everything about it, knowing the blender works only if it's a big one (C&D, H/H, Mac Baren etc.). Honestly I liked it alot, sample size was good, I even had a bunch of tasting notes but I somehow didn't manage to write a review. Things are less hectic at work, I'll do better next time.

====================================
Dadgy: I'd really prefer not to know the blender beforehand, because of the unnessecary bias it may interject.Blend #2, Super Balkan, was the first C&D blend I've tried that I really liked, and I may have shaded off a bit if I was sure it was C&D beforehand.

wayward_midland: Still interested in round 2, knowing the blender might be useful and a larger sample is appealing. The prize isn't really important, I'm looking at this as more of an incentive to try to pick apart a blend and test my palate rather than guessing the exact blend. Without having smoked a large variety, my guesses would be limited, but I read some very interesting comments from other users on how they went about the tasting process which sounds fun.
