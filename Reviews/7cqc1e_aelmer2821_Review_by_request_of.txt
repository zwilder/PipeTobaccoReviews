Review by request of the people!

Good afternoon brethren. My last post was an attempt to get some insight to the desires of the People, and they have Spoken! Today, travelers, we shall delve into the mystique that is.....[Stonehenge!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXzzHM8zLw).

But seriously, let's get a bit of a history lesson shall we? First off, there is a common thought betwixt 2 camps on the "Lakeland Essence;" Love and adoration or pure, unadulterated hatred. I wanted to know where this came from, so I did some digging. What I found was that there was a type of Royal Edict way back when. Actually, it was around the early 1800's. There were I guess a number of reasons for why, suspicion ranged from watered down booze causing mold to tobacco being pressed with fillers like sawdust. So in the early 1800s, the King passed into law in England a tobacco Purity act, which required the leaves to be of a certain quality, with no fillers, and a casing consisting of (reportedly) "Only the finest, naturally occuring flavours, with no artificial or confectionery flavour or seasoning." IN some places that was Rum, or Whiskey, or Licorice, but within the Lake Lands ( Kendal), that was Germanium, anise essence, and some suspect Rose Hips. 

See, these were all popular flavors for candies at the time, and being popular at the time, were a natural go to for the companies producing tobacco there. Move it forward a century, and tastes change, and popularity dwindled, but 2 producers still utilized it. 

So what the hell does this have to do with a review? Much less, what the hell does this have to do with /u/antiwittgenstein? Well, as stated before, this review is for Stonehenge, or rather, Stonehenge Flake. 

So out of the Tin (which G.L. Pease has some of the best Tin Art) its your standard Dark flake, Virginas with Perique and Burley. It's bouquet however, is somewhere akin to a rose garden or Possibly the Perfume counter at Macy's. Like the real Macy's. On 5th  Avenue. Sweet, musky, with a hint of Rose. This stuff is DAMP out of the tin. I mean all flakes are kind of moist, but this is like near dripping. I had to let it dry about 45 minutes before smoking. 

Once it dries a bit, its easy to rub out. "But Elmer, I thought you did the Fold and Stuff method!!?" I do, typically, but these flakes are on the Thick  and long side. So its easier to rub out. On the char, you get the full essence: Rose, with Anise is what I taste. But others may taste something else, like soap. Its all a matter of flavor and palate I guess. 

The essence fades through the bowl, although different flavors do tend to show: pepper from the perique, sweet from the VA, and chocolate from the burley. But strength wise, I would call it medium in flavor, and low on Nicotine (by comparison to my other blends). 

Ultimately, I would say that this is a solid 3 out of 5. Its damp, requires a bit of prep, but has good flavor profile, and its not overwhelming on the "Essence." I do find its a good after dinner smoke, and pairs well with a Vanilla porter, for what it's worth. 

So there you have it /u/antiwittgenstein, the people have spoken, the review has been made, the die cast. Until next time, Hello Cleveland!
====================================
antiwittgenstein: While I don't approve of Lakelands I do approve of your commitment to the contest. Another fun review nonetheless. Lakeland is what I expect Life Boy soap to taste like.
