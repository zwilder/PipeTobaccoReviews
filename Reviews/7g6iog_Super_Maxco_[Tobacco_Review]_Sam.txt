[Tobacco Review] Samuel Gawith’s Chocolate Flake
By: Super_Maxco
---
**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith’s Chocolate Flake

**Description on Tin:** What appears to be a bunch of expletives in danish.

**Leaf:** Thick, super moist dark flakes

**Tin Aroma:** A dark smell of tobacco topped with a distinct dark 70% chocolate.

**Taste:** The dark chocolate is definitely there in the back but as I've experienced with burley blends, the flavor jumps around and develops during smoking. I caught a whiff of cigar-like taste more than once and also some soapiness at one point. There was a lingering taste of something medicinal, which I can't really pinpoint. Got a taste of latakia only once so I take it's mellowed into the flake. Overall a very satisfying full bodied smoke which left me longing for some chocolate pudding.


**Smokability:** Challenging. Tried drying and folding which led to many relights. Breaking the flake apart and drying which led to dry twigs that were still soaking wet in the middle. Finally rubbed the flake by rolling it between palms and dried it for 40 mins and got a perfect consistent ribbon cut which took light suitably.

**Thoughts:** After smoking MacBaren's Vanilla Loose for quite a while and after nailing the preparation, I've enjoyed this multidimensional full bodied tobacco as a dessert smoke.

**Summary:** A full bodied burley/virginia/latakia with a distinct dark chocolate flavor

====================================
AlfredDunhill: You've had more luck with this blend than I ever did. I could not detect any hint of chocolate, even after trying various methods of packing.

antiwittgenstein: SG Flakes are usually an adventure in preparation. Might have to try this one out - I am allergic to chocolate but I can still smoke it I think.

hicetnunc37: you'll be fine, its more of cacao flavor and it plays nicely with latakia. I would not consider this an aro. Its not bad at all.

====================================
kingjames488: nice.
been interested in trying a chocolate flake, either SG or GH bobs chocolate flake. If anyone's had both I'd  love to hear which you prefer.

also, if you're finding your tobacco is kinda dry but still wet in the middle or in spots put it in a bag or just bunch it up in a paper towel or something and leave it for a while for the moisture to equalize.
