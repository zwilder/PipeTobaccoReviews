The new Three Nuns: a review
By: MetalEd
---
So I'm super excited. . I got my first tin of the new Three Nuns today!  I've waited what feels like forever to try it.  I thought I'd do a review for you guys, to share the tasting notes. 

I gave the lid my customary twist to make sure it is tightly sealed before aging.The lid came right off with no effort, accompanied by an awful odor.

Instead of the review you came here for, here's this:

Blaaaaaarghhlglgllhlg.  The stench is unbelievable. 

I closely inspected the lid and there are no marks to indicate that it was ever pried open, so I surmise it was never sealed properly at the factory.Â 

Getting in touch with my retailer to see if they'll replace it or if I need to send it back to macbarens.

Now I'm just hoping the mold spores that inevitably flew out aren't all over my house or in my son.

Edit:
Within 1 hour of emailing them, the retailer has a replacement in the mail for me.  They have the best customer service ever!   I'd name them but that might come off more as 'X sent me defective product'
====================================
cgrd: :-( Boourns. I sure hope you receive satisfaction from the retailer or MacBarens.

Edit: Perhaps this photo can now be used for educational purposes for those "Bloom vs Mold" threads.

MetalEd: Having seen a non moldy tin, I was wrong.  The black is perique- which looks to be quite mold resistant! 

Only the white fur is mold.

cgrd: Neat. Perhaps the fermentation that the perique undergoes adds to its resistance.
--
MetalEd: Apparently it's Kentucky dark fired, not perique. 
It fooled me into thinking it was perique because it tastes fermented. .. so the fermentation theory stands. 
--
MetalEd: The black is a dead giveaway for mold :)

====================================
CanuckFrogmorton: *shudders* never want to experience this...hate mold and this would be so disappointing.

====================================
mimefrog: Wow.  That happened to mine as well, but a few weeks after I jarred it, so I figured it was my bad.  Boo.
--
MetalEd: Wait a sec. .. this happened to your tin of Three Nuns specifically?

Me thinks something smells. .. er.. moldy. . down at the MacBaren factory. 
--
mimefrog: Yes 3 Nuns.

:(
--
MetalEd: Seems like that is an unlikely coincidence. 
--
====================================
sirmisterchris: Oh god, has this happened to many people before?
--
MetalEd: I'd like to know too. .
--
====================================
MasterBettyFTW: oh the horror!

====================================
ice_09: What a shame! I can almost smell that tobacco through that photo. I hope your retailer treats you right and we can get that review.
--
====================================
briarleaf000: Compromised tin, moldy, your retailer should send you a new tin immediately. I had a similar issue once with a tin from SPC and they made good in 2 days.
edit: saw your edit now. glad it all worked out.
--
====================================
pwny_: OP, are you alive? Did the mold spores kill you?
--
MetalEd: OP here. .
Hour 6 since exposure.  Things are happening.  The infection has changed me.  I have an unquenchable thirst for The Glenlivet, and am grinding my teeth thinking about a bowl of virginia flake.  My body has entered some kind of pupal stage within my smoking couch in the garage.  I... want to infect other people.  This parasite has begun to control my mind.  I can only hope that help comes quickly, like my pipe club, armed to the teeth with Full Virginia Flake. .
--
pwny_: WHERE ARE YOU? I'M GETTING IN THE CAR NOW
--
====================================
RoydnJr: Damn. I bought a few tins to cellar and try out at a later date. Maybe I should pop one open...
--
MetalEd: No need to crack them. . Just give the lids a twist by hand to make sure they were sealed
--
====================================
noreallyimgoodthanks: Wow look at all that bloom...
  
Anyway, sorry to hear about the tin. I was looking forward to a review. Now for a weird question - there is an awesome youtube channel called MetalEd. Is that you?
--
MetalEd: Tis not.
--
noreallyimgoodthanks: Dang. Well it's awesome. Check it out. Assuming you like metal.

lwhjp: That's - uh - worrying. I bought some as well this month and jarred it. Mine doesn't look quite as furry as yours and there's no bad smell - and I can't remember if it looked like that when I got it out of the tin. Guess I'll quarantine the jar and see if it progresses.

This thread certainly suggests that there might have been a bad batch at the factory, though.

EDIT: peering closely at it, the white stuff looks more like crystals than mold. So I won't ditch the jar just yet.
--
MetalEd: If yours was bad. .. you'd know for certain. 
Was the tin tightly sealed?  If so you're good. 
--
lwhjp: Ah ok, that's reassuring then. I'm pretty sure the tin was sealed. Either that or I really like the smell of mold :)
--
====================================
None: Wow, that's nasty.
