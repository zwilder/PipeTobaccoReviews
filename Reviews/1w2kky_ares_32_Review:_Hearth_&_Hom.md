Review: Hearth & Home Fusilier's Ration

I recently joined the P&C Tobacco of the Month Club and received the first shipment yesterday. Since I haven't seen anyone else on here that decided to partake, I will take it upon myself to review each tobacco included each month. This month you can expect Stanwell Malange, Troost Aromatic Cavendish, and P&C blend of the month, Snow Drift. Hope you all enjoy them! Now onto the review!

**PICS:**http://imgur.com/a/9h0Cl

**Blend:** Hearth & Home Fusilier's Ration

**Description on Tin:** A rich and fragrant Latakia-based crumble cake using Cyprian Latakia, aged Virginias, select Orientals and a touch of unflavored Black Cavendish with a hint of an old fashioned top dressing. Let it transport you to a different time and place.

**Leaf:** Lots of Latakia with small traces of Virginia and Black Cavendish

**Tin Aroma:**  Small traces of ketchup with a very strong pepper sent.

**Taste:** The first 1/3 of the bowl was extremely mellow, which surprised me. I was expecting a stronger smoke based on the smell in the tin. Left my tongue feeling a little waxy. Has the strong pepper and spice flavor, typical of Latakia with hints of ketchup. Became a lot smokier near the end of the bowl, but not so much that it was not enjoyable.

**Smokability:** Smoked surprisingly well out of the small Dunhill that I smoked it in. Nice and cool if puffed slowly. Broken up, it takes a pack a lot more easily than some of the ready rubbed or ribbin cut Englishes that I have smoked. Smooth draw and relatively little smoke.

**Room Note:** To me, it was enjoyable, but I like the smell of a good English. Would probably not be the best around sensitive noses. Slightly stronger sent than EMP.

**Thoughts:** Being a tobacco that I've never even seen or considered, I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the nice smoky flavor and it was a good change from the 3 Nuns and EMP I have been smoking recently. The Virginia made me want to break out the tin of McClelland Christmas Cheer that I'm aging, but alas, that's going to wait until next year.

**Recommended to:** Anybody looking to switch from cigarettes to a pipe, or wanting a nice straight Virginia from an iconic producer.

**Summary:** Anyone looking for a medium to full bodied English. Definitely not a Lat-bomb, but has enough to make it the dominant tobacco in this blend.

**NEXT UP** Stanwell Malange

TheLatinGerman: Great review! I was thinking about joining that club as well. Would you say it's worth the money? Are the tobaccos you get worth the price?

ares_32: If the first shipment is any indication, it's going to be pretty fair for 20$ a month. I was happy this month. We'll see how the coming months go!
--
TheLatinGerman: Awesome thanks for the reply! I think I'll go ahead and give it a shot.

jarvis400: Many thanks for the fine review! Great to see photos of the tobacco.

I've grown weary of "lat bombs" and  this sounds something I might try.

ice_09: Great review! I am going to be keeping my eye on the tobaccos coming out of the P&C tobacco of the month club; if it keeps sending out tobaccos like these I will probably give it a go.
--
ares_32: I was surprised, to be honest. For 20$ a month, it's a pretty decent deal. Might help calm my TAD if I know I'm getting a surprise every month. Thanks!

facestab: Thanks for this review. I have been considering this blend for some time. Given the tin description I was expecting some unique taste. What else could they mean by old fashion topping!?

Also I'm impressed that this blend came on the tobacco of the month club.
