Tobacco Review: LJ Peretti Tashkent
By: PipeBeard
---
Blend name: Tashkent by LJ Peretti

Description on tin: Named for "The most beautiful city in Central Asia", this spicy, full flavored blend is made from Izmir Turkish and Latakia. Smooth with nary a strand of Virginia, Tashkent is a Turkish blend married with Latakia to produce a smooth, rich flavor with a hint of spiciness.

Leaf: Turkish and Latakia. [Pic](http://imgur.com/3y0K8yJ). It looks to be nearly equal parts. The cut is chunky, and some pieces look like broken ribbons while others look like broken flake. The moisture is perfect. Packs easily in wide bowls with a gravity fill and a slight thumb tamp. (Like a lot of similar blends, I find that Tashkent shines most in wider bowls, but it's also killer in a cob).

Tim aroma: Mostly smoky from the lat, a touch natural tobacco scent from the Izmir Turkish (which in addition to the natural brown and nutty tobaccoey goodness, smells a touch sweet, a touch sour, and a touch peppery). If you like the smell of Oriental blends, this does not disappoint. Lots of great lat campfire on the initial nose, but not overpowering, and then some added depth from the Turkish. You know what this one is all about right from the tin.

Taste: Oriental all the way, baby. There are obvious comparisons to make, here, to the legendary Sobrani and it's clones/homage blends (blue mountain, blackhouse, white knight, etc.), so let's get those out of the way first. 

Is Tashkent like Sobrani? Kinda. The lat and the turkish are every bit as luxurious. Without the VA, it's not a true comparison, but it is a big oriental in its own right. (Read on, I don't think the lack of VA hurts this one at all, actually, to the contrary...) Does Tashkent stand up? Yes. Big time. I'll go so far as to say that with Tashkent in my cellar, I don't actively hunt Sobranie anymore.

On the initial light, the taste is smoky like lat, but is followed immediately but a bright and not too spicy pepper. The mouthfeel is creamy like Penzance is creamy (not comparing flavors, this one is definitely spicier, but the creaminess is comparable). The spice level is very well balanced throughout, and never too much. The woodiness, mustiness, and camp-fieryness are all held in the perfect balance.  There is a depth and body here that I almost didn't initially expect without the VA. Somehow, it's sweet enough without. The Turkish really stands apart from the lat on the retrohale. 

Into the first half of the bowl, something floral really opens up from the turkish, and the edge of the spice is softened a bit. Not too much sweetness here, but more than, say, Blackhouse, and not as much sour as some of Peretti's Burley blends (very very little, actually). The body and spice come out a bit more in the second half.

Smooth, smooth, smooth, and creamy, and just the right spice.

Smokeability: Easy peasy. This could easily be a one match light, but I use two for safe measure, and it burns right down to white ash. This one has yet to bite me. This *could* be an all day smoke for some, but it's one that I prefer to sit and enjoy without accompaniment. Nic level is medium (I can smoke a full nording freehand and be ok to vape afterwards).

Roomnote: Smoky, woody, rich, leathery. Or as my three year old says "Ew, daddy!" To me, it's very pleasant, and is well regarded at the sportsman's club.

Mustache note: musty, smoky, manly

Thoughts: This is, perhaps, as good an oriental as I've had. It's certainly my go to, and is in my top 5. This checks off so many things on the "just right" list. If you are looking for a perfect fall blend, here it is.

Recommend to: Those who enjoy really high quality Englishes and Balkans. 

Summary: This one lives somewhere between Penzance and Balkan Sobranie, and I think it deserves every bit as much attention as those two.

Rating: 4.5 stars

My Background: Been a pipe smoker for a dozen years now. I smoke at least a pipe a day, sometimes three. Like my flair says, I'm a Sam Gawith fanboy, and predominantly favor VA, VA/Per blends, but I don't discriminate too much (Englishes, Balkans, Burleys, and Lakelands are all in my regular rotation).

My top five: Best Brown, Firedance, Gaslight, Stonehaven, Tashkent

Scale:  
5 stars: A Holy Grail.  
4 stars: Does it come in pounds?  
3 stars: Does it come in half pounds?  
2 stars: Two tins: one for now, one to age.  
1 star: I mean, I'll smoke the tin...  
0 stars: Anybody want the rest of this?  
-1 star: Trade with my enemies.  
-2 stars: Wouldn't wish on my enemies.  
-3 stars: "Flush these pipes turds!"

Eighchops: Good review! I will add it to the list.

pixeechick: Great review! Sounds like it would be right up my alley. 

On a side note, two spaces at the end of the line will function like the "enter" key without creating too big of a space (for your ratings).

PipeBeard: I definitely think this one is up your alley. 

Good call on the formatting. I'm on mobile (alien blue) and the spacing looked ok when I posted it, but I fixed it :)

====================================
facestab: Great review. I have been curious about L.J. Peretti blends.
--
PipeBeard: Their blends are great. I'm going to try to do a few more reviews of their blends, but this was the natural starting point. I can't imagine you'd be disappointed.
--
facestab: I'm at their site and I can't decide between Omega or Tashkent. :)

====================================
KaiserKraken: Perretti blends don't get nearly the attention they deserve. This is one of them. 

And it is PUNGENT. In a good way of course. My first order I smell through the packaging before I opened the mail box. An essential Oriental blend.

antiwittgenstein: Excellent review! It makes me want to finally blow some of my money on some LJP stuff.

====================================
Wulfsta: Just ordered four tins, since it sounds great.

====================================
Ciceronian: Great review on an absolutely fantastic blend. The quality of LJP blends (not to mention the sweet presentation in those yellow paint cans) almost counterbalances the number of horrific customer service stories I've heard from fellow pipers.
--
PipeBeard: Thanks! I love the stuff, if that wasnt obvious ;)

I've had great experiences in the shop, especially of late.  I know that there is one guy who can be tough, but I usually don't bother with him. Tom (who is on here) is fantastic, and was instrumental in making the Upvote blend happen.  

Also, I know that a while back they got a lot of complaints about shipping, but that has all changed.  I ordered a tin of Penzance yesterday after Tom posted it on Facebook. Granted, I live locally, but the package shipped within the hour and is waiting for me on my doorstep :)  I think the shipping fee was around $3.
