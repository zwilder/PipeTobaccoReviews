crimblade: **Blend Name:** Autumn Evening

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** Our proprietary red Virginia cavendish is lightly cased with a delicate maple flavor resulting in our best selling aromatic blend. The smoker will appreciate the taste of Virginias while those around will flock to the warm, inviting ...

**Leaf:** Cavendish, Virginia, course Cut

**Tin Aroma:** Syrup. Straight up maple syrup. The sheer power of it takes me back to when I was young and was given to the school of thought that pancakes were merely a vessel by which syrup could be transported to my mouth.

**Taste:** Primarily maple syrup, shocking I know. However lets remember that in the realm of aromatics having the blend taste as it smells is somewhat of an unexpected thing. Occasionally I get hints of whiskey, however when the syrup fades there's an ok tobacco taste in the background but nothing special

**Smokability:** Like most C&D offerings this one is great right out of the tin. The course cut makes it very easy to light up and keep lit with very little issues of the pipe going out or getting goopy in the end.

**Room Note:** Aunt Jemima. 

**Thoughts:** This is considered one of the aromatics to try when you're looking for an aromatic that actually delivers on giving you a flavor profile that matches the aroma. In that sense this blend hits it out of the park. However I find it to be very one dimensional when it comes to that flavor profile. All of the toppings are so well blended together that there's a consistency in the flavors they deliver, which is a good thing, but tends to bore me after 5 minutes into the smoke. Like all aromatics, well except firedance flake but that's a different review, the aromatic aspect isn't present throughout the smoke. In those spaces in between you're left with a bland sweetness of tobacco with nothing really interesting or flavorful without the aromatic topping.


**Recommend to:** Anyone who wants an aromatic to taste like it smells, most of the time.

**Summary:** This is one of those blends were I occasionally glance at it in it's jar and then will often pass it up for something better. It certainly is a decent smoke, but my problem with it is that there's so many better smokes out there. While I don't claim to go overly much for the aromatics when I do go for them I want something that I'll enjoy throughout the smoke and not just for 5 minutes. On the plus side it does have a decent Nicotine kick so at the very least you'll be feeling rather pleasant after the smoke. I think the most use I've gotten out of this blend is by doing a "meal" smoke with this as the dessert option.

**Drink Pairings:**  Coffee, because it tastes like maple syrup, it just really brings out that nice sweetness. Green Tea is also pretty spot on.

**Final Rating:** 2/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 3 years with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Morton's Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.

====================================
Zapotecorum: moisture - My bulk sample came at perfect smoking moisture- unlike most goopy aromatics, this one tastes fine if its dry.

Taste - tastes of maple syrup with only a tiny hint of actual tobacco in there. 

Room note - Extremely strong and cloyingly sweet scent of maple syrup. One of the worst smelling tobaccos that i smoke, simply because of the overwhelming strength of maple syrup smell - According to family

Nicotine - Like the moisture, this one is much different than most aromatics in that it has an actual nicotine kick, although nothing intense. I would rate it at Medium.

Overall - Its not bad, in my opinion. Definately not my favorite aromatic, But I'll slowly smoke the rest of my ounce, and probably never buy it again. I would rate it 2.5/4

TastesLikeBees: Apologies for the late submission. This is my first review, so please bear with me.
 
First, this was purchased in bulk from my local B&M, and smoked out of a MM Legend. I am relatively new to pipe smoking, and not a regular smoker of aros.
 
First Impression: The aroma is almost overpowering of butter and maple syrup. The color is a very uniform brown and an even, small ribbon cut. My bulk sample was relatively dry, and packed easily without drying.
 
The Smoke: This took a match very easily and, after an initial tamp, smoked incredibly easily. I let the charring light die down a bit, and the second match was the only other light required. The taste was a much milder version of the aroma, which was actually a bit of a treat, as I'm not accustomed to aromatics bearing any resemblance between smell and taste. As the bowl progressed, the more subtle notes of whisky, vanilla and, yes, tobacco, became more prevalent. 
  One pleasant surprise was just ow enjoyably easy this smoked. The ash was a fine grey dusting, no gurgle, no struggle to keep it lit, and no tongue bite at all. I really have to hand it to C&D, they've done a fantastic job of making a very heavy aromatic with none of the negative characteristics associated with it. 

I am unable to report on the room note, as it was smoked outside, but it seemed to match the overall olfactory senses that I would expect, and probably would be far from offensive to even the sensitive spouse. The nic hit was a tad higher than I would have anticipated, but just right for a blend meant for an "Autumn Evening". 

I give it a 2.5/4 for being a good smoke that's not really in my wheelhouse, and a 3/4 for folks who enjoy aromatics.
