Title: Cambridge Flake

Blender: L J Peretti, Boston, MA

Description: Here is a combination of two great English traditions. A mixture of Latakia, Turkish and mature Virginia pressed into a flake to provide a unique smoking experience. If you're an English smoker looking to branch out into flakes, this one is for you.

My review: You can get this flake for about 5 bucks an oz, but I'd pay more for it. I'm an avid lover of Englishes, but rarely smoke flakes for a variety of reasons. One is the prep. Sit this out to dry just a bit before smoking and you'll be happy. 

This little flake has a delightful sour note that is just magnificent. It's got some oriental in it that can give it some spice that I really like, and it's one of the few tobaccos that smells how it tastes most of the time. Both fold and stuff and rub out are recommended for this blend. I taste little of the Virginia, but maybe that's where some of the sour comes in. 

Out of one flake, I normally get an hour to an hour and half of smoking bliss. It's slow burning and cool smoking. If you have trouble slowing down, this could be helpful. 

All in all, smoke around. Don't go so crazy over so many of the unicorn blends. This is my absolute favorite, and I get a couple ozs a month at 10 bucks or so. 

Happy smoking!

hvywldrnss: One of my top 2 favorite Englishes. I haven't come across anything remotely similar either. Love it.

AmethystCoffin: Thanks for posting this. The review was great and I second your general outlook. The thrill of the hunt/chase is a fun rush, but you gotta settle down once and a while and enjoy a relaxing smoke as well!

TheNateB: I was at L J Peretti's two weeks ago picking up some Esoterica blends they had in stock and I always make an effort to by a few ounces of their blends when I am there. I grabbed this flake for the first time, usually get one of their ribbon cut English blends.

It is now my goto and I will be filling a jar in the next week or two when I can get out to the shop again. 

It has become my sneak out of work and have a slow outdoor smoke blend. I never finish a flake in the half hourish breaks I can take but at the price, it doesn't matter. It is really really nice.
