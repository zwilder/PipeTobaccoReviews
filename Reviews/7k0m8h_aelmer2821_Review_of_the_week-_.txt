Review of the week- Vincent Manil Pure Semois

Greetings, salutations, and hello fellow pipers! This week I had the Distinct pleasure of sampling a tobacco that I never thought I would. Thanks to /u/lord_garrett, and his endless kindness, I had a few ounces of Vincent Manil! now as always lets start with a history lesson. 

Semois is a rare tobacco indeed. It only grows in one valley in Belgium, which is miraculous to say the least. The climate there is not one you would think to be hospitable to tobacco at all, in fact. Its basically a Burley, but has such a rich history that it really stands apart from what we would be used to here. It is highly regarded in Europe, but hasn't had much of a foothold here in the US. Now traditionally, it has no topping, just the rich alkaline soil, the fog, and natural drying. 

This is a Ribbon cut tobacco. Kind of. Really, its more of a separation of the leaf than anything else. Irregular cuts of brown leaf. Now, this was a little bit dry. Not like cigarette or RYO dry, but definitely not moist. It packs well, if a little loose for my taste. 

Char is a char. HOWEVER, I was a bit confused. You see, I was expecting Carter Hall, PA, not Maduro. That's right. On the char it tasted like a cigar. Needless to say I was caught off guard. For the first half after the light, it was the same. I was like, hold on, now my pipe is ghosted! shit!. It was like smoking a good cigar, but still a cigar.

Second half changes, it becomes more sweet, more herbal, and less like a cigar and more a pipe tobacco. 
It doesn't have much dottle, and smokes fairly clean. 
This is not a nicotine powerhouse. Far from it actually. 

So overall not abad smoke. I would keep it with a dedicated pipe though. It's cigar type body could ghost a pipe pretty easily I think. But for a good interesting smoke, that isn't gonna Vitamin N you to death, its not bad. 3.5/5. 
====================================
freepancakesforall: I think this is a very accurate, spot on review (for my tastes at least). Thanks for sharing! The only thing I have a slight squabble with is the opinion of strength and nicotine. While it's not Brown Bogie, it's not exactly a lightweight. I'd consider this a relatively strong burley that can sneak up on you in a hurry if you smoke too fast, which is likely for first-timers due to the dryness of the leaf.

chewsyourownadv: I've always found it to be very stout in terms of flavor and mouthfeel.  Nicotine, not so much, but it always seemed to me like it *should* be a gutpunch of nicotine.
--
freepancakesforall: Fair point. I'm also not the strongest stomach on this sub. I'd say I start feeling the effects in the Stonehenge Flake range. Not nauseous, but definitely a light sweat and "whoah" feeling.

AuRelativity: > whoah

Not sure which it was, but last time I had the occasion to smoke a couple bowls in a row, I had to sit down for a couple of minutes to compose myself.
--
cmdr_andrew_dermott: Made me woosy, but I was going pretty steady at s bowl of Petite Robin. Definitely hit like a cigar smoked too fast. No bite though.
--
aelmer2821: Remember, My nicotine gauge is still skewed from 20+ years of cigarette smoking. So the caveat here would be "for me, it's not a nic powerhouse."

====================================
chewsyourownadv: LPT: Try mixing in about 25-50% Drama Reserve, or some other similar *very* Oriental forward blend, like Yenidje Supreme or Katerini Classic. You'll be amazed how well they play together.
--
mrubni: Seconded; I'm smoking my own mixture of semois, izmir & perique as I type this. Very good.
--
chewsyourownadv: While that does sound good (I've got a bit of pure blending of izmir and perique too, may have to try this), I'd put izmir in a different class from Drama, Katerini, or Yenidje. The latter three are quite a bit more floral and sweet, kinda delicate. Izmir, a bit more full bodied and flavorful. I bet Izmir does play well with Semois, but in a totally different way. 

Are you familiar with McClelland's Grand Orientals lineup?
--
mrubni: I am, I've been loving some Samsun recently.
--
tankbuster183: I have the Supreme and Katerini and have been looking forward to them, just trying not to open everything at once.
