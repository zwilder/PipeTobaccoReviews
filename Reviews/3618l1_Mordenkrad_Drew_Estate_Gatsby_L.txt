Drew Estate Gatsby Luxury Flake Review

So it's been awhile since I've last written a review. Figured it is time is to get back in the saddle, and what better choice than a free blend? 

**Blend Name:** Gatsby Luxury Flake

**Description on Tin:** Sophisticated, but what does that mean?! This smoke is pleasantly sweet and mild with just the right mix of Cavendish and Sweet Virginia tobaccos. Ah, People will think you are some sort of aficionado that is what Sophisticated means….

**Leaf:** Cavendished burley with brightleaf and brown Virginia for body.

**Tin Aroma:** Sweet and sort of rummy. Smells exactly like Mac Baren Navy Flake.

**Age:** N/A

**Pipe(s) Used:** 1930s Kaywoodie billiard (my topped VA flake pipe) and Meerschaum

**Taste:**. Very sweet with the sort of hay and grass notes you expect out of decent quality VA flake. I don’t get any nuttiness out of the burley or blah-ness out of the Cavendish, but I do get an absurd amount of sweetness. There’s a definite topping over the blend that reminds me of a fruity rummy sort of thing. Tastes like Mac Baren Navy Flake.

**Smokability:** Burns very hot. Requires a lot of attention to prevent tongue obliteration. Smokes well though and comes packed fairly dry, it only needed about half an hour of drying to smoke well… Just like Mac Baren Navy Flake

**Room Note:** Vaguely sweet and cloyingly grassy. Nothing extravagant, but what you’d expect from a navy flake… Like Mac Baren Navy Flake.

**Thoughts:** It reminds me a lot of Mac Baren Navy Flake.

**Recommend to:**  People who like Mac Baren Navy Flake.

**Summary:** Its Mac Baren Navy Flake. You can learn more about this blend here http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2vtc2o/review_mac_baren_navy_flake/ and here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQOrzKqpK8Y and here http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/706/mac-baren-navy-flake

MetalEd: I only smoke MacBaren Navy Flake but I'm not sure I'd like this based on his description.
