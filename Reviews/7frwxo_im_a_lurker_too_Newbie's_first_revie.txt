Newbie's first review: Peter Stokkebye "English Luxury"

/u/antiwittgenstein's contest has inspired me to proverbially "get off my ass" (as I type this from the comfort of my La-Z-Boy office chair) and start contributing to the community that has unknowingly guided the beginning of my journey into piping. So, here goes:

**About the reviewer:**
 
I'm a relatively new piper having just picked up the hobby in early August.  I've smoked cigars semi-steadily for over a decade, generally preferring medium to full-bodied sticks.  I'm a 1-3x/week smoker depending on the season.  I've experimented with roughly a dozen of this community's excellent suggestions and my go-to blend at the moment is Dunhill MM965.

**About the tobacco:**

English Luxury is described as 
>"A characteristic English Mixture, developed from mellow Georgian Virginias, black Cavendish, Mexican Burleys and Cyprian Latakia."

I doubt I could identify all the components myself.  All I know is my local tobacconist recommended this to me when I mentioned I was interested in trying an English blend.   In my limited experience, this seems to be a solid "starter" English with a slight twist (more on that later).  At ~$3/oz OTC, it's one of the most affordable blends I've smoked so far.  The tobacco for this review was purchased from bulk.  

**From the pouch:**

The scent comes to me as a subdued version of what I would identify as a "classic English" - A slightly earthy tobacco with a pronounced note of “campfire" or "mesquite” (the latakia, I believe).  In this blend, the latakia scent is slightly subdued.  The "twist" I mentioned earlier comes in the form of a secondary sweet note that calls to mind brown sugar and dark fruits.  

I found this tobacco to be slightly wet out of the package.  Setting some out on a paper towel for about an hour seems to take care of the excess moisture.  

Like almost all the tobaccos I've tried so far, it comes in a ribbon cut.

**The Smoke:**

This blend starts off like a lighter-than-average English. Perhaps, a bit too light for my own tastes.  I would characterize the first quarter of the bowl as "bland".  I pick up a slightly toasty generic tobacco smoke and not much else.  Once you get past the underwhelming first quarter, this blend really starts to shine.  

Coming into the middle of the smoke, the character of the blend really starts to show.  The "classic English" taste comes out and stays present for the rest of the smoke.  It manifests to my palette as toasty (evoking mental images of fresh-baked bread), a touch nutty, and now carrying the hallmark campfire note of the latakia.  English blends evoke thoughts of a savory "meat and potatoes" meal in my mind's eye:  Warm, hearty, filling, and comforting.  This blend  gives me that same impression but, slightly subdued.  As if to make up for the slight loss of body vs a "standard" English, the sweet "twist" makes itself known from the second third right to the end of the bowl in the form of a slight yet, distinct touch of molasses on the palette. 

I would describe the overall body as mild-medium and smoke production as a bit above-average, producing trails that fall a couple steps short of the "thick and creamy" smoke I'm used to seeing from quality cigars.  Tongue bite is virtually non-existent and I've found this to be one of the easiest blends to keep lit out of everything I've tried so far. 

According to my non-smoker wife, the room note is "meh" (accompanied by a shrug of the shoulders).  We'll call it: "Tolerable". 

I've smoked in this blend 5 times now in a MM corn cob, a "Capri" basket pipe, and a ‘17 POTY. 

Objectively, I'd say this blend deserves a 7/10 due to the underwhelming first quarter of the smoke but, it's a personal 8/10 for me due to its accessibility in both purchase price and ease of smoking.

**The TL;DR**

Body: Mild-medium

Taste: Classic English with a slightly subdued latakia and a touch of sweetness.

Smoke production: Above average

Room Note: Tolerable

My overall score: 8/10
====================================
Zenith251: Right on! I couldn't agree with your more. An additional component that I appreciate from it is the pressed Virginia flavors that are present, but balanced by the rest of the mixture. Like you say, it's hardly an English blend. It works well in my pipes that I use for flake virginia's without throwing a ton of Latakia into the works, like Mcclelland's 2020.

im_a_lurker_too: Good point.  If I'm primarily picking up Virgina in the beginning of the bowl, that could be why I find that part underwhelming.  My palette may still be desensitized from full-bodied cigars so, Virginias tend to come off as "bland" to me.

FullFrontalNoodly: If you're looking for something less light try their Proper English, and since you like 965 you might also want to try their Balkan Supreme.

im_a_lurker_too: Thanks for the suggestions!  I think I'd really enjoy a fuller-bodied version of this provided it keeps just that hint of sweetness.  I picked up some LJP 220 along with my Thanksgiving Day order hoping from something like that but, was a bit underwhelmed after the first smoke.  I'm going to give it a few more tries before I form a solid opinion though.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for coming out of the woodwork, though now your user name is a bit of a malaprop. This was my first English and I think also the first thing I reviewed. Nice write up, I hope you keep them coming. 
--
im_a_lurker_too: Thank you, sir! It was a fun exercise in writing and "tasting" (trying desperately to remove any implication of pretentiousness in the term).

Prior to finding this sub, I thought 90% of the pipe tobacco market was captain black and tinder box house blends. I definitely owe this community a few more halfway decent reviews.

givemeyours0ul: Congrats on choosing the one true English as your favorite.
