Germain Rich Dark Flake: Pre-Review
By: Fuzzy_Totemz

I was at J. Hollingsworth today in the UK (Birmingham area) and picked up 12 oz of bulk Germain RDF.  
    
Backstory (from a UK pipe site):   
**Germains Rich Dark Flake Pipe Tobacco:**  
*Rich Dark Flake was produced specifically for the UK market in response to high demand for the Stonehaven blend that is produced solely for the US as part of the Esoterica range. Esoterica is not available in the UK due to the usual flamboyance of red tape so this is Germains answer.*  
  
So, this variant of Stonehaven, which we think to be rare, is sold as loose (what they call bulk) tobacco here. I picked up 12 oz. The first nice thing I noticed is, they dont use crappy loose jars like American cigar shops. They use sealed containers. The tobacco I got was still moist and FRAGRANT.  It smells like... well, I've never smelled fresh Stonehaven but I imagine it smells like that.   
  
Price... The UK sucks for tobacco taxes, and buying from a B&M means a 20% VAT. It comes out to about 11 dollars per ounce. 11/oz isn't bad considering what a tin of Stone sells for on the secondary market (40+ dollars), but 1.75 oz tin when available (rare) goes for 16.  So it's a good deal compared to Stonehaven but not compared to US bought bulk pipe tobacco.  
   
I don't have a pipe on this trip since it's almost impossible for me to smoke on this kind of business trip. So now I have this pouch that even though it's double sealed still has that.. odd delicious tobacco aroma... This is torture.  
   
So the next time you in the UK, make sure to get some FauxHaven for your friends!  
====================================
Dunning-Kruger-: I am English and I do love my RDF - I'm interested in your views on how similar it is to Esoterica, I've not had Esoterica but I've also heard the idea that RDF is meant to be *our version of Esoterica.


I know exactly what you mean about how we get I over here, my jar of RDF is still gorgeous and I sometimes open it up just to smell it when I'm not even thinking of having a bowl :)

Barracudamagoo: I would love to get my hands on some RDF.  I think the Dutch Pipe Smoker wrote up a review and it is on my list of exotic blends to procure.
