Tobacco Review: Hearth and Home Marble Kake

Review # 87

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home Marble Kake
 
**Description on Tin:** We have wanted to produce our own Virginia-based flake or crumble cake, and the result is Marble Kake. A firmly-pressed blend of Bright and Red Virginias, it comes as a solid piece which can be broken or sliced and rubbed-out, and the flavor changes depending upon how you prepare it. One of our knowledgeable Virginia fans has compared it to Hamborger Veermaster as a smooth, but tasty Virginia blend.

**Leaf:** Brown chunky cake. Reminds me of my college days for some reason… Ignore the word from H&H, this stuff does not burn if you don’t break it down into manageable bits.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Sweet tobacco, raisiny,

**Taste:** Fairly uneventful. Hay, a bit nutty. Some real sweetness after a few puffs – really sweet, I mean the kind of sugar bursts you’d want from a drugstore Aromatic. I really believe smokers on the sugar search would be wise to start chasing Virginias, it takes some time to build the palate, but once that is done, they are much more dependably flavorful than goopy aros. But I digress. Citrus builds, or really tanginess, maybe more white vinegar than lemons or oranges. The nuts and hay recedes. This is really quite good, I was going to write this off as a fairly boring Virigina – what is that, rum raisins? Blackberries! Not maybe Firedance distinct, but the flavor is persistent. This really plays with the big boys. Goes full dark for awhile, dark fruits with a tangy catch. Every so often an ashy puff comes through though. Still quite good stuff. About the final quarter, it fades rapidly back to the original fairly boring hay-nutty taste, fruit and vinegar but a memory. I usually dump it here as the dottle is not worth the chance or the butane fumes.

**Age when smoked:** 13 months

**Nicotine:** 2-3, 

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** You’ll want to rub out or cube this one. If you leave sizable chunks they won’t burn and the taste will be pretty flat. Dry enough to smoke of the jar though.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside but the side stream had a bit of the blackberry smell at least in that beautiful middle third.

**Thoughts:** On first impression I was going to write this off as a fairly bland Virginia, something along the (fresh) MC 5100 or Briar Fox line. When I hit mid bowl I was going to say this was a good, somewhat less robust version of some of my favorite flakes like Orlik Golden Sliced or even Blackwoods, with the combination of the vinegar and dark heavy metal fruit flavors. Not so fast though, as it finishes poorly sometimes. And if you let it get too hot, like on a windy day, it puffs itself out, and while the flavors are still there, they are all muted and shy. 

This is a hard one, I mean how do you rate something that is so varied? I love Dr. Who but some of those episodes are about the worst television I have ever seen – e.g. Robot of Sherwood. If that was my first impression of the show, I would have written off the whole thing. Lou Reed’s oeuvre is littered with some of the best and worst rock music pressed into vinyl, often on the same album, or even within the same song. Anna Karenina drags for long stretches, but the scenes of Levin amongst the serfs scything away is so perfectly written that just mentioning it fills my imagination with the high yellows of deep summer, 19th century rural peasantry filmed in that 70s style overexposed fashion. 

I suppose all of those three examples are things I recommend, maybe not to everyone, maybe with qualifications, but I still think of as good, and I suppose I feel the same way about Marble Kake. It has some rough edges, the boring middle and end, the ashy puff, but for a fairly affordable bulk to hit these notes is pretty impressive.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Briar Fox, MClelland 5100, Carter hall
 
**Summary:** A surprisingly complex plain VA with a vinegar intro and a long plummy middle.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
freepancakesforall: I had the same experience with their Burley Kake. It's... nice. Kind of flavorful, burns sort of ok, but in the end there are many blends I'd smoke/pay for before this again.    

I actually have an ounce of each Marble Kake and Burley Kake and was thinking about rubbing out and making a Burble Kake. Or Marley Kake.

====================================
SupraMario: Awesome review! I gotta give this one a try if it's like 5100.
--
====================================
RustyShackleford09: I wasn't too impressed. Good tobacco, just not my cup of tea. I experienced a very bland smoke, through an entire tin. 
--
antiwittgenstein: How old was it?
--
RustyShackleford09: Maybe a year. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Hmm. Welp. Might be my magical conical bowl, like /u/afiddler intimated.
--
RustyShackleford09: I smoked it through my Virginia pipe. A Larry Roush Dublin with a conical chamber. That was my thought process too. It was a good blend, dont grt me wrong. But it was mundane for my tastes. 
--
====================================
afiddler: I have had a similar experience with it.  I have found that by smoking it in a narrow conical bowl the Virginia varieties no longer blend together as well and it becomes much more interesting.  In wider bowls it's pretty much a uniform sweet and bready flavor with a bit of spice.
