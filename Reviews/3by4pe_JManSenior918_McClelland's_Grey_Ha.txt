McClelland's Grey Havens: A Review
By: JManSenior918

Being a [Tolkien geek,](http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/greyhavens.html) when I first saw this blend on P&C I just had to have it. When I then saw that not only were there no reviews on their own website, but no proper reviews on the sub either, my interest was further piqued. I just received a 100g tin in the mail today with my new MM Legend bent cob and decided I had to dive right in!

**Blend Name:** McClelland's Craftsbury Series: Grey Havens

**Description on tin:** A lightly fragrant Burley and Matured Virginia blend. The rich taste of fine natural tobaccos subtly enhanced with a mellow and pleasing fragrance. Experience smooth Burley flavor with a hint of distinctive Louisiana Perique.

**Leaf:** Loose cut strands of tobacco fill the tin. The strands themselves range in color from light-medium to medium-dark in color and are consistently dispersed throughout the tin so that each pinch should have the same amount of each. Dry enough to smoke straight after being opened without needing to be dried out at all.

**Tin aroma:** I am unable to smell myself and haven't yet had the opportunity to ask someone else what it smells like. Sorry I cannot be of more service here!

**Taste:** I keep a "Nicotine Notebook" in which I write my thoughts and opinions of tobacco products while I am smoking them. Here is what I wrote for this blend:

>This is the second pipe tobacco I have ever tried and I'm very excited at that.It's a little cold for this time of year, but a very nice night for smoking nonetheless. The flavor is much subtler than that of the Erinmore, but I enjoy it very much. My understanding is that this flavor comes from the perique. If this is the case, then give me more! I very much like the ribbon cut and the fact that it is dry enough to smoke straight out of the tin is very convenient. Overall I like this smoke a lot, I'm glad that I ordered the larger tin. In fact, I like it so much I may pack another one right now!

And I did just that. The second bowl smoked much more consistently than the first, likely due to the fact that I packed it better the second time around. The taste is very subtle, so much so that on other forums people said it was like "hot air." However, I very much enjoyed the taste. Sweet and spicy, but not overpowering in the slightest.

**Smokability:** McClelland definitely took their time with this blend so as to do it right. This is the first blend I've had from them, but I must say I am impressed at how well it stayed lit and how perfect the humidity was right out of the tin. It was very easy to smoke, only the tiniest bite if I were to puff too hard, a present but not overwhelming flavor, and little to no nicotine. This could definitely be an all day smoker if someone were to choose to make it so.

**Room Note:** Don't know how to help you guys out here. Next time I'm with pipe smoking friends I'll be sure to hear what they have to say and report back to you.

**Thoughts:** This is not a strong tobacco in any sense of the word, but that does not mean it isn't enjoyable. I enjoyed the subtlety of the different flavors very much and look forward to smoking it again in the next day or so.

**Recommend to:** Anyone who is interested in a light but non-aromatic blend.

**Summary:** I will be smoking this light, easy going blend again soon. I also have a strong inkling that I will be buying another tin once this one runs out. The combination of sweet and spicy is very reminiscent of many "sweet-heat" barbecue items.

**My Background:** I have been smoking cigars with my dad for a few years now, he introduced me to the hobby that he loves so much when I became old enough to legally enjoy it for myself. His father had always enjoyed pipes as well as cigars so I had been curious about what piping was all about and recently decided to find out for myself. I am very new to this hobby and always willing to learn more, if anyone has any thoughts or recommendations please leave them in the comments!

pixeechick: Thanks for the review! I may need to keep this in mind for future purchases myself. Starting to fall for Burley and already love McC VAs, so this sounds up my alley.
