A quick review of English Legacy from /u/briarboy

/u/Briarboy sent me a sample of his English Legacy blend and I wanted to give it a quick review. Please bear with my rambling as I usually don't do these but I had to make an exception.

The blend consists of well aged Latakia, choice Macedonian Oriental, Bright & Red Virginias and a touch of Perique. 

I tried this after eating a charcoal grilled ribeye with a glass of Glenlivet 15 as a digestief. The pairing was phenomenal! 

At first puff it was reminiscent of GLP Maltese Falcon but as I smoked more it's own profile started to shine.  The English Legacy is less peppery and a bit lighter with the Virginias.  The smokiness of the lat complimented the scotch wonderfully!

I would rate the nic hit medium but take that with a large grain of salt as I have a junkie's tolerance to tobacco.

All in all, I would absolutely put his blend up against any of the big dogs. It holds its own. You would be missing out by not trying it.

Thanks for your time!
