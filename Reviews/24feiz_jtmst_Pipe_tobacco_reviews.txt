Hi /r/PipeTobacco, this is my first review of pipe tobacco, and actually my very first time using a pipe.  I'm a long time cigar smoker, and I actually work in a tobacco retail store that operates primarily as a cigar lounge.  I've got a fairly refined pallet for cigar smoking, but I have never given a pipe a shot. The terminology and a lot of the aromas coming from the pipe section of our store are foreign to me.

The reason I'm doing these reviews, is for me to publicly share my journey into pipe tobacco smoking, while hopefully getting some critique, feedback, and guidance from the /r/PipeTobacco community along the way.  Being well versed in other forms of tobacco, from vaping to cigars, I still feel I will never be able to call myself a proper tobacconist until I've familiarized myself with your world. On the the Reviews!

Tonight I smoked Lane RLP-6, which descriptions reads as follows:

 "Blended with just the right proportion of Golden Virginia and Burley, the basic blend of Toasted Cavendish tobaccos takes on a zesty dimension. This mixture gets better as you smoke it all day long."

Great. I don't know what any of that means, and I also will not look at any other reviews of this tobacco until after I've completed this one. It's easy to think that a tobacco tastes of "coffee, leather, and earth" if you read a review that tells you that's what it tastes like. Here are my notes;


Construction (Is this even the right word? Consistency may be a better way to describe it, but I digress) : Of the three tobaccos that I bought, this one had the largest variation in both size and color of the tobacco flakes.  Fairly moist, but not enough so that I had any trouble lighting, or maintaining a light.

Aroma:  The aroma that the tobacco puts off, both in the bag and through the smoke, is fairly sweet, with the most identifiable notes being cherry, honey, and smoked wood.

Flavor:  This is where I began to think that I screwed something up, because largely the flavor wasn't there.  I I read the tutorials on the side bar for packing and lighting, and seemed to all go smoothly.  I was getting good puffs of smoke but for the first third of the pipe or so, it seemed more like I was just getting flavorless air, and maybe even getting a stronger plastic taste from the new pipe than I was getting tobacco.  Almost halfway in I started screwing around, tamping the tobacco and re-lighting, and around the half way mark I started to get somewhere.  Predominant notes of wood, maybe hickory and mesquite, accompanied by some light notes of sweetness, vanilla.  I was unable to taste any of the cherry that I thought I smelled so boldly in the aroma of the smoke.


Being as this is my first foray into pipe smoking, its hard to say what to call the strength of body and flavor in the tobacco. If I were to venture a guess I'd call the body as a mild, and flavor as a mild-medium.  I'll chalk up the lack of flavor to operator error, do some more research and try this tobacco again soon.  I have a rule with cigars, where I will not make form a true final opinion on a stick until I've tried it on three separate occasions, and I think I'll take the same approach on pipe tobacco.  I hope to do more of these, and also get some feedback, so if you note anything I did was wrong, found my tasting notes completely off base, think the review was too wordy, or have any further recommendations, let me know.
 


====================================
crimsonrat: Good review, man, and a damn sight better than one I could do. I think it's pretty close to the template, as well.

On the flavor, and this is my opinion only, 99% of the time aromatics taste like hot air but smell great in the jar and in a room. They never taste like they smell to me, and are often flavorless. 
--
jtmst: That would explain it, I'll keep that in mind as I try any more aromatics.  A bit disappointing though, as it smells fantastic. Maybe one to smoke when the wife is around, she'll probably enjoy the aroma more than I enjoy the smoke.
--
====================================
LegesAequitas: I think this is an excellent first foray into the world of pipe tobacco. Ultimately, I wouldn't be upset at not finding a lot of flavor in the Lane RLP-6 after the first smoke. I also tried an aromatic style blend first and had an equally difficult time really finding the flavor that was supposed to be present. After every successive try of the same tobacco I was able to get more out of it and now i definitely do like aromatics. On the other hand, some people just aren't fans of aromatics because it is a tobacco style that can require very gentle smoking and a subtle palate to find the flavor. They would claim that they sure have extremely pleasing room notes, but they lack flavor and give you nasty tongue bite (which they can do if smoked too quickly).

You come from a cigar background, aromatics will be very different from that kind of tobacco smoking; conversely, English style tobacco can be somewhat more similar and many cigar smokers find that it's much more to their liking. That Newminster English Orient might be a good way to ease you into things in a more familiar way.

Overall, my main tip to anyone is to take it very slowly if you are looking to pick up the flavor. Many single bowls take me an hour or even more to smoke to completion, and the longer I take the more I usually enjoy it.
--
jtmst: What you're saying about gentle smoking helping to bring along the subtle flavors with aromatics makes a lot of sense.  I tried to take it nice and slow, but for a bit when I was really trying to pull flavor out of it, I was probably puffing away much quicker than I would have liked.

I forgot to put that in the initial review, the smoke time.  That bowl took me about 45 minutes, but next time I'll be sure to take it easy and try to enjoy the subtle flavors, instead of trying to force and pull out bold ones.  Thanks for the tips.
--
LegesAequitas: It's not a problem. Remember that it was your first try so it's not really an issue. A pretty fair number of pipe smokers never like and never will like aromatics so you could very well fall into that category, but I would hazard a few more bowls though just to make sure. As /u/antiwittgenstein said, pipe tobacco, especially aromatic tobacco, is "often a shyer creature" than cigars. Even so, there are some tobaccos that knock my socks off with strong flavor and nicotine. I think there is something out there for everyone if they're willing to look and to sample.
--
poops_in_public: I completely agree with LegesAequitas and simply want to add one more note. The initial charring/lighting of a pipe can start a smoke off on the hot side. A technique that I typically employ with aromatics is I will do the initial charring light and tamping then set the pipe down for a half hour or so to cool before smoking it. This usually allows me a cooler smoke from the start and enable me to get more of the flavor.
--
jtmst: I'll give that a try when I light one up later tonight. Thanks for the tip.

====================================
blenheim45: There are basically two reason to put cavendish into a pipe mixture: 1) unflavored cavendish is a very mild tasting component, and takes away any  rough edges a blend might exhibit; 2) cavendish is very easy to flavor, it accepts the flavoring agents readily.

as noted many of the flavors are much more noticeable in the room note, than in the mouth and nose.  this makes the flavored tobaccos more socially friendly than some their unflavored counterparts to other in the vicinity of the pipe smoker.

to many pipe smokers the cheap aros are the equivalent of "Old Ports" in the cigar trade.  there are aros made with better tobacco, just as not every small cigar is an "Old Port" or its ilk, and with the better ones you can get the room note and a taste of the underlying tobaccos.  If you are in the US, go into any store like a Meijer's and you will see in their tobacco selection big plastic bags of pipe tobacco, generally really cheap, with a label like "Super Value" Cherry Cavendish.  It must have a market, they keep selling the stuff, but it is very cheap tobacco covered with heavy flavoring, and smokes hotter than the coals of hell.  You can get a quality aro, like say one of the Solani blends, made with good tobacco, and with flavors you can taste (both the tobacco and the casing), but you are unlikely to get a bargain, because they still used good tobacco as the base.

Readily available almost everywhere are the 7 Seas blends and the Captain Black blends, they use decent, if not outstanding tobacco, and you can taste the flavoring and smell it.  I find the Capt. Black Red is overpowering in its Cherry, like taking a slug of a kid's cherry cough syrup.  I think I had one bowl before it went into the failed blend jar, which a good many of keep, to hopefully let the failures mix and be magically transformed  into something that is greater than its parts.

Good review by the way.

jtmst: Very informative, thank you.   I'm going to take my time smoking my way through the tobaccos available at my B&M, which are mostly the tobacco brands that are associated with cigar companies (Sutliff, Peterson, and Drew Estate),to get an idea of what tobaccos create which flavors. We have Captain Black as well, I'll be sure to pick some up on my next trip.  Eventually I'd like to get into creating some blends for the shop, but thats likely a little ways away.

Thanks for the feedback.

blenheim45: CB was where I started smoking, but not where I ended up.  I only occasionally sit in the aro pew, tending more towards English and balkan blends, and entirely different part of the tobacco taste spectrum. LOL  Most of the tobacco blenders are associated with cigars, if not directly then at the wholesale level, as the sales reps are going to the same places, so this gives them more to sell.  Sutliff now is a separate entity from Altadis Cigar, because the pipe end felt that they were lost in the shuffle, and cigars is where the market is currently focused, and cigars represent more dollars to retailers and distributers a like.  2 cigars at $5 each is an equal sale to one tin of tobacco , which for the casually constant pipe smoker may represent a week's smoking.  and $5 cigars are very modest sticks, with many selling for much more.  A heavy pipe smoker may be two ins a week, which does not balance out a cigar smoker who has one a day, let alone the heavier smoker who does 2 or 3 sticks a day, or more.   it is always money.
blending is an interesting proposition, which I have never tried.  i have known a few blenders, it is a bit like cooking.  You have people who are good cooks, and then you have the people who instead of following recipes they write them.  
Cornell and Diehl list over a 120 English blends.  now some of those are double listings as a blend might come in more than one size, but it probably represents over 80 distinctly different recipes, which is like having that many different recipes for cherry pie.  and they have similar numbers for the other categories Va., Burley, Va-per, va-bur and so on.
and with aros, the sky is the limit.  Almost any promising flavor combination is out there.  You want rum, mango, and pineapple ... some probably makes it.  Want apple, cinnamon, and creme cocoa, and the next question is likely to be with or without a touch of allspice. LOL

happy tasting.

FlashCrashBash: Give it some more smokes. It should click. Cigar smokers always have problems like this. Cigars wake you up with the flavor bomb they light under your arse.

Pipe tobacco is generally milder and dare I say a bit deeper. You just have to acclimate yourself and your palette to getting the most of out milder tobacco.
--
None: This is exactly it. I started out on pipes, but switched to cigars solely because their flavors were readily available. But once I picked my pipes up again and really focused on finding the flavors, and opening up my palette to the different tastes of pipe tobacco, I found it much more rewarding than cigars. 
--
====================================
poops_in_public: One other factor to consider that I have not seen mentioned yet is if you're smoking a new pipe (which is likely), is they take a bit of smoking to get "broken in." What this means is that from repeated use, a carbonized "cake" forms inside the pipe bowl. A cake layer helps keep the smoke cooler and enhances the flavor especially if the cake was formed with the same tobacco. A brand new pipe will usually have a more mooted flavor until then.
--
jtmst: This pipe is probably going to get used to sample all the different tobacco's, just to help me figure out what I like before i start buying and designating different pipes.  How long are we talking about to get a good cake formed?
--
poops_in_public: It depends. Some tobaccos form cake faster than others (like burley) and also on whether the inside of the bowl was pre-carbonized or not.  I've never really counted but I'd estimate ~20 bowls.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Welcome to the other side! I am also a new convert from the cigar world - but I doubt with 1/10th your expertise. Pipe tobacco is often a shyer creature than say, Nub Cameroon or Punch Bareknuckle. There you are slapped in the face with flavors, and as long as the construction is fair, you don't have to (get to) fiddle with your smoking apparatus. 

I am increasingly of the opinion that the new smoker should avoid aromatics if at all possible. They are often (but not always) liars - smelling great in the jar, swell in the air, but like you said, taste like nothing. But since you have it, you can always smoke through it while you perfect your packing, tamping, and cadence.

English and Virginia-perique blends are more upfront. Aggressive. Insulting even. I had my first bowl of Dunhill 965 tonight. There was no fruitless quest for flavors, more of a physical and emotional onslaught.

I'm looking forward to hearing your other reviews, and once again, welcome!
--
jtmst: This makes me excited for the English Oriental that I picked up.  An emotional onslaught of flavor (dibs on on that as my band name) is exactly what I'm looking for.
