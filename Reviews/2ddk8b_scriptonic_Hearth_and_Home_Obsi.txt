Hearth and Home Obsidian Review
By: scriptonic
---
**Description On Tin:** Obsidian – Stoved Virginia, Latakia, toasted black Cavendish and Perique are indistinguishably balanced to provide sweet and spicy smoke.

**Leaf/Looks:** Very coarse cut, very dark. From just a glance you might think that it was pure Cavendish.

**Tin Aroma/Smell**: A nice classic smoky smell that you would expect from an English blend, while underlying you can smell a touch of the sweetness from the Cavendish. A lot of times tin notes on English’s are compared to camp fires, with this blend I’d say it’s the very beginning of a fire that is just getting started. You get that smoky smell but it is not over powering.

**Taste:** It’s a very mild English blend, if you are wanting a Latakia bomb this is not the tobacco for you. You get the Latakia more on the retro-hale along with a touch of spice from the Perique. When smoking you get the sweetness you would expect form a stoved Virginia and Cavendish blend.
Smoke Ability: Cool burning smoke, no drying time needed. It burns smooth and slow, no bite.

**Summary:** Really nice mild English blend, it is not super Latakia heavy and the Perique is very subtle while the sweetness of the Virginia and Cavendish comes through. If you are looking to start transitioning to English blends I think this would be a fantastic one to do so with. The Latakia is not strong enough to make you gag and have to go grab a barf bag.
Background: I’m a huge English Latakia bomb fan, the more the better, but at the same time I thoroughly enjoy Virginia Flakes and from time to time the occasional aromatic. 

**Pipe Smoked In:** Handmade Stanwell from the registration era, shape 71 Sixten Ivarsson design.

**Drying Time:** None

**Rating**: 7/10

scriptonic: bah its new. only have like 3 videos up. But with recent change of events I have time to kill so why not right?
--
LegesAequitas: Go for it. Sounds good to me.

KanpaiWashi: And here I thought youtube pipe channels were frowned upon.  But if /u/scriptonic can say he has one, I'll come out and say I have one, too!  It's pretty fun to do it and the youtube pipe community is pretty awesome.  

BTW, just subbed to you.

scriptonic: IDK if they are frowned upon or not....I'm not actively trying to promote it or nothing, just posting a video link for people that rather watch than read kind of thing.
--
KanpaiWashi: Yeah I figured.  I just remember one time in IRC chat, someone asked about it and the topic was shot down.  lol.

scriptonic: hmmmm  I dont think i was there for that...interesting. btw subbed
