[Review] C&D - Speakeasy
By: crimblade
---
**Blend Name:** C&D Speakeasy

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** From the roar of jazz music to the revel of old and new friends alike, New Orleans' speakeasies are not subtle establishments to say the least.

With colorful cocktails lining the bar and wisps of smoke dancing the dim light, these retro bars embody that daring spirit of one of the city's most iconic eras â€” something Cornell & Diehl sought to capture in their bold, Cellar Series take on the traditional Navy flake: Speakeasy Navy Blend.

Estimated peak: 10-15 years.

**Leaf:** Kentucky, Perique, Virginia. Broken flakes of fairly uniform brown color with flecks of lighter color. Perfect moisture level for smoking straight from the tin.

**Tin Aroma:** Dark fruit, earthy hay, the barest suggestion of rum.

**Taste:** Earthy. Mildly sweet with a nice woody flavor. There's barely any hint of spice from the perique however it does give the blend a delicious dark fruit flavor. There is the occasional hint of rum flavor and sweetness melding the flavors together. Really balanced flavors throughout with the earthy, woody goodness of the Kentucky growing as the bowl progresses. The rum flavor never really fades and remains a background component throughout the smoke. This is a rather complex smoke that has somehow found balance despite it's immaturity. 

**Smokability:** Excellent. Super easy to pack in various different ways. Whether it be fully rubbed out or doing a modified fold and stuff this blend is a nice easy smoke. Make sure you a lot enough time for it as this blend burns nice and slow. This is one of the few where i can legitimately smoke to the bottom the bowl without getting even a hint of ash or wet dottle. Relights are required occasionally but do not in anyway detract from the enjoyment of the smoke.

**Room Note:** Pretty similar to the taste, earthy and woody. No hint of the rum. It doesn't stand out in anyway other than being mildly pleasant. 

**Thoughts:** Being one of the cellar blends put out by C&D I would have thought that it would be mediocre at best with less than a year under it's belt. On top of that I've never really seen the appeal of navy blends. Usually they're so heavy with rum and mediocre tobacco that you end up with tongue burn on top of an unsatisfying, uninteresting smoke. I actually picked this one up because it seemed fairly similar to Sixpence in it's description that I figured, why not? I'm really glad I did. I can't even imagine what 10 years will do to the quality and balance of this blend. I do know that it's become the jar I most often reach for in the past month because it's just a good summer smoke. On top of that it has a slightly over medium nic hit so you end up in a blissful state of relaxation for the 1+ smoke time it will give you. Still I can't help but feel a certain dismay knowing that it's life could be limited thanks to the FDA deeming regs. I do know that I will be cellaring as much of this as my budget will allow. It's just that good.

**Recommend to:** If you enjoy Sixpence this blend gives a similar and yet different view on the Kentucky Va/Per mashup. If you're looking for an alcohol topped blend where the alcohol isn't the main player.

**Summary:** It's good stuff. I keep trying to find something about it that I disagree with and I really can't. Between the ready to smoke straight from the tin to the great smokability it's just a great blend for those warmer days. Dare I even mention the rainy evenings with the blues playing softly in the background?

**Drink Pairings:**  Water, whiskey on the rocks, a good red ale. 

**Final Rating:** 4/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Great review. Definitely picking up a tin.

crimblade: You won't regret it! My biggest problem now is figuring out how many I'll need to stash so I have a decent amount when they hit their sweet spot in 10 years.

====================================
hicetnunc37: why is Acadian  so under rated on this forum. Its probably the best vaper out there. I'll pick up a tin of this stuff, since we have similar  taste. Have you tried Pegasus?
--
crimblade: I've no idea, Acadian Perique is the metric by which I judge all other Va/Pers it's just so good. I have not tried Pegasus but I'll certainly add it to my wish list!

====================================
chewsyourownadv: I'm a little tempted now. Always on the lookup for a good rum blend. Have you tried Navigator? Sextant? Haddo's Delight? C&D's limited release Beast?
--
crimblade: Navigator and Sextant are both on my radar but I have yet to pull the trigger on them. 

Haddo's delight I enjoy occasionally. Its flavor is much lighter than Speakeasy, I'm also not a big fan of the after smell of it, other wise it's a good smoke. 

The Beast I enjoy in moderation. I still have some left from the tin I picked up last summer and it's still an enjoyable occasional smoke. I enjoy it a lot more now that it's aged a bit and am actually a little disappointed I didn't grab two tins when it was around.

Out of the three I like Speakeasy the most.

====================================
mgvsquared: I wasn't thrilled with Speakeasy, but I will say Bourbon Bleu is my favorite VaPer right now. Your review has given me at least a notion to reconsider and try Speakeasy again. I too am not the hugest Navy fan, but the fact that this is in the Cellar Series is worth at least putting it back for a few years and trying again down the line.
