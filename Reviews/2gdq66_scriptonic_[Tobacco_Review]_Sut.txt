[Tobacco Review] Sutliff - Kasimir (English Blend)
By: scriptonic
---
**Blend:** Sutliff – Kasimir

**Blend Type:** Aro/English

**Ingredients:** Burley, Latakia, Oriental/Turkish, Virginia

**Description On Tin:** A complex blend of Latakia, Orientals, Virginia and Burley cube for the true connoisseur.

**Leaf/Looks:** Very course cut, good amount of Latakia

**Tin Aroma/Smell**:  Pretty damn smoky, a hint of a light fragrance most likely from the Oriental’s. Sweet on the top of the nose

**Taste:** Very creamy. Lat heavy on first light. I’d say this is a medium English. Slightly sweet from the Virginia, not grassy though. The Virginias are a background noise compared to the burley and lat. The Orientals give it a slight floral smell/taste. As I got deeper into the bowl the burleys became the main player. Real nuttiness and creaminess coming through on the smoke. The Latakia took a back seat and was only dominant in the retro hale. 

**Smoke Ability:** Pretty damn perfect. No issues, this blend will smoke down to white ash without any re-lights and proper tamping technique 

**Summary:** This is a damn good blend, since the tobaccos are cut differently depending on how you pack it you’ll have a different experience each time. The burleys are a high quality and I did not even get the hint of bite from them. I REALLY like this tobacco. I’m going to pick up a tin and let it age for a year and come back to this. This pair perfectly on a cold fall morning with my coffee.

**Background:** I’m a huge English Latakia bomb fan, the more the better, but at the same time I thoroughly enjoy Virginia Flakes and from time to time the occasional aromatic. 

**Pipe Smoked In:** 1970’s Ben Wade (Preben Holm era) Golden Walnut Freehand

**Drying Time:** 20-25minutes

**Rating**: 7.5 out of 10 (where 5 being meh, its good, but don’t go out of your way to pick any up)

tankbuster183: Finally opened mine and had a few bowls and totally agree.  I am always underwhelmed with Sutliff blends, so this was a nice surprise.
