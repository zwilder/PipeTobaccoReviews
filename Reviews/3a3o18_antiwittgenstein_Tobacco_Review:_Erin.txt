Review #39

**Blend Name:** Erin Go Bragh

**Description on Tin:** A brilliant mixture of flue-cure Virginias, toasted white Burleys, and sweet Black Cavendish spiked with aged Irish Whiskey. Refined and mellow with an inviting aroma.
 
**Leaf:** Uniform brown ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Yeasty raisin bran.
 
**Taste:** Minty? Slightly sweet. Caramel. Toasty, warm tobacco. A bit like honey-wheat bread. Thatâ€™s about the size of this one.

**Nicotine:** Very light.

**Smokability:** Give it a bit of time to dry, pack it loosely, it will behave admirably.
 
**Room Note:** Toasty, warm, not unpleasant.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed this one, which was surprising considering how mono-dimensional it is. I am not gonna load up a monster bowl and puff on this for days, but a spot of it in my tiny aro bowl is a fun 15-20 minutes. It captures the toasty, bready nature of plain burley, much like Prince Albert, however this has an extra helping of sweetness which makes it a bit more interesting. I love mixing or layering bowls with PA, and I think Erin Go Bragh might also serve in that capacity.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Prince Albert, Sutliff Golden Slices, Carter Hall

**Summary:** A straightforward bready-sweet burley smoke.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**++

hvywldrnss: This is definitely one of my least favorite tobaccos... but now your review makes me want to try it again. I don't remember an otc burley taste at all... fascinating.

antiwittgenstein: There is always the possibility I have a brain disorder I don't know about, but that's what I got out of it. I had heard not so great things about this one, so my low expectations really helped out how much I liked it, in the way that impossible to get or pricey tobaccos usually make me feel let down.

chevelleuga: I've got a pouch of that I got while it was on sale from P&C. I enjoy it on occasion, it has a good flavor. Will try drying it a bit next time and see how it performs. 
Great review!!

antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate! as /u/dryyourtobacco always says 'Always dry your tobacco.' Even dry to the touch blends, like C&D stuff, benefits from a few minutes of drying.
