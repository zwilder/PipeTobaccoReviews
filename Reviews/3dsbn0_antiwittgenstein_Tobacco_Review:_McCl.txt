Tobacco Review: McClelland Mocha Black

Review #45

**Blend Name:**McClelland Mocha Black (No. 620)

**Description on Tin:** For those who enjoy the cool-smoking characteristics of a steamed black Cavendish, but don't like overly-sweet blends, No. 620 Mocha Black might just be the ticket. This Burley-based black tobacco is imbued with rich, deep notes of black coffee and deep dark chocolate.
 
**Leaf:** Just like I like my coffee, black and wet.
 
**Tin Aroma:** A Starbucks iced mocha latte – with a strong vanilla presence, and a touch of Cavendish’s elegant tobacco aroma. 
 
**Taste:** Sweet. Black Cavendish flavor. Some light vanilla. When dried out just right – for a very, very long time - when smoked at the right pace – always slower than you want – it has a distinct coffee flavor. Coffee not how I take it, but with cream and sugar and a little spritz of vanilla.

**Nicotine:** I think this is one of the those nicotine free tobaccos. 

**Smokability:** Rather wet. Dry aggressively. Stir. Dry again. Maybe put it front of a fan. Under a lamp. In a kiln or tandoori. When you dry it enough, it really brings out the taste. When you don’t, you get very bitey hot air.
 
**Room Note:** Rich tobacco, sweet vanilla, a touch of cocoa and coffee. Superb.

**Thoughts:** Impressed with the McClelland line, I thought I would try on of their aromatics, hoping it would be an improvement over what I have had from Lane, MacBaren, and Sutliff. Unfortunately –as you know by now – it was not. A classic Type I aromatic – Cavendish cased or topped – it was hard to light, went out when I diverted my attention the slightest, liked to bite me, and was scotch with the flavors. When you hit things just right - enough drying time, slow cadence, good light – it has a steady, slightly sweet coffee. The rest of the 95% of the time you will spend with this leaf will be in boredom or agony. This tobacco is Estella from Great Expectations – a few flashes of kindness in a sea of misery. Or if you prefer something more lowbrow, the career of Adam Sandler. Any metaphor you like, the suffering is not worth the joy on this one.

Maybe if I had not had Firedance Flake, I would have thought more kindly of this. But I have seen the gilded halls of the gods and now the works of man seem but squalor and makedo.

**Similar Tobaccos:** MacBaren 7 Seas, Captain Black, Sutliff Aromatics

**Summary:** A bitey coffee dipped black Cavendish, than when you are lucky, tastes like cream and sugared coffee.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** +/-

Cycleoflife: Thanks for the review. I will avoid this PITA blend for sure. Aromatics never seem to deliver for me, not even the firedance. I only keep them around for the room note when I smoke around others. 

Me thinks you need some better coffee in your life? I can't say I've heard of Intelligentia, but when Starbucks comes in at number 2... well.

antiwittgenstein: I tried to keep the coffee to things that are recognized through most of America. Intellgenstia might only be in LA and Chicago though, which is cheating, but blows every other cup of coffee I have had out of the water, so it is obviously +++++, couldn't be better. 

There is some small batch stuff I have had from both coasts, and even a local place, which is pretty great, but Starbucks, when it is made properly, can hang in there. Just like with pipe tobacco and whiskey, I am a coffee enthusiast, but not a snob. I try to think the best cup of coffee I have had is one I am drinking at that moment.

It is a shame about Firedance. It really paid out for me in a way that I couldn't get any other aro to sing. It is pretty obviously they aren't near to my heart, but I figured I ought to review the ones I have and spread the word.

Cycleoflife: Great answer. I'll talk shit on Starbucks all year long until I find myself driving through Oklahoma or some such place and Starbucks becomes a glowing oasis; a Mount Olympus where black ambrosia flows from silver urns to please the gods of my addiction. I shut up pretty quickly then. I am blessed/spoiled with an exceptional roaster in my small town. 

As for the Firedance, I only gave it two tries to be fair. It's topping was just too much for me. Have you ever tried MacBaren Modern Virginia? I got a free sample with a SP order and I really enjoy it. Very light on the topping. 

I do appreciate the reviews, especially the ever changing rating scale. So thank you.

antiwittgenstein: Pro Tip: If you have the time, you can have any coffee they have in the shop in a French Press. 

I have not. I am just now really exploring MacBaren. I have their No. 1 Virginia - which I am not allowed to get into until I have reviewed all my samples. So I don't do this for you, I do this out of penance for my tobacco-greed.

And thanks - the rating scale is the hardest part to write - and usually the most contentious set of opinions.
