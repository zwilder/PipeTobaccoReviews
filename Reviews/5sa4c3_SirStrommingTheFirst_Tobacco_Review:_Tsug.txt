Tobacco Review: Tsuge, First Days of Spring.

I've always admired Tsuge pipes. The sheer craftsmanship of pipes from the Japanese market have a uniquely astounding look to them that I just cannot get over. Elegant shapes with a traditional Japanese flair seem to provide for a marvelous take.

But what of their blends? I have to say that it had me curious as to the quality of how it could be on their tobaccos? Well I took a shot with an order to Smokingpipes and decided to buy some Tsuge!



**Blend Name**: First Days of Spring

**Description on Tin**: No true tin description... however, Smokingpipes offers you a very light and lovely Japanese poem to sum up the nature of the blend.

**Leaf**: Burley gives the blend it's backbone and Virginia gives the blend a nice natural sweetness, while some Perique in the blend help to provide some spiciness to liven it up a bit. Everything is in a very nice ribbon cut that was perfectly moist out of the tin.

**Tin Aroma**: The tin aroma holds a top note of Plum and the sweetness akin to that of Virginia tobaccos. The finish on the nose is reminiscent of flowers and citrus with a subtle Perique hint of spiciness on it.

**Taste**: This aromatic holds barely ANY of the aromas that are on the nose for this on the palate. If anything you might get a tinge of plum or citrus here and there, but that taste usually mixes with the tobacco to make it a tad floral-esque.

**Smokability**: I have to admit that this is a very easy to smoke aromatic. The only downside to it is that I notice it takes quite a bit of relighting, which can be a fair pain in the arse.
Room Note: Sweet plum lingers on the nose before dissipating into a bit of a citrus/floral scent. At least a good chunk of it is mostly the plum aroma. 

**Thoughts**: I have to say that this blend is actually quite good. As I mentioned before, the only bone I have to pick with it is that the relighting is a bit of a pain in the ass. The one major lure point for me on this once I cracked the tin was that subtle flowery note to it. I find it to be such a hard thing to find tobaccos with floral tastes. Other than that, it is a great mellow blend that is great at any time. But as the name implies, it really is a blend that would be best enjoyed in Spring.

**Recommend to**: This blend is good for people who like their aromatics to be more NATURAL in fruit flavours, or if they seek something that has a bit of a floral punch to it. I have to say the one allure of this for me is that it does have that sort of flowery taste to it. If you're not a fan of floral flavours, you don't really have to worry because it is something that is so subtle on the palate that you hardly notice it.

**Summary**: Gotta say it is a great blend. The natural flavours of fruit at their earliest point makes it all the more tantalizing on the tongue, with the light flavour of blossoms making it a truly quintessential blend for the turn of seasons. Definite 8/10 for this blend!
====================================
Doc_Hooligan: If it's floral you want, try Ennerdale. While my experience with Lakelands is limited, I really enjoyed that one. I've had a few of the Tsuge tobaccos - mostly from their four seasons line - and while I wasn't terribly impressed, I wasn't disappointed, either.
