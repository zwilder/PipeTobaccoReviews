Gauging interest on setting up a mystery review.
By: misterzipp0
---
The idea came up to do mystery reviews for the community and I wanted to throw this thread out there to foster a discussion on it and have a mod weigh in regarding logistics and money.

The basic premise is as follows:

From the 20th to the 31st we open up a sign up period where you send the organizer ~$10 (tbd) and then they will make a bulk purchase of the blends and then distribute them to everyone.  Turn around should happen by the middle of the month and then reviews should be in by the end of the month.  Dates are arbitrary, I don't want this to compete with the monthly review.

The goal is to guess the blend by tasting and writing out a description in the comments, hence the mystery review.

I'd like to have some incentive for this but unsure of how to handle multiple winners, etc.

Mods: how does this work from a money standpoint?  I'm fine with full transparency because I'm sure that not every penny of each participants' $10 would be spent on tobacco,postage,envelopes,zip locks, etc.  

How do folks feel about rewarding the organizer for their time? Depending on the size of this it could take an afternoon or a weekend to pull off.  While it's done to foster community participation I do think there should be something in it since it's a physical handling of all the steps and materials.  If this is out of line please voice that opinion.

How many blends do you want to see in your mystery envelope each month?  English and other? (Non aro)

What are your thoughts on prizes? How is a winner picked?

1-10 what's your interest in this? 
1: bug off! 
5:that sounds good and I'd like to see the results without participating
10: take my money 

If there's interest in this I'd like to see this happen by next month so share your thoughts.

====================================
misterzipp0: Some back of the envelope math on my lunch time today shows that if we could get 30 people (lofty goal) interested everyone would receive two half oz samples (one English blend and one other blend) to review and that would give us enough left over (after shipping and supplies) to award a $75 gift card to the winner who guessed blend 1 and $75 to blend 2.

If we hit a more realistic target of 20 people it would still be a $40 gift card.

If we have multiple winners we would have to come up with something... Thoughts?

NinjaThor: Does this include giving the organizer a little bit for the trouble? I would not want the person putting all this together to come out empty handed. 
--
Pipezilla: Yeah, the one setting this up deserves some $$ or maybe he/she can get a tin or 2 when they order for their trouble? 
--
misterzipp0: That's going to be dependent on the amount of participants. You're the first to address it, what would be fair?
--
NinjaThor: Yes. Even though it's a fun community based thing whoever takes the time and energy to do it should get something outta it. I think a tin of tobacco or like a 10$ gift card would be good as a prize. With whoever organizes the thing taking whatever is left over. It will only be like $25-50 bucks.

Also if there were multiple people who guessed it we could always do a RNG based name picker to see who gets the prize.

Im not even studying the prize really. I just think the blind taste testing and reviews would be great.
--
misterzipp0: I'm onboard with that

====================================
V1ld0r_: Decent shipping cost to Europe: 9
Else, I'm a solid 5, maybe 6(participate every now and then but not always). 
--
moebbels: Same here
--
====================================
ryanwhodat: I'm down for sure. I'm starting to build my pallette a bit, so this would be awesome. 
--
====================================
claypainter: 8 - but I think that every month would be a bit over kill.

--
misterzipp0: Agreed. My thoughts are a trial run at this and then maybe once a quarter.
--
V1ld0r_: 4X a year might help some 5\6's from Europe to participate on every event :) 
--
misterzipp0: I'd be open to including Europe but we would have to elect a point person to handle the distribution.
--
V1ld0r_: That actually might not be economically smart. 
Often is more expensive to ship one big parcel than very small ones. Also because of import taxes. Most EU countries have a very small limit on tax exemption. 

Giving my country as example, if I receive any parcel that the estimated cost is over 20€ (+/- 21USD) I'll pay at least 3€ (flat fee)+23% of the estimated package cost, including shipping!
E.G: 
Parcel cost = 17€
Shipping cost = 5€

I'll pay: 3€+5.29€ = 8.29€ 

--
misterzipp0: Good point. I guess it would depend on how many are interested then.  Any duties on a 2oz package?

What's the shipping cost for 2oz from smokingpipes.com to your location?
--
V1ld0r_: That would be ~4USD (assuming it comes in a rectangular letter envelope with total weight of 3oz). 
--
misterzipp0: OK, I would have to look into it more but it looks like for a few more dollars ($3 or $4 USD) we could get some European participants.

Any restrictions on sending some unmarked tobacco in a zip lock bag in a plain envelope?  Customs forms, taxes, etc to be aware of?

If it is as simple as putting it in an envelope and sending it I would be OK but if it gets too much more involved I would feel bad if I screw something up and lose some shipments.
--
V1ld0r_: To Portugal, it's a nightmare. You need a lot of papers and etc. I'm lucky to have friends in more friendly countries that forward ship it to me and save me some good headaches. 

This really depends on the country, sorry. Can't give you a straight, simple answer. However, from what I know, most countries it wouldnt be a problem.

====================================
jackdhadi: 10 here.  Sounds like a good way to start a cellar. 
--
====================================
landon9560: 6 or 7 on the interest scale, but how will you collect the money? paypal? another random money collection service? send through the mail system? (this last one is what I would likely vote for, you get addresses to sent stuff to, and people wouldn't have to worry about their cards, not to mention I don't use a credit card, I usually go out and buy a prepaid.)

~10 USD seems like a decent price for a couple different tobaccos and a chance to win something at the end of the month, use any spare money left over for something like a pipe stand, tamper, or a mystery cigar, if you get enough people interested in this, maybe even a random pipe for the winner. (that would be an interesting idea, first month, no winners, just a mystery cigar sent out to everyone who participated)
--
misterzipp0: Probably PayPal F&F for collection.  
--
====================================
Pipezilla: 10!!!!!

I'm down.

1/2 ounce samples?






--
====================================
PeskyPrussian: Yes, 10.  This would be a great way to get people involved in tasting and reviewing.
--
====================================
NinjaThor: 10! Sign me up! I think it's a great idea. 
--
====================================
VonSausage: 8
--
====================================
kohaan: Definitely a 10. I think it sounds like a great idea
--
====================================
Mrtheboss2: I definitely say 10. I have some friends who are not in Reddit who would probably join just to participate in this.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: I have a great deal of interest and will kick the money in (10), but I feel like I should recuse myself from the contest.
--
misterzipp0: I think it would be an interesting test to see if you can match the component flavors to a blend. I'm not going to pick blends that get a lot of airplay on here.
--
====================================
Jackburt0: From Sydney Australia here,  am definitely interested. However,  due to not having tried every blend,  perhaps a guess the components instead of guess the name of the blend? 
--
misterzipp0: Half the fun is trying to guess it.  Most folks could prob guess a VaPer.  We could maybe narrow down the brand...
--
====================================
Pipezilla: It seems like we should give everyone a month to get the $ to the contact person... then say another month to get the tobacco back to the people who are participating... every 2 months sounds decent?  Like someone already mentioned, quarterly...

I think some people will say yes, then when it come down to it will pass... like the box pass... the participants will need to be 100% in.
--
misterzipp0: I'd like to keep the signup window short, 1-2 wks tops.  I find that when you drag things out interest wanes.  We can make the announcement ahead of time to give a heads up but a short window is best.
--
V1ld0r_: I would short it out to 1week sign-up & payment (or 9 days, from one Saturday to the next Sunday, so two full weekend and 1 full week). 

Then one month for shipping and handling? 

--
misterzipp0: Time frame sounds good, I think once a quarter would be enough if the trial run proves a success.  I'll prob ship as a batch and then everyone has a few weeks to work through the samples.
--
====================================
tochrais: 8 - seems like a great idea and a fun game for the community.
