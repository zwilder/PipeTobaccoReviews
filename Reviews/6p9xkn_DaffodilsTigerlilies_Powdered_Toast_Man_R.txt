Blend Name: Powdered Toast Man

Description on Tin: Powdered Tooaast Maaaan!!!

Leaf: Ribbon Cut

Tin Aroma: Buttery Sweet Toasty

Taste: Light while simultaneously thick, rich, and creamy. Last 1/2-3/4 was peppery without burn.

Smokability: Very very good.

Room Note: Good

Thoughts: See Summary below.

Recommend to: Anyone, noobs and experienced alike.

Summary: This tobacco was somehow simultaneously light and thick rich and creamy. I didn't taste the cinnamon, but I believe this was more my palate than any failing in the tobacco. Somewhere between half and three quarters of the way down the bowl, the pepperyness kicked in. It didn't develop a lot of bite, or lose flavor, which is particularly noteable, because I am not particularly skilled at pacing my puffs, and usually I'll have wrecked the tobacco by that point, leaving no flavor or generally bitey nastiness for the remaining half to 3/4 of the bowl. It smoked entirely to ash, with me only having to relight once, and my carer not having to relight at all, which is also unusual. All in all, it was an extremely pleasurable smoke. As an additional side note, the shipping was ingenious, the tube held exactly one bowlful and dumped directly into my pipe and tamping gently made for the most perfect pack I've ever personally obtained.

My Background: Smoking off and on for about 6 years. Not very skilled smoker. My carer has been smoking for 33 years and is a moderately skilled smoker. He generally prefers non aromatic tobacco of various cuts, I generally prefer ribbon cuts of various sorts.

DaffodilsTigerlilies: It was a sample of a blend developed by a fellow redditor, /u/linearOne. I'm not sure whether you can get a sample still, but he posted the recipe above.
