[Review] Low Country - Waccamaw
By: VonSausage
---
Blender: Low Country (Smokingpipes.com in partnership with Cornel and Diehl)

Blend name: Waccamaw 

Contents: Bright leaf and Red Virginias, Perique, Izmir.

Cut: Broken Flake. Advertised as just "flake." I've read other reviews where it was an actual intact flake but mine was not.

Purchased: 2012 from SP

Pipes used: Peterson Killarney billiard, MM Missouri Pride bent with a Forever Stem Churchwarden stem, MM Legend straight, Peterson X220

Tin Moisture: A bit too moist to smoke but not sopping. I rubbed it out and within 30 minutes it was good to go.

Tin Aroma: When I first opened the tin the room was filled with an overwhelming smell of prunes, figs, raisins and an overall earthy note like dark soil. As it lay out to dry a bit I picked up gentle notes of black pepper and smoked meat. Over the week that I reviewed this the tin aroma shifted dramatically. Within a few days it was more of a milk chocolate and raspberry; the prune smell was completely gone. Now, it smells like instant chocolate milk mix. Kinda cool, actually. Never had a tobacco shift that much.

Taste: This is sold as a VaPer and it definitely contains Virginia and Perique, but the Izmir and Perique are front and center. They easily overpowered the Virginias in this blend. If you're a fan of spice, this blends for you. The taste leaned towards roasted peppers, black pepper and a sweetness I can't quite place... some kinda fruit like plums.

Room note: According to the wife it smelled like cigarettes. This is definitely an outside smoke for most people. Retrohales brought some mild sweetness but mostly hints of the oriental and Perique.

Verdict: Very interesting stuff. I'm glad I smoked it but I don't think I'll get another tin. I like Izmir and Perique, but together in these quantities was just unbalanced. I have about half a tin left. Im gonna try to mix it with some more Virginia to even out the spicy. 6/10
====================================
DaveInPhilly: I really dig this one. I prefer it to Embarcadero, but the two are very similar.

henchmanup: I'm going to agree with Dave.  This blend really works for me when I want something a little bit more flavorful.  Age does become it.

VonSausage: Most of the newer reviews seem to note that the blend is more balanced. Some of the older tins reviewed mention the imbalance I experienced. I'm tempted to order another tin to do a side by side. If the Virginias were more present I'd probably really dig this one.

antiwittgenstein: Oh man, as both a Virginia and Balkan man this might be right up my alley. Do they still sell this stuff?

Dubhan: I havenâ€™t had Waccamaw, but their Cooper is one of my favorites.

None: You might want to check out Mcclelland's Tudor Castle, if you want something similar.  

Also, there is the C&D Sunday Picnic which I have yet to sample, yet should be quite similar to those two.
