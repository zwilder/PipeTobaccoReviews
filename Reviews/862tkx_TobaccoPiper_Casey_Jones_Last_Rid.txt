Casey Jones Last Ride Pipe Tobacco Review
By: TobaccoPiper
---
Description: Casey Jones Last Ride is an aromatic pipe tobacco made up of black Cavendish, Burley, and Virginias. It is topped with a vanilla & cherry flavoring. 

Strength: Very Mild
​
Flavor: Mild to Medium 
​
Tin Note: Pleasant light vanilla aroma
 
Room Note: The room note is very pleasant. It is not heavy or perfume-like. 
​
Tasting Notes: This is a very low-strength, easy to enjoy blend. Unlike some cherry tobaccos, the hints of vanilla serve to keep the cherry in check. The flavor combinations are very nice, with mild cherry notes. It is fairly mellow and not too sweet. The cherry flavor seems to weaken slightly towards the end of the bowl, but the flavors remain consistent. The tobacco burns slow and evenly and is not too moist. I experienced no tongue-bite whatsoever. I did have to relight a few times, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The flavors are fairly straightforward and not too complex. 
 
 
Price: This is a inexpensive tobacco. As of this date of this review, pipesandcigars.com is selling a 1.5 ounce pouch for $5.49.  I would not consider this a "value" blend, as the quality of the tobacco is excellent.  
 
Overall Opinion: This is a good, consistent aromatic blend that is excellent for new pipe smokers. The lack of tongue bite combined with the constant flavor profile makes​ this a nice smoke to include in a regular rotation.

TobaccoPiper: Have you tried Last Ride? What do you think about it?

SupraMario: I think the majority of us do see this as a value tobacco that P&C carries and would give away. I might be inclined to try it if I got it for around 2.50 a pouch, but other than that, it's not been on my list at all.

I say this as a pretty big Aro snob.
