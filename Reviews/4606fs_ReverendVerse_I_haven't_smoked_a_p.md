I haven't smoked a pipe (or posted a review) since 2012... and I'm back into the game - what did I miss?

I used to be super active here for a number of years - the last review I posted being back in 2012. I had some health issues that came up and I decided to step away from my pipes (I still kept them though!) - back then some new players were making a name for themselves by branching out on their own with new interesting blends or previous unknowns were finally breaking out; G.L. Pease, Russ Ouellette, Just For Him with their amazing Middle-earth blends - and so on. Every week it seemed like there was some new amazing blends were coming out. Well, my health issues have since been resolved, and I'm back and ready to smoke some pipe tobacco! I was wanting to know what are some new amazing blends that have been making the rounds that I should try out in my pipes? 
Back in 2012, what I loved was Sillem's Black, Frog Morton on the Bayou, Shortcut to Mushrooms from Just for Him, Westminster by G.L. Pease
====================================
cgrd: Welcome back!

You can get Squadron Leader anytime you want these days. 

L.J. Peretti made a club blend for the sub called Upvote, they sell it on their website as No. 8 Slices.

Esoterica tobaccos are still hoarded.
--
ReverendVerse: I've had Squadron Leader before, it's an excellent blend. I'll have to give upvoted a whirl, thanks for the suggestion!
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: It is great. Super cool and easy smoker. I picked up some about a month ago and have blown through it. 
--
bonehed: They had a limited run special edition of Squadron Leader with Perique... quite tasty if you can find it...

Edit: Welcome back!
--
ReverendVerse: That actually sounds amazing. Hopefully I can find some.

====================================
PeskyPrussian: Russ Ouellette has been pretty prolific recently.  He has a blend that I love called Fire Storm which, as he admits, is just Anniversary Kake with an extra large dose of perique in it.  

C&D also released their Cellar series recently which has been very well received, at least from what I've seen.  I've yet to try any of those but apparently they're great.
--
====================================
None: Make sure you try Frog Morton Cellars. It's possibly even better than the original. If you like Frog Morton and Just For Him blends, try their Mellow Monk. It's delicious, too. 
--
ReverendVerse: I bought a tin of that last night. Looking forward to trying it!
--
====================================
simplechef: Well tell what what blends you already like, then we can go from there.
--
ReverendVerse: Sillem's Black, Frog Morton on the Bayou, Shortcut to Mushrooms from Just for Him, Westminster & Odyssey by G.L. Pease - I loved latakia and perqiue blends.
--
Carl_Schmitt: Welcome back! I'm pretty excited about the Standard Tobacco Company's reproductions of John Cotton's, War Horse, and Bengal Slices. Haven't tried them yet, as I have a phobia of smoking immature tobacco. I do have my doubts, as they are made by Lane, a company known more for quantity than quality, but I'll crack them open and see in a few months and see.
--
ReverendVerse: I just saw that P&C has a War Horse remake as well. It sounds good and right up my alley - I'll have to check out Standard Tobacco Company's version of it though. 
--
Carl_Schmitt: They're one and the same.
--
simplechef: Have you tried any of the Seattle Pipe club blends? I know that they are newer and have become pretty popular. The plum pudding seems to be the best one. I personally haven't tried them yet though they are on my list.
--
ReverendVerse: No, I haven't tried them, or even heard of them, but I'll check them out. Is the Plum Pudding an aromatic? Looking at them now, the Potlatch sounds pretty damn good. 
--
simplechef: No sir, none of their blends are aros
--
ReverendVerse: Just bought a tin! I hope I can get back into writing reviews, so I might do one of this. 
--
None: Seconding this - Plum Pudding for English, Deception Pass makes me really happy for a Va/Per.  I am super impressed with everything SPC is doing.

====================================
chewsyourownadv: As GL Pease goes, Navigator (Kentucky-Virginia + a buncha rum) and Sextant (latakia blend with rum) were both released near the end of 2012. If you cut off before that, give 'em a try. 

Since 2012, there's been Sextant, a Virginia/Perique blend with a dash of Kentucky and Rum. Not *great*, but pretty good.

Then there's Gaslight, which is a very good latakia plug. It's good out of the tin, and Pease claims to have blended it to be very cellar-friendly.

Then there's The Virginia Cream, which is a Virginia + a little perique and dark-fired something, with a mild vanilla topping. I didn't like it a lot out of the tin, though it wasn't bad. It definitely needed more time in the tin to let everything mix.
