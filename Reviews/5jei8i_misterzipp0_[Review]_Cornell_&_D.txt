Exhausted Rooster 

Stumbled upon a five and a half year old tin of this and decided to pop it open to celebrate a positive life event.  Those have been few and far between these last few months so it was a welcomed rush to let my brain feel happy again. Hopefully I'm not putting too much stock in this blend as a celebratory smoke.

I put that tin right up to my nose and popped it open and was greeted with a large whoosh as the tin was already bulging.  The scent that came through was a large citrus rush that I couldn't quite place.  For any homebrewers out there it was like the scent of a freshly opened bag of Citra or Chinook hops, tons of citrus with a dank background note.  Maybe it's blood oranges? Cura√ßao? Perhaps this blend is topped with an orange liquor?  It smells delicious and I hope the taste echoes.

I pick out one and a half flakes and give them a chunky cube cut and leave them to dry out for about 20 minutes before I gravity feed them into a medium sized author.

Cold draw: some Virginia but that intense citrus spice is dominant. The smell is driving me nuts bc it's so close to so many different things. It might be hibiscus tea? Argh... Just smoke it already, Zipp0!

First light: All Virginia! Slightly sweet but very intense hay greets the first few draws. This is not a light Virginia by any stretch.  I'm not having to search for notes as they are practically rushing through the pipe to me.  I think it still needed more drying time bc I'm having to relight quite a bit.  While silently apologizing to my tongue I set that bad boy on fire and prayed I wouldn't regret it later. Even pushing this thing harshly it gives a great cigar taste with a bit of chocolate.

1/4:  now that I have it lit and have got a good cadence going we are starting to see some of the darker flavors emerge:  boozy fruitcake, that maple like sweetness from the dark fired, an almost umami taste like poutine or scratch gravy from roast beef keeps coming in.  I think another blend of theirs, Oriental Silk has the same note.  The retrohale lets you enjoy that punch of spice from the perique but the taste has to be more of the chocolate/fruit variety because it's just heat.  No cinnamon or pepper, just a wasabi like heat that comes through at just the right amount.  

Im starting to see more of the dark fired emerge.  It and that citrus note are playing king of the mountain but I'm calling the rumble early and declaring DF King.

Halfway:  I run a pipe cleaner all the way through to create an air pocket and give it an aggressive tamp.  The flavor is still back and forth between citrus and dark fired so it appears that I spoke too soon. The citrus has changed into some bright bursts of lemon and the nicotine is starting to creep up on me. I haven't eaten anything so I don't think it's too heavy but we shall see.

This is starting to remind me of Sixpence but with more dark fired and maybe more perique.  Initially I though the blend was leaning towards McClelland's 2035 but that was fleeting.

The end of the bowl has me a bit woozy and I'm going to stumble to the microwave to reheat my coffee and see how it plays.  I am drinking a cheap Sumatran blend that is pretty one note (if not a little foody tasting) but the earthiness of it actually lets the bright citrus and the strong Virginia flavors reemerge.

Overall this is a solid smoke that folks wishing to explore more stout VaPer's should  put on their TAD list.  Don't be put off by the dark fired as it's still condimental and has its place in this blend.

Colors tasted/smelled are burnt umber, dark orange, mossy green, and a bit of red.

I still have a sneaking suspicion this blend is topped but it could be the that the perique is of a high quality and had an influence in the tin over the last five years.

Like most Virginias the only fault I have is that unless the pack is absolutely perfect or you hit that magical sweet spot the smoke is just a bit thin. I smoked lots of cigars in my younger days and I prefer a lot of smoke.

Poopsock_Piper: I have a tin I bought a couple of months ago that isn't near that dark, not sure how I feel about it, it's good however I've only had a couple of bowls. It sure does knock me on my ass by the end of a bowl. Thanks for the review.

====================================
forwormsbravepercy: Are you a synaesthete?
--
misterzipp0: Not in the 'all 5s are red sense' but I have a strong sense of taste/smell and I reference a color when I smell something before I can translate it into a "flavor".  This is especially true when it comes to perfumes.
--
====================================
-godofwine-: It's one of my faves... I have about 6 tins cellared with the oldest being around 5yrs.
--
====================================
mtn_mojo: Love the taste of the colors. I know what you mean. I don't have total synesthesia, but some flavors just taste a certain color! I get some shapes as well. A very welcome addition to a really well-written review!
--
misterzipp0: Thanks!  The shapes is interesting, haven't heard that before, can you elaborate on it a bit?

I was going over the definition of everything and reading the Wikipedia entry of it to my wife and she just looked at me and said that is totally you. When I was trying to describe how I work math problems in my head and can physically and spatially  manipulate the numbers she just gave me this crazy look.
--
mtn_mojo: Hmm, kind of hard to describe, but for instance something with a savory, umami taste, like beef gravy or something, I would describe as round; something citrus-y or lemon-y as bright, sharp, angular. Flavors can be bottom-heavy, hollow, spherical, edged, narrow, wide...I am not sure I can put it quite into words that make sense, but basically a taste or small can create an abstract, spatial image in my head, complete with an idea of shape, density, and color that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the actual color or shape of what I'm eating. It can kind of work that way with sound too, a lot of the descriptive words wind up being the same, though I experience them differently.
--
misterzipp0: That sounds amazing!  I certainly enjoy my colors and I imagine the shape aspect puts a whole new dimension (yes, pun) on the visual component enjoyed while smoking.
--
mtn_mojo: Your unique way of solving math problems sounds amazing too! Man, the human brain is truly a wondrous thing, isn't it?
--
====================================
SupraMario: Now you need to pick up a non-aged tin and see how it compares.
--
misterzipp0: ...The only drawback to buying aged tins.
--
SupraMario: Yup lol, I have a good bit of aged stuff...just need to bite the bullet and buy new stuff to compare it to.
--
====================================
None: I just got some GL Pease Sextant, yea it has a really nice rum note, but I just can't dig this shit. It's just that tobacco seems like such shitty quality compared to Gawith. It seems so cheap in comparison, even the topping, the latakia , the consistency, everything. Whats up with this? Why does everyone smoke this shit, all this C&D & GLP? I don't get it. I want to like it, but the quality is just so poor compared to SG/GH. Sextant because seems like Edward G Robinson on steroids, with a stronger topping, more latakia, lil better quality yea. But I just gon't get why there is such an ocean size gap in quality between cd/glp & Gawith?!
--
misterzipp0: I'm thinking it has to do with age.  Most C+D/GLP is great once it settles a bit but the hard part is waiting. Gawith ages their stuff a bit as does McClelland so it's much smoother.  C+D is a smaller op so they aren't able to age it before market.

If you get a chance try going to a B+M and picking up some tins with a few years on them and you'll see a huge difference.
--
None: I really, really, really don't think it has anything to do with age. The tobacco quality is nowhere near Gawith. I believe the difference is that the tobacco is way way better quality to begin with, and Gawith's just actually know what their doing and use quality processing as well as flavorings. Cornell & Diehl has hundreds of blends, I really don't see them as a small operation. Was this a joke? You know how small of an operation Samuel Gawith & Gawith Hoggarth are right? 
--
misterzipp0: Perhaps small operation was the wrong wording in that I meant they seem to make their tobacco in smaller batches which is why SP will have them in stock almost always but others will not.

I'm suspicious that a lot of their blends are the same with one ingredient added or removed much like many small breweries do to make it seem as if they are larger.

There are pics and videos of their warehouse out there, they're not big by any means.

SG and Gawith are using VAs from different continents so perhaps you prefer that style to young American Vas?

I'm not defending anyone btw just trying to figure out why C+D is 50/50 for me as well.
--
None: Yea I agree about the rebranding. I think it's more than VAs. Everything seems like a different quality level, including the toppings. I don't really see this tobacco as much better than any of the sutliff brands and only slightly above drug store quality.
