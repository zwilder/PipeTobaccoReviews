Black Irish X Review
By: Bragisson
---
Okay lads, if any of you have followed my posts, I have a thing for high nicotine blends. Going through the likes of Kentucky Dark Fired, Brown Bogie, and Royal Yacht, I am still looking for something that will knock me back into a chair, whiskey cup dangling dangerously from my hand. 
I’ve been sitting on some ropes for about two months at this point. Thought I’d break into G+H’s Black Irish X. 
To start, I must admit that I tried to chew the stuff. Not only did I almost puke, but my partner harassed me to brush my teeth quickly after realizing what I was up to. 
Teeth clean, and sparkling with minty freshness, i made my way onto the Internet to look up the best way of cutting rope. SmokingPipes has a great tutorial. 
Slicing the rope into thin coins with my very own elk handled Bowie knife, I found myself with what could be about $2 in quarters (for you European types, that would be about €1.72) 
These fine cut coins I had just made reminded me of the smoked sausage I had just downed not an hour beforehand, smell, and size. 
Next came the rub to produce a shag, or flake (depending on how many rings I have on at the time) Taking the coins, I started rolling them in between my two hands, allowing my rings to break up the harder packed pieces. About five minutes later, I had some fair pieces. 
I must admit I had an itch under my eye, and upon relieving the irrefutable temptation to rub, I found my eye in a painful state. Having stopped at a local coffee shop, I made my way in, half blind, eyes redder than a freshmen in college at his first party, and of course, smelling like BBQ. A quick trip to the lavatory found my eye some comfort, and I could get back to the tobacco. 
Happily, this painful step back gave the tobacco time to dry out a nice bit (rope is considerably wet, thus fresh oils in the eye can be considered a real concern to those who enjoy seeing things correctly in front of them)
Grinding down the tobacco a tad bit more, and I was ready to load my Peterson (see butterfly, and “it’s a bit smaller than I thought”(that’s what she said) post in my user history for full disclosure on the beautiful pipe from Dublin.)
Loading the pipe was the easy part, but next came finding the matches which always disappear at the least appropriate times. 
Upon finding a lighter, some 7 minutes later, I began with a much needed smoke. 
As I stated above, I like HH Kentucky Dark Fired, for its bbq and nicotine hit. I think I found its fighting drunk cousin (no offense to my fellow Irishmen) This brought back memories of a family cookout, smell, taste, and the fact my brother had hit me hard in the temple with a rouge frisbee. I was, for a better word, drunk on lady nicotine. 
Needing many relights, for the soul reason I was slowly enjoying myself, halfway through the bowl, I was already planning on ordering more. The BBQ slowly turned into a matured charred meat, all the while luring the smoker back into a comfortable nicotine embrace. A knockout blend through and through, the tobacco turning into a fine white ash leaving one with memories of summer nights spent with family, or craving more space in their van to fit a four piece grill. 5/5 would reorder again. 

====================================
wyrmis: Possibly the most "nicotine drunk" I have ever been came from this blend. I have smoked quite a bit of Happy Bogie, and I knew the stoving process reduced the nicotine of Black Irish XX and was cocky about it so I got some coins going (I use a pair of scissors instead of a knife, but the principle is the same) and loaded a good number of them up into a large Missouri Meerschaum Freehand and set myself up on my balcony and began puffing (and relighting, because this stuff requires more relighting than any blend I know). Somewhere around the halfway mark, I turned my head a little too fast to grab my cup of tea and it was like watching time slow down and all the colors danced just a little. Just because it doesn't hit as hard as Happy Bogie is no excuse for a man to do what I did...unless you are into that sort of thing, and if you are, I won't judge. Great smoke. Very flavorful.

FullFrontalNoodly: That all sounds so familiar...  You'll definitely need to pick up some of the Brown Irish rope while you're at it.  Try blending the Brown and Black in the same bowl, I find the two of them play very well together.

Bragisson: Smoking Brown Irish right now actually, but this time, I washed my hands before touching my face like a good scientist would after handling dangerous blends.

antiwittgenstein: Hilarious review. Did you want this considered for the contest?

This was very similar to my experience, from the bbq and meat flavors to the green gills to the feeling of that long lingering nic high.

FullFrontalNoodly: Is the contest still going on?  I thought the deadline passed a while ago.

====================================
givemeyours0ul: Charred beef fat is what I get from this blend. I'll stick with brown bogie.

====================================
TKColo: For chewing, use the bogie. wrap a 1/2" chunk in some minty gum, chew spit repeat. The bogie is a much better flavor than the Irish X. The sugary gum mellows it out. Way more vitamin N than chewing tobacco.
