Tobacco Review: McClelland Contest Blend
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 99

**Blend Name:** McClelland Contest Blend
 
**Description on Tin:** McClelland has been asked to provide this blend several times over the years for the slow-smoking contest held by pipe clubs. In every instance, contestants have commented on the good taste, pleasant light-up and easy draw. Contest Blend is a winning blend, even for those who didn't come in first (or is it last?). Why wait for a contest to enjoy this exceptional pipe tobacco blend of matured and stoved Virginias with a very little touch of Latakia. It was developed for the long-distance pipe smoker, but is enjoyable even in a sprint.

**Leaf:** Variegated dark brown to black ribbon. 
 
**Tin Aroma:** McKetchup. Normally I think it smells like Worcestershire sauce, but this is straight up Whataburger Ketchup. 

**Age when smoked:** Fresh off the truck but the tin is dated 2012.

**Taste:** Earthy, petrichor. Light smoke. Subtle citrus and vinegar. Worcestershire sauce. Essence of McKetchup. Tastes like the tin note. Faint sweetness tying it all together. Distinct saltiness with umami flavors still, soy sauce maybe, creamy mushrooms. Suddenly the door is kicked down and the flavor bowls in, high sweet yellow-lemon, intensified salt and vinegar, complex umami heavy sauce, I would swear there is Turkish here, or the Latakia is something special. It adds a funk and a sort of rose petal taste and aroma to the proceeding. A woodsy smokiness comes and goes. This brings a bit of leather and earth, similar to an aged cigar. Cream again. Stays woodsy-smoky through the end.

Note: about half of my smokes donâ€™t turn Latakia dominate, but stay bright-lemon-vinegar-McKetchup all the way through. The other half are like this. Most likely is pipe and weather condition dependent.

**Nicotine:** A light 4, not heavy, but took me aback for a Virginia dominate blend.

1.	Hot air â€“ 1 Q, Larryâ€™s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something â€“ Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isnâ€™t so bad anymore â€“ Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks â€“ Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer â€“ Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Whereâ€™d my legs go â€“ Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing â€“ Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** I would have been laughed right out of the contest. The baccy is dry enough to smoke straight from the tin, a rare feat from McClelland in my experience. But this stuff expands like a pyroclastic flow. No matter how densely I tried to pack this stuff, it seemed to always be too light of a pack, so I would have to tamp aggressively, and resort to at least 3 relights every bowl after an already multi-light start.
 
**Side Stream:** Toasty, woodsy, sometimes like old roses.

**Thoughts:** When the 5100 scare happened, I bought about a dozen lesser known and loved McClelland tins to review over the next year or two, to give alternatives to 5100 or other endangered blends. But as we all found out the last day or so, that means the whole catalogue. 
This blend is a strange duck, but not a unique one. It reminds me of another one of my favorite â€“ and also now discontinued â€“ blends, Sutliff Court of St. James, which is VaPer with a bit of Latakia. Virginia is dominate in this blend, but sometimes, like tonightâ€™s smoke, the Latakia takes over, and it transitions into a very mild, no nonsense English, along the lines of the Frog Morton concept. Other times it stays in VA territory, and reminds me of Blackwoods light. It never hits the same highs or bass notes, but plugs along in the middle range with a deep and satisfying lemon-vinegar business, with that essence of McClelland peppering it. If you are fan of the style and you see one around, grab a tin or two while you still can. 
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Sutliff Court of St. James, Blackwoods, Dark Star, Aged 5100 
 
**Summary:** Lemon-Vinegar McKetchup blend with an elegant dose of Latakia

**My Background** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
SupraMario: Love this stuff tbh, it's almost all gone now though, it's basically 5100 with some lat. It's great. Sucks that it's all gone now.

Cycleoflife: ðŸ˜­ I'm seriously crying inside about this. My favorite blender, gone. No one I know IRL has a clue. If I wasn't trying to buy a house right now I'd be acquiring a veritable ocean of McClelland right now. I'm not sure if this limitation is a blessing or a curse. All I know is that the pipeworld has lost a champion and will never be the same.

SupraMario: Same, mccelland was a tobacco company that fit my palet to perfection. Now that they are going away and it doesn't look like they will be selling the brand, it's a terrible blow to the pipe world. Can't believe they are gone.

pipegrouch: Hey awesome review! To clarify the side streamâ€”is that when you let air come in to mix with the air coming in from the pipe? 
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate! Sidestream is the aroma of the smoke as I exhale. I used to have this as 'Room note' but since I don't smoke inside any longer, that wasn't a good descriptor.
