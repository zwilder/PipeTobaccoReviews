Half and Half: A First Review, or a Cautionary Tale
By: SickWillie
---
Many years ago when I was younger I tried to pick up smoking a pipe, and like many people was recommended an aromatic tobacco that burnt the heck out of my tongue. I gave it up, but always thought there had to be something I was missing.

Well, fast forward almost a decade I found what I was missing - this fine subreddit and the wealth of knowledge here. I picked up a pipe, and a few tobaccos recommended from the sidebar. Then, shortly I ordered a few more tobaccos. And again, still more. Turns out, I have extraordinary luck and loved everything I had ordered.

This led me to worry that I have no “taste” in tobacco, that I couldn’t say that I prefer X in a blend, or Y family of tobaccos. Well, the other night I found the tobacco that proved I actually do have some taste in tobacco, the tobacco that prompted me to attempt writing a review: Half and Half.

**Description from P&C:** Long called Burley and Bright, Half and Half has proven to be well liked by pipe smoking masses. This tobacco delivers a cool burning, flavorful smoke made of fine quality domestic Burley and bright, sweet, Virginias with a modest, pleasant top note. A cargo of contentment in each bowl.

**Pouch aroma:** Well, my first sign that something was about to go horribly wrong was the awful smell on opening this. Imagine the smell of a pack of cheap off brand cigarettes left forgotten on a hot dashboard for a summer - then mix in the smell of generic cough syrup. Yuck. Well, it can’t taste as bad as it smells - right?

**Pack and light:** Seemed a little moist, so I left it to dry for a bit before packing. Came back after about a half hour. Still moist? Oh well. Packed easily, the leaf had a nice uniform appearance. Lit easily enough. Smoked out of an unfinished Savinelli bent billiard, lit with matches.

**The smoke:** First impression of the smoke was all that horrible sweet generic cough syrup with a hint of burley. Yuck. Let it go out, tamped it down, lit it up again. A bit better, the awful taste became more of a background noise to pretty mild tobacco. Smoked a little hot, so I slowed down for the rest of the smoke.

Second half of the bowl was dominated by a battle for what I was tasting -sometimes burley, sometimes sweet cough syrup, sometimes something else I couldn’t place. I hated it but kept going, since that mystery flavor next to the tobacco wasn’t awful.

Near the end I realized I was only smoking to get through this horrible experience and gave up. The tobacco left in my pipe was sticky, gross smelling, and kinda a pain to clean out. The smell of my smoking clothes was the same smell of clothes after being around someone chain smoking cheap cigarettes. My beard reeked of both the chemical smell and cigarette smell. My dog wouldn’t even come near me.

**Final thoughts:** For the price, Prince Albert or Carter Hall would have been a MUCH better decision. Alternatively, you could go take a dose of some cough syrup you found in the back of your medicine cabinet that looks about 6 years old and light up a cigarette you found rolling around the floorboards of your buddies POS Chevy for the same experience.

0/5, would absolutely not recommend. I want to toss it in the trash, ~~but if someone out there enjoys this stuff shoot me a message and I might be able to send it out to you.~~

Those of you that enjoy Half and Half: Did I miss something? What do you taste when you smoke it?

**Tobaccos I’ve tried and enjoyed:** Prince Albert, Carter Hall, Dunhill 965, Dunhill Nightcap, Peterson Irish Oak, Peterson Sherlock Holmes, Frog Morton, Frog Morton Cellar, Country Squire Cornishman, Country Squire Baker Street, Country Squire Figgy Pudding.

**Current favorite:** Country Squire Baker Street. Holy cow that stuff is good.


**EDIT: Taste is totally subjective, so if you want to try some of this before buying a whole pouch of it from somewhere shoot me a message... I’m gonna split whats left of the pouch into “sample bags” to send out if anyone is interested.**
====================================
coldsolderjoint: I didn't think it was super horrible. I actually have a big can of it (along with a whole bunch of other prizes) up for a charity raffle on the pipes by numbers group on Facebook. 
--
SickWillie: Hm, seems I’m in the minority - maybe the online reviews were accurate? I think I should add a disclaimer to my review. 

Also, maybe it tastes better with Dr Pepper?

====================================
givemeyours0ul: Wow! I've only had one bowl of half and half so far on my OTC journey. I thought it was fine. SWR on the other hand I don't like, partly because I can't keep that fish food burning.
--
vertdeferk: I like SWR and find the success to keeping it burning is all in the tamping. For me, it seems to like a smaller bowl as well. 
--
SickWillie: Fish food?! Haha, that’s disgusting. I think I’m going to pass on trying SWR for now - limit myself to one bad experience per month or something. I mean, taste is totally subjective, haha, and for something thats been around forever SOMEONE has to like it, right?

Prince Albert is a solid OTC blend in my opinion. Good flavor, satisfying smoke, pleasant aftertaste/aroma. It’s my go to “I wanna smoke but don’t wanna think too much about it” tobacco. Good for when you’re occupied doing something else.
--
givemeyours0ul: I'm using fish food to refer to the cut. It doesn't smell like fish food.
--
zero-hunter: It does, however, taste to me like burning banana peels. 
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I think the cut is more like granola than fish food.
--
givemeyours0ul: You're right! 
--
SickWillie: Oh, well that makes a lot more sense - I was worried there for a second...

====================================
brainskan13: I don't recall disliking Half & Half as much as you did, but I did try a pouch of it years ago. I think I smoked 2 bowls and put the rest in a jar. I finally tossed it out after it had been sitting in that jar for several years. I don't like Burley that is aged that long, even when it's high quality.

As always, to each their own. It still sells and has its fans. I prefer Carter Hall or Prince Albert when I want some OTC Burley.
--
SickWillie: Ha, I really disliked it - I really tried to find some quality reviews before throwing a pouch in my latest P&C order. Most people that rated it highly put stuff along the lines of _“Just like my old grandad smoked on his porch! Great stuff. -5 stars”._ I’m really curious as to what people get out of it - but it very well could be an individual thing, just not my thing.
--
brainskan13: Oh, don't get me wrong. I did not enjoy my 2 bowls of Half & Half. I agree with your tasting notes, that it had a bit of a medicinal sweetness that was a turn off for me too. I wasn't thrilled with the underlying tobaccos either.

Usually, I would have still smoked through the pouch eventually if I had just found it mostly unoffensive or bland. I would have given it away too, but it just didn't even seem worth bothering to do that. I throw very few tobaccos in the trash. That one ended up there.
--
SickWillie: Yeah if it was unoffensive or bland I’d keep it around. If nobody contacts me to claim whats left shortly I’ll chuck the bag. Probably not even worth the postage!
--
====================================
kingjames488: sounds kinda like my initial impression of carter hall, hay and something I can now describe as cough syrup(or maybe cheep alcohol).
--
SickWillie: Huh, I didn’t get much from my pouch of Carter Hall - I think it’s probably the most neutral thing I’ve smoked. CH reminds me of old Backwoods cigars, after they’ve become a little stale. 

Taste buds are weird. 
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I didn't get cough syrup from CH, but I did get cheap alcohol and artificial sweetener.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Hilarious review mate. I haven't ventured this far yet. Thank you for your sacrifice.
--
SickWillie: Ha! Thank you. I’ve always enjoyed reading the reviews on here - probably need to be a bit more impartial if I try one again. 

Thanks for the inspiration with your dastardly contest the other month! It made me start jotting down notes and impressions while I smoke.
--
====================================
Zenith251: I'm with ya bud, it's putrid. Compared to most standard Lane, Stokkebye, etc. bulk tobaccos, Half and Half is like smoking something that came from a chemical waste dump. 
--
SickWillie: Phew! Was thinking I was alone there for a minute. 

On the plus side, it was cheap and it never hurts (too bad) to try something new.
--
Zenith251: It's not just a stereotype that tobacco that comes pre-packed in a pouch or box is low quality. Doesn't apply to cigarette tobacco.

Even the Sutliff gold colored pouches suck compared to their actual bulk tobaccos.

Edit: Expected to be downvoted to hell by those that think boxed tobacco is the bee's knees.
--
SickWillie: I totally agree - however, sometimes that low quality tobacco taste satisfies in a nice quiet way. I really enjoy Prince Albert, and if I can’t decide what I want to smoke that’s what ends up in my pipe. Quiet, mild, simple. 
--
Zenith251: I have a tobacco like that as well: GL Pease Piccadilly. I always keep some around for exactly that reason.

Heliumiami: I've branched out in my ~~vices~~ indulgences, from Scotch, to Bourbon, to spirits in general, and now here.  I can attest to the same thing with booze - sometimes you need to drink the swill in order to appreciate the finer ones!  
--
SickWillie: Hey theres always room for another ~~bad habit~~ hobby! 

> sometimes you need to drink the swill in order to appreciate the finer ones! 


So true - haha. I think that it is true of a lot of things in life. It is good to have bad experiences occasionally - helps you learn to deal with them and makes the good experiences better. This stuff was definitely swill.

coffeeshopslut: If you're in the states and want some 1q to try, let me know
--
SickWillie: Thanks! I might take you up on that... not sure how I feel about aromatics yet. 

Appreciate the offer!!
