Old Ones: Keeping you warm on a cold autumn day

So it was that /u/chewsyourownadv once again hooked me up with a great set of samples.  Today, I went ahead and compared the new C&D Old Ones.

Now, to be transparent, I'm not generally a fan of C&D.  I like dark, sweet virginias and va/pers, and I like orientals, so I'm definitely in the McClelland camp as my favorite tobacco company.  I think C&D is at the opposite end of the spectrum flavor-wise, so I wasn't expecting too much.

I loaded four MM cobs, all filtered pipes, with about 1/2 bowl each of Innsmouth, Mad Fiddler, Dreams of Kadath and Miskatonic.  I lit them round-robin and smoked them, puffing in pairs to compare them all to each other.  They have similar components in different quantities.

* Innsmouth: Virginia, Katerini, Perique and Black Cavendish

* Mad Fiddler: Virginia, Kasturi, Perique and Black Cavendish

* Miskatonic: Katerini, Virginia, Perique and Black Cavendish

* Kadath: Dark Fired Kentucky, Katerini, Perique, Virginia, Burley and Black Cavendish

The Innsmouth is my least favorite of the bunch.  It's very C&D -- dry (as in wine), fresh hay, Virginia forward but not the kind of Virginia I like.  The perique is spicy pepper, but there's only a little and is in the background.  When the Katerini makes itself known, it's very nice olive oil and floral, but it's very light in the oriental department.  I'd enjoy this with more Katerini, which we'll get to in a minute.

The Fiddler is interesting because of the Kasturi, which gives it an herbal sweetness that I enjoyed.  Again, the Perique is peppery, but lightly used.  Unfortunately for me, the Kasturi kind of disappeared after the first couple of minutes, and the flavor profile became similar to Innsmouth.  It's definitely much better when smoked slowly, so give this one time and it's decently enjoyable.

Miskatonic was, I think, my favorite of the group.  It's heavier on both the Perique and the Katerini, so the floral sweetness and peppery spice stick around puff after puff.  The Virginia is almost an afterthought, which worked well for me from C&D.  I might actually get some of this to age a bit and see how it does in a year or two.

Dreams of Kadath was also pretty good.  I'm not a huge burley fan, but the burley really rounded out the blend and the dark fired added a nice flavor overall.  I think the Katerini component was similar to Miskatonic -- more of it than the other two, which made the blend flavorful and sweeter.  This was the most complex of the blends, likely because of all the different components.  

All in all, it kept me warm on this cold and somewhat rainy day in the Northeast.

chewsyourownadv: You're right in the other comment, we're mostly on the same page here. I'm thinking even if one doesn't like these blends a lot, Mad Fiddler makes a good showcase out of an uncommon component, and both Miskatonic and Kadath, while less of a showcase for Katerini, are the best examples I've seen of its usage.

levins0: I dare say miskatonic reminded me of drama reserve, which is one of my favorite blends. It surprised me, coming from C&D, how well the katerini showcased.

SwampGentleman: Thanks for the awesome write up! I was actually thinking of getting some kasturi from leafonly before this line came out and trying it straight. Boy am I tempted.

chewsyourownadv: It's weird stuff. Put Awakened Elder on your radar too, if you like latakia blends. [Here's my review.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7cgxpr/cd_awakened_elder_a_review/)

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the thorough exploration of this line. That floral element, is it akin to lakeland poison, or more what you get from Latakia and certain orientals?

levins0: Not Lakeland at all. It's primarily the katerini, that olive oil floral oriental element. Really nice.
