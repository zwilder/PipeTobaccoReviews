Review # 95 & 96

**Blend Name:** Sutliff Christmas Spice versus Country Squire Figgy Pudding
 
**Description on Website:** 

*Christmas Spice*

Sutliff's Christmas Spice is a rich aromatic blend of vanilla, caramel, and cinnamon notes over a base of Virgina, Burley, and black Cavendish leaf.

*Figgy Pudding*

This full-bodied aromatic will please those with a sweet tooth, as well as those non-aromatic smokers that enjoy an occasional treat.  Subtly flavored black cavendish pairs with a variety of Virginia and Burley tobaccos to create this one-of-a-kind Christmas smoke!

**Leaf:** 

*Christmas Spice*

Broad ribbon black cav mixed with brown ribbon. Moist but not goupy.
 
*Figgy Pudding*

Similar looking but finer ribbon. Maybe a tad drier to the touch.

**Tin Aroma:** 

*Christmas Spice*

Vanilla-raisin custard

*Figgy Pudding*

Roughly identical.

**Age when smoked:** Both factory fresh.

**Taste:** 

*Christmas Spice*

Sometimes it is very flat. Like plain cavendish. But if you get lucky…

Sweet. Sugary sweet. Creamy vanilla. Er Vanilla cream. Some discernable cinnamon. Eggnoggy. A bit of rum, spiced rum I meant. Reminds me of Molto Dolce and Barbados Plantation mixed together. That is not a bad thing, I like both of those blends. I think this might actually be a bit better than each, less cloying and less goopy to the touch too. Very eggnog through the halfway to 2/3rds mark, then the cream fades away, but the spice remains. It sweetens up here too, but allows a tiny bit of egads – actual tobacco flavor. Just a bit of virginia sourness that peaks through, that is a fun compliment to the snickerdoodle flavors. At the end, it loses its flavor.

*Figgy Pudding* 

Sometimes it is also very flat. Kind of like Borkum Riff, but with less tongue bite. But if you get lucky…

Sweet. Virginia and burley flavors, mild but present. Raisins. Vanilla. Spicy. Like the baking spices you might expect, but also spicy in a peppery way. Not like perique, just the natural spice you often get with Virginia leaf. Cocoa, maybe white chocolate. Fruity puffs here and there. My brain wants to say cranberry. A bit of raisin still but also some citrus. Have you ever had the Rittersport Chocolate with orange slices in it? Something like that. When it hits its stride it settles down into Vanilla, the spiciness, and a sugary sweetness. The flavor doesn’t let up until you hit ash.

**Nicotine:** Both 1-2 territory.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** Very similar, they only need a few minutes of drying. The light is difficult, but once you have it going properly relights are infrequent or entirely unnecessary. Smoke slowly and use the breath method for best results. Figgy Pudding can leave you with a small tongue bite.
 
**Side Stream:** Glorious. Christmas Spice has a vanilla-eggnog-baking spice smell to it. Kind of like fresh baked snickerdoodles. Figgy Pudding is more vanilla-cocoa. Either one will make you friends.

**Thoughts:** First, apologies for not having this out before the holidays, but you know how those can go. But as the Elves say, now it is time to start preparing for next Christmas!

I bought the Christmas Spice after the rave review from /u/AdamantFinn – and also because I really, really enjoyed the [Sutliff Pumpkin Spice](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/74rhvp/tobacco_review_sutliff_pumpkin_spice/). However after my first smoke of the spice it was flat, really non-eventful, something close to 1-Q on a bad day. I mentioned this on a thread and he offered to send me Figgy Pudding, which allowed for this review – thanks again brother. I was immediately impressed with the Figgy Pudding, big, bold flavors like I was hoping for. Because I am persistent I gave the Christmas Spice another try – and it tasted like above, so, good. Very good. After a few good smokes of the Figgy Pudding I had at least one that was also meh and flat. So this is something interesting I learned, that even very good aromatics, for hard to predict reasons, whether a hot light, drying time, ambient conditions, or the smoker’s nervous system, can be uneventful. It makes me want to dig through my tobacco library to see if I can get better performance out of some aros I have slighted in the past. 

So, which one should you buy? Both of course. Which one is better? Well that is tricky. I have had a better experience with Christmas Spice – when you have it right, it is everything you thought an aromatic should be able to taste like, full, intense, present flavors – but when you have it wrong, which is very easy to do, well it is makes Prince Albert seem like a flavor bomb. Figgy Pudding can also be amazing, but I haven’t had the absolute transcendent experience I did with Christmas Spice, or at least, not yet. But when it is having an off bowl, it is still good, with the Vanilla, Spice, and inherently quality tobacco making things interesting. So the difference between the two is like having a slugger who strikes out a lot versus have a more consistent hitter who might not knock out of the park, but will get have quality base hits.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Each other? Molto Dolce and Barbados Plantation, Captain Black Royal, H&H Eggnog.
 
**Summary:** 

*Christmas Spice* - Creamy-vanilla eggnog

*Figgy Pudding* - Complex Spicy Vanilla 

**My Background** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**++ for each. These are difficult to rate, each sliding between meh and outstanding depending on the bowl.

Rating system (interpreted through modern era Christmas songs ):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Caroling, Caroling)

(++++) Great (Silver Bells)

(+++) Very good (All I Want for Christmas is You)

(++) Good (Christmas Wrapping)

(+) I think like it (The Man with the Bag)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (The Night Before Christmas Song)

(-) I think I dislike this (Merry Christmas Baby)

(--)This is not for me (Little Jack Frost Get Lost)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Christmas Auld Lang Syne – New Years Eve has one song and you don’t get to have it Christmas.)

(----)This is suffering (Hallalujah, Christmas Rendition. The original Lenoard Cohen song was, well while spiritual, not religious per se. It makes as much sense as turning a Lords of Acid song into a carol)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Santa Baby 2. Makes the original seem classy.)

harveybill: Very thorough, I always enjoy these from you

SupraMario: I love me some egg nog...do they always have Xmas spice on order?

Great review man!
--
antiwittgenstein: It is still in stock at SP as of this afternoon, when I lifted the description. I am fairly certain it was just released this holiday season, so I am not sure if it will be around indefinitely or only until the remaining baccy is sold up.
--
SupraMario: Ahh, well going to have to grab some cause egg nog is the only reason I don't completely hate the winter months
--
====================================
freepancakesforall: Great stuff! I personally went with Christmas Spice this year with no regrets. Spot on review. 
--
antiwittgenstein: This is my first foray into the world of Holiday blends. I have the 3 C&D blends in my cellar (3 Kings, Golden Days, Corn cob) - have you had these, or others? How does Christmas Spice rank with them?
--
freepancakesforall: I’ve only had Corn Cob Pipe. Love that too but they’re pretty different. I actually reviewed it here. I’ll look when I’m not on mobile.    

I’d rank CCP and Christmas Spice pretty evenly. Both deliver what they promise. The only slight mark against CCP is that after a while the marshmallow note can become a bit too chemical. But the first half of the bowl is smoking a cup of hot chocolate. If the chemical taste doesn’t show up then the second half is a Burley dominant aromatic.     

Bonus points to CCP for the cube cut. That blend lights like a dream. Gravity fill, tamp, and one Light.

====================================
mgvsquared: Great reviews. I love Figgy, but I'm also a Squire patron and a friend of Jon David, so that probably colors my opinion a fair amount.
