Corn Cob Pipe and Button Nose: a Review
By: AWOM_Guitars

The other day I ordered a tin of C&D's new Christmas blend and it came in the mail yesterday. I smoked a bowl today and here are my thoughts. When I first opened the tin the smell hit me like a ton of bricks. The smell is outstanding, it reminds me of homemade hot chocolate my grandma makes during the Holidays. The cut to me seems a little small, but that doesn't phase me at all. It lights fairly easy, little to no problems. When I first lit it smoke went up my nose and I was in store for an unpleasant surprise. The thing with this tobacco is that it burns fairly slow, but quite warm. Mid bowl I started to get a nice chocolaty taste with a hint of rum, I also picked up a vanilla taste in there as well. It was hard to get a room note, because my nose was still quite uncomfortable from when I first lit it. The nic hit is subtle, so for heavy nicotine smokers you'll be a little disappointed. At the end of the bowl I didn't seem very satisfied, considering it was 85 degrees out. This is definitely a cold weather smoke. I'm going to jar this and open it up around Thanksgiving. I'll probably smoke another bowl when it gets a little cooler out, maybe in September, then I'll decide whether or not to buy another tin.

I was expecting mold.

But in a lighter side, I'm looking forward to this blend.  My 2 cans should be here later this week!
