Tobacco Review: J.F Germain's Medium Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 93

**Blend Name:** J.F Germain’s Medium Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** Pipe tobacco made with selected red and golden tobaccos. Pressed to create a flake of medium density and sliced for your enjoyment.

**Leaf:** Brown, broken flake, moist to wet from the tin. It doesn’t need an aggressive rub out, I learned to just wad up a loose ball and stick it whole in my pipe.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Fruit stripe gum, raisins, candy oranges, sweet tobacco, black pepper, candied ginger, wax

**Age when smoked:** 6 months

**Taste:** Starts toasty, toasty tobacco. Builds quickly into fruity flavors. This stuff is sweet, not quite cloying, but certainly towards the saccarhine end. There is an interesting touch of black pepper that balances the sweetness a bit. Artifical apricot. I suspect they get their casing from Erinmore as it is very similar in flavor, but of course applied to a much more mellow leaf the casing comes off stronger. There is a sharp vinegary tang here and there – is that the red or golden tobacco? Citrusy, but in a processed way, orange juice from concentrate. Grows even fruitier over time, along with additional sweetness. Is very consistent till the end, when the fruits back a bit and it is dry toast again.

**Nicotine:** 2-3, strong for an aromatic

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Despite its moisture content is pretty well behaved, even without any drying time. I would suggest minimal to no drying time to preserve the topping which is wont to evaporate. This stuff puffs up terribly at first so expect some extra charring-tamping cycles. The smoke is very pleasant, velvety and soft.
 
**Side Stream:** Fruity delicious.

**Thoughts:** I snagged this one when I was at Iwan Ries having never heard of it. I managed to show up there last April, when the last round of Esoterica madness was in full swing and they just got their shipment. Having never seen any German in store, I had to grab a few tins to investigate the hype, and of course use my reviews to smother or feed the flames of such. As it is, the Medium Flake is okay. I would have been much happier if the tin description was more honest, or that the tobacco matched the one they wrote. As it is, I was expecting a medium Virginia flake, something along the lines of OGS, Comoy’s Cask No. 4, the PS flake line, all some of my favorite smokes. What I got was an aromatic. A good aromatic mind you. A solid Type II aro – quality leaf with an additional flavoring, like Erinmore or Firedance. But when you want a 7-Eleven chili cheese dog, even Steak Diane will not satisfy. 

I am not sure if the Medium Flake has an Esoterica analogue. I tried to determine which if any Esoterica this might be, but came up empty. The description of Cardiff sounded very similar, but I’ve not had it so I cannot be sure.

Now the question truly at hand: does it live up to brand expectation? Meh. This particular blend is not discussed much if ever, but everything from Germain is considered top notch it seems – the whole ‘even a cheap Porsche is a Porsche’ mentality pushed me to buy an unknown tin when given the opportunity. The stuff is good, for what it is. The standout quality was the velvety like smoke. Seek it out? Nah. But if you are a fruity aromatic fanatic, well then maybe try to get ahold of some.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Erinmore, SG Medium Virginia Flake, Peter Stokebye Luxury Twist
 
**Summary:** A toasty Virginia flake Apricot aromatic

antiwittgenstein: /u/antiwittgenstein I would like to submit this review for the contest
--
antiwittgenstein: Dude, you are not eligible. I know you've smoked Stonehaven before man or at least own some. Even if you didn't the last thing this sub needs is more of your bloviating reviews.
--
antiwittgenstein: Ouch, that got a bit personal.
--
SupraMario: So what's your rating on this one? You left it off lol
--
antiwittgenstein: Imaginary creatures don't get ratings. I just don't feel like giving one to something that is rare. I couldn't grade it fairly anyway. So I left it blank. If this stuff becomes commonplace, at least not hyper-scarce, then I can come back and grade it.
--
SupraMario: I see lol, but isn't this pretty common in the UK?
--
antiwittgenstein: Maybe? Can we get a Brit to make a ruling here? Or are y'all out of practise doing that sort of thing?
--
SupraMario: /u/dai7 your from the UK right?
--
Dai7: That's correct.
--
crimblade: Don't worry about that guy, he's pretty cantankerous. We've learned to just smile and nod when he comes round the sub.
--
aelmer2821: He's right you know. If you have smoked it before, you are disqualified. Them's the rules from the egotist.

====================================
JasonWilsatch: I’m a VA VA/Per guy and I love this stuff. I think it is a great outdoor smoke. I consider it an all day smoke that stays in my rotation. I love the cut and the color of it as well as the smell. It’s a very well behaved smoke similar to brown flake. I don’t really consider this an aromatic. At least not in the American sense of the word. It’s a damn fine VA blend with a flavor enhancing casing. In other words strict aromatics smokers won’t like it but the guys like me who don’t touch aromatics at all it’s a really nice change of pace from straight VA blends and English’s. That’s my two cents on medium flake.

antiwittgenstein: Glad you enjoyed it. I was feeling a bit snarky and let myself get carried away a bit.
