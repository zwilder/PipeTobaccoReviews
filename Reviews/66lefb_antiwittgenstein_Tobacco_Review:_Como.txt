Tobacco Review: Comoy's Cask No. 5
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 86

**Blend Name:** Comoy’s Cask No. 5
 
**Description on Tin:** Bright orange Virginas and rich Burleys are blended together in Comoy's "Cask No.5", and topped with Tennessee bourbon flavor for a smooth flavor and civil room note.

**Leaf:** Short ribbon in a pretty even mix of light and dark browns.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Sweet and smoky. Plums and raisins, with some burnt sugar.

**Taste:** Sweet. I mean caramel sweet. I guess that is the whisky? Sometime starts a bit spirit and hot, like the vapors coming from a steaming hot toddy. Quickly the sweetness is enveloped, but not entirely subsumed, by earthiness. The burley component is earthy forward, with a strange just faintly smoky edge, with some deep nuttiness. I am going to say leans closer to walnuts than anything. Some of the virginias peak through, being orange centric citrus. It is not overly tangy or sour though. Neither the earth nor the citrus burns too bright for them to clash. Occasionally, especially when smoked greedily, or oftentimes, in the windy April nights we’ve been having, it turns a bit bitter – and bites. The citrus gives up at the bottom quarter or so, so it is just back to the workman’s burley. 

As a note: Smoke this out of a short, squat bowl. Seems to tame the spiritiness and lets the Virginia talk a bit louder.

**Aged when smoked:** About 13 months

**Nicotine:** 2-3. Rather light for such a burley forward blend

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Top notch. Dry to the touch from the jar. Had several bowls of this requiring no relights. However it will bite you if you let it get too hot.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside.

**Thoughts:** This isn’t a showy tobacco, but it isn’t supposed to be. It hits the expected notes, is enjoyable, but it not something you will rave about at your next pipe club. But not everything we laud has to be that elusive, mind blowing smoke. I hear, and contribute, frequent praise for everyday smokes like Carter Hall and Captain Black Royal, because they are attainable, consistent, and pleasant. Comoy’s Cask No. 5 fits in that category as well. It is like Old Grandad Bourbon, no you can’t say it’s just as good as a your preferred 18 year old Single Malt Scotch, but it isn’t trying to be. You buy it sip at it every day and don’t give it much thought.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Erin go Bragh, Carter Hall, Prince Albert, Briar Fox
 
**Summary:** A Earthy-orange Burley-Virginia blend with a quickly receding whisky topping

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

AnotherReaganBaby: I was on the fence about this one. 

I think I'll give a go. Been enjoying some milder aromatic stuff lately, usually as a pre-game for stronger stuff i plan on smoking later in the day. This sounds like a good one to put in the rotation.

Great review man.

serendipity_hunter: The bite is real with this blend. I do enjoy it. A lightly topped blend. Helps me take it slow and not smoke my tobaccos too hot
--
antiwittgenstein: When I was smoking it out of my Sav bent pot, I never noticed the bite. I threw it in my Big Ben straight billiard, and bam, vampire city.

serendipity_hunter: Lol yea I mainly smoke straight pipes small nose warmers. Longest pipe I have is a 5 1/4 inch Canadian Peterson lol. So I realized real fast to take it slow haha
