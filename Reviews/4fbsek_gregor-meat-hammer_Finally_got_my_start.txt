Finally got my starter kit in the post. I might post a review once I've had a go through.

As a note, there's a small metal screw looking thing in the stem thats fairly loose. Is this the filter?

====================================
levins0: Just so you know, if you smoke that Ennerdale in that pipe *once*, everything else you ever smoke in it will taste like Ennerdale.  If you like the Lakeland, then fine, but if not, you'll be sorry.  :)

I suggest you pick up an MM cob for the Ennerdale.

[Edit: Words mixed some up, Englishing good today not so.]

anxst: Yeah, I kind of can't believe there's a starter kit that has a single briar and ennerdale flake that doesn't include some kind of warning note, or an extra cob in the box just for that, or something.

--
xDemagog: The starter kit is meant to showcase the different styles found in the UK in hopes that it will introduce a beginner to a blend they like. It's kinda hard to compromise with Lakelands (or even Latakia blends) in that aspect, unfortunately. 
--
anxst: That's very very true. I'm not saying it's not a good kit! Just saying maybe even a note about pipe ghosting and lakeland (and as stated, Latakia blends) and how to deal with them in the future might not be a bad addition. Still, they'll learn eventually.

====================================
SupraMario: That's a stinger, it's basically a metal filter for collecting condensation.

====================================
aztecnology: How long did it take to receive the starter kit? I was checking it out last week and thinking about ordering one myself.
--
gregor-meat-hammer: I ordered mine last thursday with first class post and I believe it arrived today.
--
gregor-meat-hammer: As an extra note, going through GQ tobacco i've found a possibly much better deal, one i'm kicking myself for not finding it earlier.

mtn_mojo: Ooh, that thing is really cool. I wonder if any US based sellers have something similar? I would love to explore the basic components that go into most blends!
--
xDemagog: Place your order early enough in the day and it *should* be with you the next day (assuming everything is in stock). Those kits are nice but they're a bit more labor intensive than they let on ;)
--
====================================
DoubledPawns: The metal thing is probably a stinger and it will probably come out by twisting and pulling. I'd recommend taking it out, I've never been a fan.
--
====================================
Dai7: As already said that metal filter is called a stinger you can just remove it if you want. I'd try a bowl with it in and another with it out just to see how the pipe smokes, most people don't use stingers if it bothers you just remove it and smoke th epipe as normal. Ye use a cob for Ennerdale.
