Tobacco Review: Billy Budd

Review #35

**Blend Name:** Billy Budd

**Description on Tin:** A heavy Latakia blend with rough-cut Burley, bright Virginia, flake and a good amount of rough-cut cigar leaf. Created for C&D's late friend Sailorman Jack.
 
**Leaf:** Wide ribbon, nutty brown and Cavendish black, with some larger chunks in there.

**Tin Aroma:** Musty funk. Salty tangy – like the sea. Campfire smoke. Talisker 10?

**Taste:** Latakia and Perique. The Latakia is tangy, with just pinch of soap that dissipates after five or ten puffs. The smoke exudes a softness, yes on mouthfeel, but also in taste. I feel the elements have married well here. The softness might come from the balancing of the Latakia-Perique with Virginia, and Cigar leaf, but those don’t show quite yet. Plunging deeper the Virginia does speak, a lemon twist in your peaty scotch. It is a third row violin playing its heart out – you know it isn’t the star, but you know they are playing every note as if it were their last. Easing past the first third the Cigar leaf inches forward. It offers an earthiness quite unusual to pipe tobacco, a deeper, mellow sweetness that smacks of Maduro leaf. The C&D taste is in here too, quite prominent if you go looking for it, a bready-sour-funk. It offers the richest smoke I have had from a pipe, big galloping clouds sent windward. This is a busy tobacco, with many stories to tell. It is like one of those Richard Scary books I loved so when I was child – one page was so filled with life, a thousand little details catching one instant. I have put this review off far longer than any other tobacco as it is so hard to *know* - the epistemological current that has run through my last spate of reviews. But I will try hardily. 

The Virginia is really bright, which provides a zesty, complex counterpoint to the Cigar leaf. Through the middle of the bowl it evens out to this interplay of the Cigar leaf and the Virginia – earthy sweetness with high tones and lemony-spice. The Latakia and Perique at the beginning are gone – and I begin to suspect that it wasn’t Perique but the white pepper of a cigar. At times, especially at first light, this reminds me quite bit of the Punch Bareknuckle line of cigars. Towards the end it dwindles to a mellow-caramel-smoky roundness. I chase the embers with more fervor than is my general wont. I guess that means I like it.

**Nicotine:** Fairly powerful, but manageable. Three glasses of Bourbon.

**Smokability:** I usually air out everything but I was in a rush this evening so I packed it directly from the jar, as it has that classic C&D dryness. That was mistake. Give this a few minutes at least to rest. I blame the Cigar leaf. On that note, the large chunks of it make it a bit touchy to pack. Use a wide bowl and be ginger. I might try ripping those larger chunk up next time.

**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but I smell I liked I smoked stogie tonight. I will not be smoking this inside.

**Thoughts:** This tobacco has had my longest purchase to review delay thus far. It is not that I don’t enjoy it, but I when I smoked it in the past, I could never quite get a good feel for what was going on. My palate has developed immensely over the past year, but I think so has the tobacco. It is richer, fuller, with its components well integrated, but speak for themselves individual as well. 

As a Cigar to Pipe convert (I still smoke cigars, but they hold a secondary place in my heart and budget) I picked this up to see if there was a good middle ground. At first, it was no great shakes. Now, with some age on both of us, I can see that it does serve that purpose. It is an English blend, not a cigar stuck in my pipe, but it brings the deep round earth of cigars into the familiar Latakia-Oriental mixture.
Despite the hot weather, I was craving English, and this sated that craving, but today I was graced with good fortune, as the weather swung back down into the 40s (F). If you are a cold weather English smoker, grab some of this now, and by October it should have settled into itself, ready company for a brisk evening’s walk while you watch the whole world feign death in preparation for winter.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Mountain Camp, Balkan Sobraine, and Bosphorous Cruise have a similar heavy handy with Virginia or Oriental, but of course don’t have Cigar leaf to accompany it. This is my only such blend on hand. Quite like a Maduro cigar at times.

**Summary:** An Virginia heavy, earthy sweet Cigar laced English.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
CurlyFatAngry: Great review, I tried for the first time last weekend and was blown away with how good it was. It's quite the punch and I love it. 
--
====================================
ijustreadidontpost: I chase that caramel flavor, too.  This is good stuff.  I make sure I always have some on hand.
--
====================================
Chuzordie: Sinbad movies.. oh the memories..  early teen years and the skimpy 70s clevage.. wantin to Sinbad...  
--
Chuzordie: oh yea.. the review..  darn you brain with the memory and the feels..  lookin forward  to tryin this one .. wonder if i can break in that jaegerpipe i want with it. 
--
None: "Wanting to Sinbad" gave me a great chuckle! 

As for the review,  another one excellently written! I have a few C & D blends coming in tomorrow, one of which  is Habana Daydream, and I wonder how it compares? If I enjoy that blend, I'll absolutely  order some Billy Budd thanks to this review.
--
antiwittgenstein: Yeah, that Habana might be the next Cigar leaf blend I try, or maybe dip into McC Dominican Glory Line. It's nice to see a whole new subgengre of pipe tobaccodom open up to me.
--
====================================
TurnerJ5: Excellent review.
--
antiwittgenstein: For some reason I can't take your opinions at face value when I laud praises upon your product. One day I will find a real C&D stinker and we will test your mettle eh?
--
====================================
hedonaut: I'm really enjoying your reviews as time goes on, as well as your metaphysical and epistemological musings. This was an odd blend for me. I enjoyed it, but its seemed busy and noisy as so many fresh blends do. I suspect a few months in the jar/tin is exactly what it needs to really take on that final polish. On a scale of Scifi/Action flicks from Space Mutiny to Aliens, I rate this review 5th Element (++++.5).
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks, and thanks for playing along. I still haven't seen Aliens, just Alien. It probably explains many of my other personal flaws, which would be fixed if only I see this seminal film.

I looked back and saw I ordered this last May, so it has been in my possession a full year before I really got it, and that out of pure cussedness. I think it would be good policy to for me to buy a chunk of this and let it age for a few years to see what happens - those VAs are beautiful now. Once they reach kindergarten the should be phenomenal. 
--
hedonaut: The general consensus among the C&D devoted seems to be they are at their best when allowed to rest and marry for six months to a year after tinning date. It makes perfect sense given the scale of production and so forth. A handful of guys blending raw leaf in a single room can create great stuff, but it means they lack the massive warehouse of thousands of tins like a larger scale production might have. 
--
antiwittgenstein: In the future - i.e when I leave grad school and get a real job - I would not mind paying premium for something like Billy Budd Reserve - leaf held back for that 6 months or a year so it is amazing right off the truck. But right now I am poor and patient. And really am going to start buying English in the Spring and Virginia in the ~~Fall~~ Always to be ready for my tastes that season.
--
hedonaut: That's one way to do it. I alway buy by the pound faster than I can smoke. That guarantees a constantly improving cellar. 
--
====================================
Darwin7848: AW if the always brilliant Charles Laughton had not been cast as Captain Bligh I would have stuck the '35 Bounty down at the bottom.  Clark Gable was catastrophically miscast as Fletcher Christian.  Purely a butts in the seats move.  I also would have swapped places for the O'Brian and Forrester.  M&C is unbelievably dense with period detail for which I'm a sucker.
--
antiwittgenstein: I looked forward to this movie with relish, I love tales of the sea (obviously) and really enjoy the work of Franchot Tone - he was pretty solid but badly directed. The pace and motion of the movie is completely off. It is on the cusp of being enjoyable, but no.

I ready HH before M&C so its primacy might be purely historical - I love both sets dearly. I need to delve into Alexander Kent - my sister, who introduced me to all this, thinks he is up there with Forrester and O'Brian.
--
Darwin7848: I have to say that even as barely believable as Brando was the later Bounty version is superior.  Trevor Howard of course was always a pleasure to watch.  Crowe as Aubrey was not a terrible choice but wouldn't it be nice if an actor could be found to play a British ship commander who is, well, *actually British*?
--
====================================
peckinpahhombre: Great review.  I love the stuff, though it is primarily a winter smoke for me.  It is certainly the best blend with cigar leaf that I have yet to try.
--
antiwittgenstein: Which other's have you had? Any you can recommend?
--
peckinpahhombre: I prefer Billy Budd to the other three I have tried - namely, Key Largo, Robusto and Spectre.

For me Key Largo is the runner up to Billy Budd for best cigar blend.
--
====================================
tennesseean_87: Is there actually Perique in this blend?
--
antiwittgenstein: I don't think so. I write em up before I read the description, so I don't always know what is what. It is more honest that way.

The pepper is almost undoubtedly from the cigar leaf. 

--
tennesseean_87: I always read the description first, but I do stay away from other's reviews until I've done my review or at least made most of my notes for it.
