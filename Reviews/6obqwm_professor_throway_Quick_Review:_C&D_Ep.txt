Quick Review: C&D Epiphany
By: professor_throway
---
* Blend Name: Epiphany

* Description on Tin: We have a delightful new light English blend called Epiphany. Epiphany is reminiscent of the original Revelation blend that was said to be the favorite of a certain reknowned thinker named Einstein. Epiphany is another classic Tarler/Runowski blend of Va, Burleys, Latakia and Perique in perfect balance and harmony.

* Cut: Rough ribbon. Typical C&D

* Pouch Aroma: Smells like a light english (duh!). A little hay, a little raisin, a little smoke.

* Taste: Medium to Mild. The latakia and perique are really in the background. The latakia is condimental, I keep picking it up and wanting more. The perique is not distinguishable except on the retrohale. Sweet and a little grassy notes from the VA with a solid burley base.

* Strength: Pretty medium. More than Carter Hall but not by too much. 

* Smokability: Burns without issue. Bulk from local B&M was at perfect moisture. Easy to pack. 

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. Seems pretty inoffensive.

* Thoughts: The only reason I am writing the review is because of how my experience with this tobacco changes depending on the situation. I have smoked about 2 oz over the last several months and depending on the day I would tell you meh it is nothing special and a bit boring or WOW! it is a really satisfying smoke. It took me until this morning to realize it depends on what I am doing. If having a bowl is my primary activity, late at night when everyone else is asleep and I am smoking to relax, this is really kind of boring to me. It is OK, but I keep thinking I want to smoke something else. This morning I had the house to myself and decided to have a bowl while grading papers on the deck. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It stayed lit with no problem, it provided the right amount of pleasure without being distracting. I think this is an example of a blend from another time, made for a different kind of smoker. When people were not smoking an occasional bowl as a hobby, but rather for all day nicotine delivery. For when you smoked while you worked at your desk or smoked while reading the evening paper. It is a smoke to accompany your task and pleasantly sit in the background. Like having a Budweiser with your neighbor after mowing the lawn. The taste and alcohol isn't the main show, but it gives you an excuse to stand at the edge of your driveway for half an hour talking about the weather. Now that I have that sorted out, I think I will enjoy this blend a bunch more.

* My Background: Cigarette smoke for 20 years. Quit 8 years ago and intermittently smoked a pipe or cigar. In the last year picked up the pipe much more and smoke about 5-7 bowls a week.

edit:formating. One day I will get it right the first time.
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the write up prof. I've had similarly inconsistent blends, McLelland 25 or 27, Comoy Cask 5, and Bacon Old Fashioned. One day it was terrible or solidly meh. The next, amazing. Try as I might to isolate the variables, drying time, pipe, environmental conditions, the smoke was just too fickle. It does make it interesting though. Like dating a redhead, you don't exactly know who you are gonna get any given day.

professor_throway: For some reason I read Bacon Old Fashioned as Beacon Extra and was very confused! 

I am not sure fickleness is reserved for redheads though, my thoroughly blonde wife from eastern European stock can give me whiplash based on how fast she changes her mind. It is all part of the adventure.

====================================
zero-hunter: The first time I had this, the nicotine walloped me. I'm sensitive to nic, but I can handle Englishes up to Nightcap level. For some reason, this blend destroyed me. I've never downed a Coke so fast. 
--
professor_throway: It's strange how different blends affect different people. I thought this was pretty light in the nicotine department. Maybe it is the burley that hits you harder?
--
zero-hunter: I'm going to have to revisit it and find out. Maybe I didn't have enough on my stomach. It is a tasty blend though. 
--
====================================
badmongo666: Probably my favorite American English. Agreed that it's more of a "puff along while doing something else" blend (albeit about as strong as I'd care for of that type), but for that application it's mighty nice. 
--
====================================
asrialdine: I've had the same experience as you with this blend.  When I sit on the deck and smoke it while reading a book I LOVE the blend.  A while ago I smoked it without doing something else and it was extremely mediocre.  If I could smoke at work this would probably be in my pipe all the time, but since this isn't the 50's, I guess I'll have to save it for my reading time.
--
====================================
SwampGentleman: I may revisit this someday, but as a new smoker it bit my head off. A few others online have mentioned it- perhaps now I'll have a more careful cadence, but I'm afraid if that raisiny topping is unforgiving to my body
--
professor_throway: I thought the topping was really light, I hardly noticed it at all. It can get bitey on you though. I felt it a bit today after 2 bowls.
--
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Thanks for the review!
--
professor_throway: The reviews are my favorite part of this subreddit. Want to keep the momentum going. Plus putting things down helps clarify my own thoughts and ideas on different blends.
--
====================================
pipeandpendulum: Nice review man!  I just found a jar of this from 2009. Need to give it a shot!  Thanks for the write up 
--
professor_throway: I think if you don't expect too much from it, and think of it in the context of an all day smoke, you will enjoy it.
--
====================================
Aboleth_Whisperer: I recall this one having some nice dark fruit notes.  Looking through the comments makes me wonder if I am indeed thinking of a different blend.  Did you pick up on anything like that, OP?
--
professor_throway: Personally I didn't. A lot of reviews mention a pretty distinct topping reminiscent of rum and fruit. In my sample that didn't come through. I did buy mine at a B&M out of their bulk jar so maybe it was older or not stored optimally. Maybe I should grab a tin of it next time.
