So I tried Ennerdale for the first time...(review + pictures)

I posted [this newbie question](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/64tqdm/what_are_your_favorite_aromatics/) about aromatics a few days ago and a couple guys mentioned I should try Ennerdale, so I bought some.

After ordering, I looked at some reviews and became worried that I would be one of the many people who considers Ennerdale a soapy, disgusting mess. I was apprehensive upon opening the tin after it arrived.

However, I think it tastes sublime. Definite flower and citrus notes, both from the tin and the retrohale. There was also a certain "oily" mouthfeel to the smoke, as if the smoke was very dense. This combined with the citrus notes and provides a sort of 'citronella' aspect to the smoke, in a very delicious way. The flake is gorgeous looking, like an old hardwood board, and I only needed minimal drying time (15min) before gently rubbing it out and packing a full bowl. Even with some larger "strips" of flake still in the bowl, it burned wonderfully. Right in the sweet spot between too fast and too slow. Hardly touched my lighter. The flavor and the room note gave me some kind of vague nostalgia about a sweet aroma I must have smelled at one point long ago, but can no longer remember what it was. My gf felt the same way about the room note, though she was less enthusiastic about the flavor than I was.

Very relaxing smoke that paired very well with an Einst√∂k pale ale and (later) black tea. I won't soon forget that first smoke. Wonderful. 

I'm still somewhat new to pipe smoking, so at this point I'm curious for new experiences and I NEVER smoke the same thing twice in a row. However, last night I smoked 3 bowls of Ennerdale back-to-back. 

Super pleased, and I thank those who recommended it. 

As an added bonus, my first pipe, [this pre 1980 GBD New Era 867 bent billiard](https://i.imgur.com/0ILQJXg.jpg), had started giving me a very off-putting, very plasticky flavor no matter what I smoked through it. I think it was caused by storing it in my dehumidified gun safe in relatively close proximity with gun oils/solvents (lesson learned!).

However, after 1/2 a bowl of Ennerdale, there isn't a trace of that awful flavor any more. The plastic ghost has been completely exorcised, and I couldn't be happier to have my first and favorite pipe back in the rotation (even if i'll reserve it for Ennerdale only duty).

[Here's a picture of it with my 1970s LaStrada Volare 171 bent bulldog and my Savinelli Orient 344KS straight Brandy](https://i.imgur.com/Lx6lmhv.jpg)

I use the Volare for english blends, and the Orient for Virginias/aromatics.

I still need more pipes, of course. 

Thanks for reading.

hello_josh: I had my first taste of Ennerdale Flake and loved it. It reminds me of Earl Grey tea, which I also love. Something about that blend is so relaxing and soothing.
--
AnotherReaganBaby: Yeah it really is a soothing smoke. I still can't put my finger on what that nostalgic aroma is, but it leads to good feelings and a real comfy experience.
--
hello_josh: So true. I don't know that I've smelled it before but it has something nostalgic in the aroma. Cozy.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Great review of a tobacco I hope to never smoke.
--
givemeyours0ul: Please please please try it! I want to read your review so badly.....

pipedrum22: Dude...so pumped that you like it! One of my all time favorites.

zero-hunter: Any noticeable nic hit?
--
AnotherReaganBaby: For me, it was a good amount. I'd say a medium nic level, based on the other stuff I have in my collection. It's not as strong as something like Bayou Morning or Nightcap, but I definitely feel it. But then again, I only smoke once or twice a week, so your mileage may vary.

I smoked cigarettes for 15 years, but quit years ago. Not sure if I still have some nicotine tolerance carried over from that, lol. 
--
caesarenricobandello: Ennerdale is much stronger than nightcap
--
zero-hunter: Dang, guess until I build up a tolerance, I'll have to avoid it. What's a good Lakeland with mild nicotine?
--
caesarenricobandello: It's not a very heavier blend either I just don't think Nightcap is all that strong
--
Dai7: #7 broken flake is similar to ennerdale give that a go instead. Or Kendal Flake https://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/gawith-hoggarth-kendal-flake-pipe-tobacco/1476938/
--
AnotherReaganBaby: Is it? I have a hard time discerning nic level from time to time. Lot of variables in how/when I smoke. 
--
====================================
damadfaceinvasion: I just ordered an oz of it after reading this. I want to try  Lakeland blend but don't know where to start.  Glad they sell this in bulk because if I hate it I wont have a full tin of it sitting around.  Well see how it goes I guess. I have an old cob I'll dedicate to this stuff. 

I don't mind "soapy" taste so I think I'll like it.
