In September of 2004 I went to see the French electronic-melodic-ambiant band Air at the Hollywood Bowl. With the exception of this Thanksgiving, which has been hotter than the blue part of a flame, Los Angeles is lovely in the fall. It‚Äôs mild during the day and evenings are usually cool and clear. Perfect for sitting in a huge amphitheater, staring up at the darkening sky and enjoying good wine, good company and good music. One of our friends had bought (well, knowing him it‚Äôs more likely he scammed) several ‚Äútables‚Äù, which are essentially four person booths up front. Everyone at the bowl brings a picnic and drinks and it is truly one of the nicest experiences to be had in Los Angeles. I highly recommend it.

Now, I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Air, I mean I liked them well enough but to be honest I was there because my girlfriend wanted to go. How bad could it be anyway? All of our friends would be there and we would be under the stars and have plenty of wine, there are worse ways to spend a few hours.

The show started out well, everyone talking and joking. Some of my co-workers came down from the bleachers to marvel at our good fortune with our seats. My head swelled a bit from wine and praise. Air were good. They were supporting Talkie Walkie which is a great record and they had a lot of "hip cred" locally, having done the soundtrack for Sophia Coppola‚Äôs The Virgin Suicides and one of the songs from Lost In Translation. Very quickly I realized this was one of those evenings, one of those times in life where everything falls perfectly in place and would be with me forever. As the band played through their set I noticed musicians coming on stage to join them. ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs Beck‚Äù I realized as a moppy-head trundled out with an acoustic guitar. Someone else pointed out that Stereo Lab, had snuck on stage and were playing, too. ‚ÄúIs that Trent Reznor?‚Äù someone asked. And though no one was sure, a few thought they recognized Thom Yorke. What started out being not much more than a good chance for a decent night organically evolved into one of the best nights I have had.

**The Blender:** We‚Äôve already talked about The Country Squire in Jackson, MS. Established in 1970. Jon David Cole is the current proprietor and blender. This is their Christmas 2017 seasonal blend.

**The Blend:** Figgy Pudding

**The Tin:** Zip-lock something-or-other, who cares?! Keep reading! (Figgy Pudding is only sold in 2oz servings, buy early and buy often)

**The Tobacco:** Deep Burley ribbons and a scattering of Virginias with dark chips of Black Cavendish. It‚Äôs slightly damp as you would expect but try to resist drying it. That will make it a little easier to control and pack and you will get more of the lovely flavors. It behaves well enough and lights easily.

**Upon Opening:** This is your first hint that something is a little different here. Something special is going on. The tin note is full and robust. Vanilla and cocoa and cherry a subtle, intentionally sweet and sour clove somewhere between the cocoa and the cherry. Port wine? and surprisingly, some faint hay from the Virginia.

**The Smoke:** Ok, wow! That smells SO good! I mean really good, I can‚Äôt quite get over how good, good. You know, I‚Äôm going to be really disappointed when I don‚Äôt actually taste any of that olfactory feast. I strike a match and begin the ember ‚Äì ohmy‚Ä¶.. OHmy! ohmymymy‚Ä¶. Oh this is it! This is one of them, one of those elusive discoveries beyond all expectation! Oh my god! Is this the best aromatic I have ever smoked? I mean it might be! This might be the best one! I can taste every single aroma like some kind of magical Christmas dessert. Some cherry here, boom, chocolate, oh, I like the vanilla and wine together, cherry again. And the tobaccos are all there, mature and sophisticated. Adults keeping the children‚Äôs exuberant play loosely contained. They are having a blast but you know there is a deliberate structure to give them the room to run. The whole thing settles down as you get toward the bottom of the bowl and becomes like a melted ice-cream sundae soup. It burns well, you‚Äôll probably get a little dottle. People in the room will love this tobacco blend almost as much as you will. There‚Äôs nicotine here but not much.

**Conclusion:** I had planned to do one more aromatic review in this series and had been building up towards introducing people to McClelland‚Äôs EL-7. Which, until yesterday afternoon, was my favorite, everyday ‚Äì allday aromatic. It‚Äôs very good, please do give it a try especially if you like cocoa, caramel and maple. But Figgy Pudding is incredible. It is everything an aromatic is supposed to be! Full and delicious, dense and playful, tangy and sweet.

Caveat smoker! It is a seasonal blend, which means it‚Äôs already in limited supply and I am terrified that the FDA regulations will kick in before next Christmas making it prohibitive for Jon David Cole to ever produce it again. I went back and bought a pound before posting this, so if [The Country Squire]( https://www.thecountrysquireonline.com/product/christmas-blend-2016/) runs out before you get any, blame me. ‚Ä¶and tell me, because if they actually do run out and you don‚Äôt get any, I will send you some. You really must try it so you will know what the best aromatic made smokes like.


**Strength:** Medium  2/4	**Room:** Medium 2/4	**Taste:** Medium 2/4	**Overall:** 4/4

====================================
MWooten34: Great review!! Looking forward to trying some myself!
--
AdamantFinn: Thank you, you're going to love it!
--
====================================
Leoscat: Sounds like an amazing smoke to go with a magical night. Nothing quite like the bowl on a starry night üòÑ
--
AdamantFinn: Sadly, you can't smoke at the Bowl anymore. Maybe they'll reconsider if we bring them some Figgy Pudding!
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Wow, that is some ad copy. Having just been thoroughly disappointed by Sutliff Christmas Spice I might have to check this one out. Have you had any of the other Holiday blends? Have thoughts or comparisons with Figgy Pudding?
--
AdamantFinn: Well, I'm flattered that you still trust me after I led you astray with Christmas Spice. I will say that Figgy Pudding is more robust and the flavors more sophisticated than those in Christmas Spice. Figgy Pudding is less muddled. I'm a little nervous that I'll let you down twice!

I've had a couple of the the McClelland Christmas Cheer blends. I bought a tin of Corn Cob Pipe last year that I did not care for at all but I re-visited it a few weeks ago and it has developed into something that I like very much. Figgy Pudding is not like either, btw.

For comparison, I would say it's similar to but more involved than Drew Estate - Central Park Stroll. It is more flavorful and a little heavier than Esoterica - Hastings.

====================================
AvatarTHW: Picked up 10oz myself. Jon David really does know how to put together an amazing blend!

--
AdamantFinn: I hope you enjoy it at least as much as I do. I spoke with Caleb at The Country Squire, today. Apparently he had a hand in creating this blend so credit should be given to him as well.
--
====================================
Old_Deadhead: Very nice review! I'm not typically an aero guy, but I admit you've got me ready to order a sample. 


Thanks! 
--
AdamantFinn: Thank you! I've appreciated your reviews as well!
--
====================================
pipeandpendulum: Did you happen to get enough to share a sample?  This review was excellent and has me convinced.  Im a sucker for seasonal blends...
--
AdamantFinn: That is kind of you to say!
