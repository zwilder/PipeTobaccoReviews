Tobacco Review: Frog Morton Cellar
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 14

**Blend Name:** McClleland’s Frog Morton Cellar

**Description on Tin:** Frog Morton's Cellar is a smooth Latakia-based blend containing Virginias, but no Orientals, with the smoky leaf added in a moderate amount. But what makes this blend so unique is the addition, in each tin, of a cube cut from a stave from a whiskey barrel, which gently infuses the leaf with a subtle, tangy note that sets it apart from other English-style blends.
 
**Leaf:** Short wide flat ribbon, mostly black, with a smattering of yellow.

**Tin Aroma:** Booze. More like rum than whisky. A very subtle smokiness.

**Taste:** The defendant stands accused of being an aromatic with an English base. How do you plead?

*Not guilty.*

Would the accused like to take the stand? 

*I do solemnly swear by Odin’s beard, yatah yatah yatah. Look, I smell like candies and an MGM circa 1965 grandfather, but you got me wrong babe, I’m an English. Always have been, always will be.*

**Strike that from the record please. It would please the court if the defendant could refrain from undue verbosity without answering a direct question. Now if the prosecution would like to continue.**

Thank you your honor. Now, in your own words, what do you taste like?

*I am all wood smoke baby, at least that is how I start out. I like to be a little floral, maybe through a bit of spice there to mix things up.*

Could you be more specific?

*Do I look like Julia Childs? I don’t know spice. I guess. Jeez you have me on the spot. It reminds me a bit of Thai coffee. What are those pods they put in there? All black and seed looking?*

Cardamom I believe.

*Well then that’s me I guess, cardamom seeds.*

Is that all?

*No, come on, I am just getting started. Once I really start chugging I hit Virginia-ville. I mean big time. I keep my wood smoke. My florality. My spice-I mean cardamom seed taste. But I grow sweeter, tangy. I mean I am throwing orange and lemon left hooks and short black pepper jabs to the nose. And you know what, somewhere, I go all coffee and cocoa on you. Don’t ask me where it comes from. But like an earthy cigar, I when I fill out, I really push in all directions.*

Aha! Then you admit you are flavored with something. 

*No that’s natural flavoring. You can’t tell me otherwise. How about this for an aromatic. Vinegar. Bam. You ever taste vinegar in one of them PG laden candy smokes? How about smoke? How about salt? You think I’m some Molto Dolce knock off in an ugly tin?*

But the true mark of an aromatic is how it smells. Tell us now, in your own words, what does the room smell like after you’ve been smoked?

**Room Note:**  *Maple syrup, woodsy, a whiff of smoke, a bit like cologne. A manly refined scent.*

Then you admit it, you are an aromatic. The prosecution rests.

**Smokability:** Dry it a little, pack it firm. The smoke is thick and creamy.

**Thoughts:** What is an aromatic? For me, the word conjures up flavourless black Cavendish heavily cased with goopy chemicals that produces more steam than smoke, and more smell than flavor. This is not that. What is an English blend? Legend has it, any sort of mixture containing Virginia untainted with additional flavorings. But no one uses that anymore. English means Virginia and Latakia. This is an English blend, through and through. There might be some complexity brought in by the whisky topping, but it is most noticeable in the room note. You can smoke this in mixed company or in your lakeside lodge.

As an English this is particularly good one. It never gets soapy. The Latakia is there but more restrained than in other blends. The Virginias, as you would expect from McClelland’s, are top notch.

**Summary: Verdict. A sweet and tangy English blend with an aromatic room note.**

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 8 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**++++

Rating system (interpreted through the great fires of history):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Soviet Scorched Earth 1941)

(++++) Great (Moscow 1812)

(+++) Very good (The Great Fire of London 1666)

(++) Good (Atlanta, 1865)

(+) I think like it (Rome, 64)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Chicago, 1871)

(-) I think I dislike this (Texas City, 1947)

(--)This is not for me (Dresden, 1945)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (The Firebombing of Tokyo, 1945)

(----)This is suffering (Peyton Manning, Indianapolis, 2012)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (The Library of Alexandria, 48 B.C.)

possumburg: Awesome review! I love how you guys make these reviews fun to read.

--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I think I let myself get a little carried away this time, glad you liked it.
--
====================================
None: C cool review. I'd be smoking some cellar right now had usps not messed up my shipmentt
--
====================================
pixeechick: Right on target. I had some for the first time this week, and I'm not sure if I liked smoking it more or being side-stream on a walk that featured it prominently. Okay, I think the latter, but only because it has (for me) the quintessential grandpa pipe tobacco scent to it. 

And why no San Francisco?
--
antiwittgenstein: That one almost made it in, but I had to make a football pun instead. There are too many good fires, it was hard to choose. I am just happy no one pointed out the complete tastelessness of the rating scheme.
--
pixeechick: Truly. I think they let you off the hook for the Colts reference. 
--
====================================
Flatticus: Excellent review as always, antiwittgenstein.  
--
====================================
Localdefense: I think every order I've placed has had some kind of Frog Morton in it since I discovered it. Probably a good desert island baccy. Great review, mate.
--
====================================
tslextslex: Nifty review and you managed to address the issues that had discouraged me form buying this blend. FMOTT is my "big jar" tobacco, my default. This stuff, though, sounded gimicky and -- yeah -- like a run down the aromatic road.

But your review seems clearly to debunk such notions. So I'm in; I'll give it a try.

(Any chance you are on the pipesmagazine.com forum?)

--
antiwittgenstein: It is a bit gimmicky, but it is delicious. And no, no I am not. This is my only pipe forum presence.
--
====================================
None: I have a new tin coming in today.  This is my favorite smoke by far these days.
--
====================================
_troubadour: Great review. And a great tobacco. It was my bridge to English blends.
--
====================================
pipingphil: This must be the most cinematic review of anything I've ever read. Now I'm once more sad we don't get this over in Europe, at least not very easily.  
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I felt a bit weird posting this, but I have a strange compulsion to be exactly myself whenever confronted with a white shimmering expanse of textspace.
--
====================================
jholen: Would this be the first offering you'd recommend to try in the frog Morton lineup? I've enjoyed both Dunhill 965 and McClelland 5100.

Thanks for the review! Very entertaining. 
--
bovinitysupreme: I've tried most of the Frog lineup and, as a fan of campfirey latakia blends, I would recommend original Frog Morton to try first.
--
jholen: Thanks! 
--
antiwittgenstein: I've only had this one, but I think I would say yes. It gets the overall best reviews which led me to choose it above the others. From a 965 comparison, it is not as intense, either in complexity or nicotine, but feels rounder and softer instead.
