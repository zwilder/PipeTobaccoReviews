====================================
freepancakesforall: **Blend Name:** Cornell & Diehl's Dreams of Kadath    

**Official Description:** "Your journey to Kadath will not be an easy one. Before you descend the steps into the Dreamlands, prepare yourself with this fragrant blend of dark-fired Kentucky, Katerini, Perique, Virginia, Burley, and black Cavendish."     

**Appearance:** A whole lot of everything. It's a plug made up of lots of different small leaf tobacco. It's workability is about 95% plug and 5% krumble. Meaning that when slicing, chunks of leaves will just fall out of the plug and crumble. Not too bad. A couple of stems to discard and some unworkable sections, but overall a lovely presentation. The profile is gorgeous with a lovely distribution of leaf.    

**Tin Aroma:** This was one of the harder ones to pinpoint for me. The first thing to hit me was a sweet, slightly sour liquor note. Like a fine cognac. The topping reminded me a LOT of GL Pease Sixpence. Which I also suspect is a cognac/brandy. So if you love that topping, you'll love this one. Beneath that it gets a little tricky. There's just a bit of everything coming at you. I could pick up the dark fired pretty easily but there were some interesting notes I just couldn't put a finger on. I'm guessing that's the katerini.    

**Taste:** The cognac topping from the tin aroma barely transitions over to the taste. It's a VERY mild addition. The perique was noticeable for me right away, with dark fruits and pepper, as was the earthy, smokey dark fired. And while the virginia presence was obvious, I'd say the main highlights of this blend were the perique and dark fired. So I'd classify this as a BurPer with virginia for body and sweetness, cavendish for smoothness, and katerini for a floral, woodsy complement. There's also the faintest of cocoa in there. The retrohale was mostly peppery while the sidestream was dominated by the dark fired. If I had to smell the sidestream blindfolded I'd have sweared it was a cigar. Or semois. Very woodsy, earthy burley. But maybe that was the katerini. I don't know. I normally save these rambling thoughts until after I've smoked something at least four or five times.    

**Closing Thoughts:** To date, this is the most impressive Cornell & Diehl blend I've ever smoked. It's been a struggle to find "that blend" from C&D but this one comes awfully close. It's complex, it's flavorful, it lights and smokes well, and most of all it's just plain interesting!      

**Similar Blends:** I'd say I haven't found one too close yet. I've heard GL Pease Temple Bar strikes a similar chord, so I'll see about that in the near future.

chewsyourownadv: [My least loved Lovecraft story,](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.aspx), but maybe my favorite of C&D's Old Ones lineup. I need to spend some more time with it to be sure.

I'm not entirely sure there is much in the way of a topping here. Something tells me there's some kind of magic in the way Katerini and Kentucky play together that gives it that sweet aroma.

You're right, it is difficult to find some blend to compare it to. It's a sweet, floral dark-fired Kentucky abomination. A delicious, wonderful abomination.

freepancakesforall: I agree that I’m not entirely sure on the topping either. But the tin note very much reminds me of Sixpence. Maybe it’s psychological at this point. But it’s a fantastic smoke.

givemeyours0ul: I'm 100% certain this is topped, and fairly heavily. The way it tastes charred (like burnt sugar) when pushed, the way it disappears at the half way point, the tin note, the soaking wet dottle, etc. I like it though. I would call this an excellent hybrid or crossover blend. The tobacco is too good for it to be a standard gooper.

zachwad22: Nice review! Try Miskatonic Mixture too if you haven't, I think it shows off the Katerini a bit more.

phogeddaboudit: Damn, this is one of the two that were sold out when I first tried to order the whole series... I wasn't too happy with one of them, can't remember which right now, but this sounds really lovely. Innsmouth was pretty tasty, as well.

RegicideBrown: I've got a tin coming on Friday, so this review is wonderfully timed! I hope I enjoy it as much as you obviously did.

freepancakesforall: It was pretty good fresh. I think some aging is going to do incredible things.
