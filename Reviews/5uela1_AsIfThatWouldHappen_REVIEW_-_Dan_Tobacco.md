REVIEW - Dan Tobacco Little Wren.
By: AsIfThatWouldHappen

====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: As I mentioned in a post a few days back, I have been slack in my smoking lately, I have been neglecting my pipes and tobacco and haven't had much time to enjoy the hobby.

I am rectifying that now, and have gone through my backlog of tasting notes to bring some overdue reviews to you guys, as a few might remember I used to do them often and really enjoyed it, so I am starting again.

First up is this little beauty from Dan Tobacco. Hope you enjoy. As always C&C Welcome.

DESCRIPTION - In fairy tales, he swung with List on the king of birds: The wren - one of the smallest, most insignificant birds on our latitudes, but one of the loudest! A fitting name for this Ready Rubbed Cut Plug. Light brown Virginia with a hint of Black Cavendish, pressed together and matured, refined with a new attractive flavor, fresh, with sweet and floral tones, incredibly soft and fragrant. A truly "royal" pleasure.

Leaf: Ready Rubbed Cut Plug as per description, short/moderate length pieces of broken tobacco, still fairly dense but easy to rub out or break up more. I left it as is. Medium brown Va’s with maybe 20%-30% Black Cavendish. A Uniformly medium/dark blend. 

Tin Aroma: This blend smells great, it has a strong stewed fruit, cake like aroma, slightly floral but not soapy, not sure if it has maybe a liquor topping but there is a hint of something not unlike it there, almost like wine or a port smell, likely from the fruitiness. Does not smell like a cheap, artificial aro.

Taste: While not a particularly one dimensional smoke, it certainly wasn’t complex. I would describe it as “consistent”. Surprisingly it tasted much like it smelled, though not as intense. The fruitiness is there, the VA’s are fresh and grassy, and the floral comes through just a hint but there is no soapiness that can turn some smokers off (or on if you are one of those Lakeland loving characters....I kid) The fruitiness in the smoke was much less pronounced than in the aroma but still lingered, which I think attributed to the slight tanginess I picked up.
As an all day smoke it was easy to handle and very satisfying to puff on while going about your work. The nicotine level was a surprise when I packed my first large bowl and puffed away mindlessly, quite a kick for what I would call an aromatic. Stayed pleasant from start to finish with little to no transitioning. Definitely a fresh, high quality blend.

Smokability: Tobacco was a little on the moist side but I never bothered drying it and never had a drama. I never needed more than a standard amount of relights and didn’t get moisture coming from it as I smoked. Always burned all the way to the bottom to a good grey ash with no wet left over’s. Didn’t burn hot or nasty and was friendly on the tongue. Very easy to smoke.

Summary: As a fan of bigger bolder blends this was a welcome change of pace, especially as an “Aro”, although not the typical, gooey, artificial flavored type. Great fresh blend for warm weather, low maintenance, good simple, clean flavor that doesn’t require investment to enjoy, good nicotine levels too. I have another two tins which I am looking forward to getting to. Well worth a look as a bit of a crossover, Aro/Va blend.

EDIT: Score for Review Archive!
2.5/5

chewsyourownadv: Sounds kinda interesting. I immediately wondered how it might compare to Ennerdale and the like.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Couldn't tell you. Would likely be more floral then the above but other than that just guessing. I only had a small sample of Ennerdale when I first started, it came in my GQ starter kit. Smelled like dried flowers and from memory tasted the same, but I was too new to work it out.

====================================
SupraMario: Nice review, I've honestly been very surprised by every Dan Tobacco offering, which most of their stuff is Aros.  
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thank you.
I have two pouches of Salty Dogs at home aging for me, got close to 2 years on them now, may need to crack one open and see how it's travelling. I have heard great things. Other than that I would love to try Bill Baileys Balkan Blend and St. Bernards flake from them.
--
SupraMario: I've been wanting to try Salty Dogs for a while now, but I just cannot justify the price...
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: I'll be sure to do a full review and help you decide if it's worth the stretch. Sadly I'm half a world away and cant share a smoke with you.
--
SupraMario: True, this is the unfortunate part of our dying hobby, there are so few of us these days that getting a group together requires full blown planning to take place. 

I look forward to your review of Salty Dogs, hopefully it's worth it, because I'm a big fan of plugs
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: An even sadder reality in Australia where smoking brings serious shame on you. We have a pretty good community on Facebook though we are fairly spread out.

Looking forward to the review.

SupraMario: Yea, I know what you mean, people do the same here...smoking has this stigma to it, but the same people will get shit faced and say "smoking is bad for you"...well so is binge drinking every weekend...but the ads on TV are beer and alcohol commercials, not for pipe tobacco.

caesarenricobandello: Same although the reviews make it sounds more like Firedance than a Rum flavored plug. The Gawith Hoggarth Navy Plug was incredible
--
caesarenricobandello:  It seems like their Virginia aromatics bite like hell
--
SupraMario: I've got a few of them, you just have to give them ample dry time.
--
caesarenricobandello: Doesn't make a difference in my case. I don't like Dan Tobacco, I'll stick with the Lakelands
--
SupraMario: Completely understand, most people dislike aros in general.
--
caesarenricobandello: I love the quality aromatics made by Gawith Hoggarth & Samuel Gawith, I just don't like Dan Tobacco
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: It is definitely High Quality leaf and well produced tobacco, but you can't help if it the taste isn't what you are after. I rarely to never smoke anything Aromatic and I really enjoyed this blend.
