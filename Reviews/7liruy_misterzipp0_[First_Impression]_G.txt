[First Impression] GL Pease's Barbary Coast (Christmas theme review)
By: misterzipp0

Cracked open a tin of Barbary Coast this morning, only had about a month of age on it so I expected it to be a bit raw still.

The tin note is a fantastic rush of brandy (topping) along with some ethanol heat and, wait for it.... Flintstones vitamins.  If you have ever had them you know what I'm talking about, its the most distinct taste ever and I can almost feel that odd grit from the chewables!  It also was reminiscent of The Virginia Cream as well.

The cut is cubed with small pieces of burley leaf.  Very wet, microwave this one or let it sit out for a while.  I'm in TN so it's never dry here, my basement is 51% humidity as I type so I microwave everything otherwise I'll be waiting forever to smoke!

First light is a blast of brandy followed by smooth burley, really good burley - mellow, nutty, earthy, and... chocolate?  Also some greasey steak that I'm guessing is from a white burley.  It almost comes on as a smoky bacon taste too, ugh, more white burley, please!

  If you have not had the pleasure of tasting a greasy burley then you must get a hold of some MacBaren Norwood (if you can find it), its the best example ever - think of the incense notes in Penzance mixed with a perfectly cooked medium ribeye. Nom nom nom nom...

Um anyway, back to the bowl.  The perique gives a solid heat punch to my nostrils on the retrohale while the brandy still hangs around and softens everything out.  The perique is the typical C&D granulated taste - musty, mushrooms, and woodsy with almost a velvet like heat, quite the opposite of H&H with its dark fruit and chocolate.

  I'm smoking this in my Grabow Westbrook skate, the first pipe my wife got me for Christmas a few years ago that started me down this rabbit hole of PAD/TAD and it's an awesome little pipe but a bitch to keep lit because of its small size and shape so the relights are a'plenty.

There's red virginia in this blend and it's helping to bring a sweet tooth as everything comes together. I love how red VA can bring a blend together and bring a doughnut like taste to a blend, its not a strong taste by any means but once you identify it you appreciate the balance it offers by not letting the condimentals take center stage.  This is starting to remind me of McClelland's Tudor Castle - I swear that blend is spicy dry velvet in leaf form.  

Nicotine? Of course, its a C&D for Christmas' sake!  Might as well bring on a cup of coffee so I can get all the shakes this morning!  My custom (leftover bags) mix of French Roast and Tanzanian Peaberry brings the burley back to the front and gives off a caramel sweetness to the blend that reminds me of why coffee and burley is the breakfast of champions.  A great start to my morning before I go spend the rest of my day in grocery store hell the weekend of Christmas...  

Guys, if you do venture out to any grocery/retail/restaurants over the next few days be extra nice to the staff, working this time of year sucks so much ass and  most of us have to forego any holiday time with families, so excuse us if we aren't in the jolliest of moods.

As the bowl progresses to its final third I am sufficiently nicotine/caffeine addled and I think this overview echoes that.  Here we have a blend that warrants further exploration as a proper review is necessary but for now I will state that this is a blend I find perfect for the holidays in its fruit cake taste and spice.  You've got brandy, molasses, choclolate, caramel, sweet breads, its quite a melange of flavors that I wish I could put more time into but unfortunately I'll be late for work as it is!

Colors tasted while smoking are purple, white, red, and dark brown.

Nicotine is full but it won't knock St. Nick down the chimney.
====================================
Zenith251: I recently cracked open a 3yo tin of this. With age, the perique and brandy mellow out. The Virginia's stay present but tame, less like Montgomery, probably because of the burley.

I think with age this becomes a more mild, lightly complex burley-brandy blend. I feel like 3 years is too long for this blend compared to other aged C&Ds ive cracked.

misterzipp0: I can see that being he case as its well put together, I think 6-12 months would really solidify it but it's ready to go as is.
--
Zenith251: That's how I feel about a favorite of mine, Piccadilly. 1 year, but not more than 2 years. I've gone through enough to discern the finer details of it. 
--
misterzipp0: Not familiar with that one, what's in it?
--
Zenith251: I'll just quote the tin from TobaccoReviews: "Picadilly is a provocative blend of several Virginia tobaccos, delicately spiced with Latakia, and finished with Louisiana perique. ... ... A perfect "English Breakfast Mixture.""

It's just plain not good under a year, give or take a month or two. The flavors fall flat, or at least muddled and unclear under that. The Latakia and Perique are really quite subtle in this blend. When it was first introduced to me, by a senior pipe smoker, I didn't call out either at first. I just said "It tastes like virginias and.... something else."

BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Sounds good.  I'll add it to my wishlist.  Thanks for the review.
