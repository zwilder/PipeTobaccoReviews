Review #24 Dueling review with /u/pixeechick

Cue the banjo music.

**Blend Name:** Chieftain’s Islay Mixture

**Description on Tin:** Strong, full bodied, spicy - these are the main characteristics to describe this tobacco. Here we combine the classic taste of past times with today's art of sophisticated blending, the result being a pure delight for experienced smokers. The blend is based on a complex Ready Rubbed formula bringing together the finest Virginia, Kentucky, Burley and Black Cavendish. The full body of this tobacco is then enhanced by just a hint of Perique. The final mixture is then fermented for months in original Chieftain's Caol Ila Islay barrels a process that brings a wonderful smoky taste to the tobacco.
 
**Leaf:** Rather uniform medium brown, roughly 1 inch long, thin ribbons. Moist to the touch, but dries very rapidly once set out.

**Tin Aroma:** Quite funky – smoky, sweet, coconut, mushrooms, seawater, rootbeer, vomit

**Taste:** Spicy. Not quite like Perique, dark fired, or orientals. Hard to place, it is complex. Again, like the tin note, it is funky, but not as alarming. There is a boozey note, but I wouldn’t think to call it whisky if that weren’t smacked on the label. Oh now it is coming, first with the medicinal notes, iodine, antiseptic. Chocolate somewhere in there. A little patience and… oak, honey, light sweetness – bourbon barrel. Hot mustard, both the taste and the burn. A little of the natural tobacco shows its character, a bit of Virginia sugartooth, a touch of nuttiness. Woodsmoke. Has a nature that it needs to be smoked on a night like this, icy and unkempt, moon hunched tired over the sky. Quality Virginia that, with depth, tanginess. Alternating with the occasional mouthful of peat-bog. Sulfur and smoke.

The bite was a bit too much, so I finished the bowl the next day:

It is much more mellow now. It really does seem like the tobacco is speaking now – a little bit of Virginia sweetness, nuttiness and chocolate notes that I would expect from Burley or Cavendish. The spicy undertone is still present, still unlike anything I am used to experiencing. The whisky flavor itself does not seem to be present, but the odd puff will show the peaty elements, sulphur and iodine, a hint of wood smoke. Edges at bitterness here. The tobaccos are very well married, and with that touch of smoke, makes it quite like an English blend. At the end the whisky does come back, sweet and honey, and a little peat lingering on my tongue once I put the pipe down.

**Smokability:** Quite pleasant to handle and pack, amenable to any manner of packing, but I think the Frank is my preferred mode for any ribbon that can handle it. Dry enough to light easily and cherries well. But it will bite you. Every time. Not the tongue, but that back of the mouth chemical burn, like fresh Anniversary Kake. This tin was packed September 2008, so it is not a matter of aging, so it must be something with this particular mixture, or the whisky it absorbs. 

On the second night, the bite moved to my tongue. Even sipping this thing is dangerous.

**Room Note:** Mellow, nutty, a bit syrupy and smoky.

**Thoughts:** This is a tobacco blend with wonderful intentions. Execution, well, no, not quite. The whisky notes are there, plentiful, discernable, and fun to experience – both the sweeter side and the funkiness of a proper Islay. However the tendency to bite ruins the whole experience. I am not particularly prone to bite, and usually can ignore it when I do get a touch of it. Not this time. I am going to have to take a day or two away from my pipe after this. After writing the review I found out the base is sometimes said to be an English blend (I don’t like to peek beforehand) which explains why it tastes like one – and perhaps the strange spiciness, due to the oriental or Turkish reportedly in the blend. Though some sources say it has Perique and Dark Fired in it. The information on this blend is scarce, and frequently contradictory. 

I would like this tobacco, if I could smoke it without harming myself, but I think I will bung the tin up and see if another 6 years will tame its anger.

**Summary:** Kitchen sink blend with Islay whisky notes with a 195-proof burn.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**+/-

Rating system (interpreted through the world of Scotch Whisky):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Talisker 10)

(++++) Great (The Macallan Cask Strenth)

(+++) Very good (Laphroiag 10 – Cask Strength – Quarter Cask)

(++) Good (Cragganmore 12)

(+) I think like it (Teacher’s Highland Cream)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Johnny Walker Black)

(--)This is not for me (The Famous Grouse)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (McClleand’s Highland)

(----)This is suffering (Johnny Walker Red)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Rogue Oregon Single Malt)

Thanks again to /u/pixeechick for finding this limited run tobacco and shipping this halfway around the world.

====================================
levins0: Talisker over Laphroaig and black over blue? Hmm...a most curious rating system indeed! :)

antiwittgenstein: I prefer complexity in all things. Laphroaig has a singular punch of flavor, which while fantastic, is not exciting to me as the depth and breadth I get from Talisker. As for JW, the black is palatable, but somehow worse than its constituent parts. The blue tastes like meh, like compromise and water, it is the whisky equivalent of later day Simpsons - great elements reduced to well branded monotony based on the assumption that is what people desire. It is a fine whisky if it were $30 a bottle, but I find even the Glennfiddich 12 to have more spark to it for a cool $180 less.
--
levins0: The blue is definitely overpriced, but I find it smoother than the black. 

It's interesting on the Talisker vs Laphroaig. I like them both, but I have exactly the opposite opinion. For me, Talisker is all smoke, which I like sometimes, while the Laphroaig is crazy complex. 

Ah well. The great maker loves infinite diversity. Cheers!

====================================
TBSA60: Aromas of vomit? Blech that does not sound nice at all lol. Sounds like a tobacco that maybe needed a little more work before being released? 

Thanks for the review, the dueling idea is pretty neat, would really like to see more of these.  
--
antiwittgenstein: It was pretty gnarly, but that is Islay whisky. The tin was dated from 2008. There is just something in there, in the topping or the tobacco that eats up the tongue.

I am glad you liked it, it was fun to put together and /u/pixeechick and are already plotting do some more in the future, but it would be cool if this could be a regular thing we see in the sub. When trades are made, mostly likely you are going to have 2 members with the same tobacco - that is a prime opportunity for a double review.
--
pixeechick: I think it would be great if more people did this when they traded. I'll start suggesting it to people with whom I trade. /u/TBSA60 - Are you interested? 
--
TBSA60: Sure I am down for it, I am not much of a writer but I will do my best :)
--
pixeechick: Excellent! Looking forward to it!
--
====================================
pixeechick: I don't know how on earth you got all of that flavor out of this blend before it flayed your tongue into sizzling ribbons. I have, like you, jarred this up for an extended "time out" in the back corner of my cellar. We'll see if it's any better behaved as a teenager than as a second-grader. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Considering my earlier run ins with this I was surprised myself that I was able to extract so much flavor from it before my tongue was toast. It might have been a fluke, but I am not going to repeat the experiment any time soon.
