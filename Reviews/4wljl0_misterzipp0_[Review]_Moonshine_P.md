[Review] Moonshine Pipes Devil Dog

====================================
misterzipp0: Took advantage of the BOGO moonshine pipe sale the other day and I received my devil dog so I wanted to post an honest review in case anyone was considering the same piece.


I purchased a Moonshine triple distilled poker at the Nashville show last year and have been very happy with it so I figured it was time for another one from Moonshine.

I will be the first to admit that I would not consider myself a pipe snob or very well-versed on what makes an amazing pipe 'amazing'.  I purchase most of my pipes based on looks and price and I tend to gravitate more towards rhodesian and author shapes so I purchased the 320 author in whiskey blast finish and the devil dog in the apple pie finish.

To be honest I was having a pretty hard time figuring out what the apple pie finish actually was. I tried on mobile and on my laptop and whenever I would select the finish in the drop-down box a picture with multiple pipes would appear. This made it pretty difficult to figure out because the finish across different pipe shapes never looked the same. I thought the finish I was getting would be a little more contrasted, with deep red and brown colors but it's a lighter like a dark maple. I'm not unhappy with the color but I'm not in love with it as much as the examples of apple pie that I saw on the website.  The burnt sienna color theme  along with the aluminum band is a great combo and calling it an apple pie is great marketing in keeping with the moonshine name.

In keeping with the light theme the detailing on the acrylic stem is very subtle. You have to bring it out into bright natural daylight to see the contrast. I used the flashlight on my phone to illustrate this.  Compared to the author that I received it is a pretty striking difference between the two. I realize that not all pieces are created equally and this is still considered a value line so that certainly comes into play.

There are a few fills on this piece and one of them is a larger one that has a pretty interesting snowman shape (to me). Again, considering this is a value line I will take it, I have seen much worse.

The pipe is considerably smaller than what I thought but honestly that is not bad. I tend to smoke while I'm driving (I spend a lot of time in the car with my job) so something smaller was actually a good thing.  I am concerned that I'm going to char up the rim because compared to the opening it has a relatively deep bowl but that is on me and my skills.

The pipe smokes well and since it is so small, light, and short I don't have a problem lipping it.  I would not consider myself a clencher as I don't use my teeth but I tend to hold it between my lips pretty strongly and it's not nearly as heavy as some others so that's a plus.

I am going to have to spend some time figuring out what type of tobacco pairs well with this shape because I smoked two different blends so far and I'm having trouble pulling much flavor out of it.  That could be because it's not broken in or my tasters are off but so far I've smoked The Virginia Cream, and Stroll on Main (BurPer) and the usual flavors I can pull out of both of those blends are not there.  This could be me or the pipe just needs some time being broken in so I will run some small flakes through it and see how it does.

The biggest gripe I have with this is that the finish is not quite what I expected. I suppose this is the issue you run into when you are not seeing the specific pipe you are purchasing.  I know that common practice is to put the best examples of a pipe up on the website but the difference in finishes is so strong that it makes me question if they shouldn't just put single pipes in each picture or maybe group a couple different apple pie finishes together so the purchaser will know what that finish actually is.

Overall I'm happy with the pipe and once I figure out the best tobacco pairing I can see this getting quite a bit of windshield time with me.

Jman2321: Nice birds eye but I agree not quite the coloring I would have expected based off of the stock photos.

PhysicsNovice: It smokes Va well. His approach to advertising is similar to the food industry. Has anyone here revived a pipe from him where the finish matched expectations (besides black rustication)?

The finish of the whiskey blast was pretty spot on to what is advertised. The kitchen lighting sucks versus the stock photo but I feel that is pretty accurate to what what is displayed.

I did a quick side-by-side of the same acrylic, it's a big difference.

====================================
None: I like it's classic color, very old school, but can see what you mean, doesn't appear to have had any black dye applied or it did and none of it took, for a smooth at that price point I'd say you did well fill wise, one big fill for all that bird's eye, it definitely could have been worse. I too was shocked by the size, chamber size is pretty standard all across the board though. As for the acrylic it's pretty much a crap shoot.
