Dan Tobacco Patriot Flake Review
By: SMIDSY
---
As per my pledge to do so, here is my review of my favorite VA blend and my first tobacco review ever.


Blend contents: Virginia (Smokingpipes.com also says it has Orientals) with no noticeable topping

Cut: flake (obviously)

Tin note: bread and tea


Room (car) note: bread and "tobacco"



Moisture from tin: just right, maybe 15min of drying time if you want. Smokes just fine strait out of the tin.


Flavor: medium/full but leaning to medium (for a VA)


Nicotine level: respectable but not dangerous


Pipe I smoked it out of today: Peterson System XL315


Some months ago, my tobacconist recommended this "tasty" blend when I told him I was trying to get into Virginias. The first bowl I smoked was just fantastic.

I am very ADD when it comes to blends and almost never smoke the same one twice in a row. But this stuff, just damn. I find myself lingering until the very bottom of the bowl to get every last strip of that bready goodness in my mouth. It is one of only a couple blends I will smoke twice in a row and would be on my list of tobaccos to take with me to a desert island or visiting a country where tobacco is horrendously expensive.


The taste is that of rich tobacco and bread with a hint of spice in the background. Similar to the spice level one gets form a little pepper on their food. Speaking of food, the smoke tastes good enough to make me actually hungry. The flavor also stays pretty consistent through the bowl, even after resting the pipe for a little bit.

The tobacco is also very well behaved, especially for a VA flake. It is very forgiving with temperature and will keep its taste even if I am puffing a bit too fast. As someone who started with English blends, this is very helpful. It stays lit pretty easily and the thin flakes are no trouble to rub out.


The nicotine level is pretty much perfect for me. After about 15 minutes I get that nice chesty relaxation. But it never gets to the point where I am uncomfortable and NEED to stop. In deep bowls, however, I find that I set it down halfway through the bowl due to being genuinely satisfied.


If I had to sum this up in a quick blurb it would be "idiot-proof Virginia blend". If you like bready VAs, you owe it to yourself to try this. Couple bucks more than the average 50g tin, but well worth it.


My background:

Long history with tobacco and nicotine in general, smoking a pipe for nearly 2 years.

Generally gravitate to user friendly full flavored blends.

brainskan13: Nice! That sounds right up my alley. I think the only Dan Tobacco blend I have tried was Blue Note (which I liked but haven't repurchased). I keep meaning to check out more of their products.

SMIDSY: This is the only Dan Tobacco blend I have tried so far, so I can't say anything in regards to their other blends. But this is very tasty stuff and I highly recommend it.

misterzipp0: Nice review! I like it when orientals add a little pepper to Va's subtle spice.
--
SMIDSY: It really does have the perfect amount of spice to it. A very well engineered blend, as one would expect from a German company.
