Blend Name: G.L. Pease: Haddo's Delight 

Description on Tin: Haddo's Delight is a stout blend of several Virginia tobaccos with a generous measure of long-cut Perique. Unflavored Black Cavendish and a little air-cured White Burley ribbon provide fullness, body, and a bit of extra strength. Finally, an exclusive process darkens and marries the mixture, and gives the blend a subtle tin aroma of cocoa and dried fruit. The flavor is full on the palate, earthy, slightly sweet and intriguingly piquant, with overtones of figs and raisins. A wonderful G. L. Pease blend for the Perique lover

Leaf: Ribbon cut with Black Cavendish, Burley, Perique, and Virginia. Not a real Burley contender, its just there. A decent amount of Perique and Cavendish with the Virginia carrying out the rest.

Tin Aroma:  A scent of plums and fermented Perique. You can almost pick up the earth/nut tones of the Burley if you shove you face in it. Just as the leafs mixture this is all carried over the familiar scent of ripe Virginia

Taste: A really smooth flavor of Virginia and Perique, with the afterthought of Burley. If you want to bring the Burley out more smoke this with a cup of coffee. The Cavendish seems to disappear leaving only a slight creamyness that assists the Virginia in making a really fullfilling smoke.

Smokability: Needs a little drying time but soon after you can ease into your smoking. I typically smoke ribbons with the spiral method this was no different. I heard about plum addition but hadn't expected it to complement the Perique so well. Of course with Burley and Cavendish you have the base for a slow smoking blend, so no surprise you get to enjoy the flavors for a good while.

Room Note: Plum with the cool smoke provided by Cavendish. Hints of nut and earth from the Burley and a really slight sweetness that's buried in the plum scents that I suspect come from the Virginia's.

Thoughts: This blend really surprised me, I really do not care for Cavendish at all. In fact if I see Cavendish as listed in a blend I typically scratch it from the list without a second thought. I prefer the flavors provided by other leafs that could occupy that space in a blend. 
That being said I will be getting more of Haddo's Delight. In this blend the Cavendish carries the plum through and that is what makes it all come together. And the back notes of Burley more than make up for it in the flavor department.

Recommend to: People who like a darker earthier Va-Per style blend. Although if you don't enjoy a heady room note of plum that might end it for you. Also if you wanted a blend that had a Burley taste without the full delivery of Burley Vitamin N, this is for you.

Summary: A really well constructed blend by G.L. Pease. But its also one of those blends that the addition of one aspect could ruin it for you: Plum. For me it really brought it all together and made this blend stand out as more than just another Va-Per, but if you want a fuller flavor this might not cut it for some.

My Background: This is the first review of five I plan to do with the Baccy provided by u/bonehed. 3 years smoking a pipe, a few more smoking cigars and a previous nail smoker. I have enjoyed this blend from a cob, briar, and clay.

CaptainDickPuncher: Great review! This is probably going to be on the list for my next order.

Sku77s: I try. It's definitely worth a shot at least once to have such an odd perique blend.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Mine was from sample and didn't really get the plum - it was pretty dry. I thought it was good but incoherent - I wonder if that plum topping was what was holding it altogether. 

I'm excited for this stretch. If I send you tobacco will you promise to review it too?

Sku77s: The plum note really what brought this blend together and made it worth smoking. I almost treated it like an aro, smoking it just ever so slightly damper than most and being super careful of potential biteyness. Well worth the effort to enjoy such odd bedfellows.

I threw a humidisk in with my sample to keep it fresh and it paid off.

How can I say no to free samples? Though at some point I need to trade officially to get my "+"
