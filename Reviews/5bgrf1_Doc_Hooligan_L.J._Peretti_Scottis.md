L.J. Peretti Scottish Flake Review (kind of a long read, but there's a lot going on with this one).
By: Doc_Hooligan

**Description** (from their [website](http://www.ljperetti.com/l-j-peretti-tobacco-cat/flake.html)): "Our fullest bodied flake. A blend of mature Virginias is cured with red wine and pressed into a cake and subsequently steam treated. The result is a jet-black cake with delivers loads of thick, rich smoke."

**Cut**: broken flake

**Pouch note**: slightly fruity and sour

**Pipe**: Peterson Silver Spigot XL025

**Drink pairing** (because why not?): plain hot tea (PG Tips, to be exact)

**Prep**: coarsely rubbed out

**Loading**: swirl method

**Dry time**: 10 minutes

**The Smoke**: Char light was a little difficult at first. Didn't seem to want to take the flame, but eventually got it started. After a brief rest and a tamp, it lit right up and once I got it going, I got hit with a big dose of Virginia goodness. Even though the flakes are as black as midnight, this has some really bright flavors. Sweet and grassy with just enough of a sour note from the wine to make it really interesting. Loads of thick smoke right from the get-go. Lightly floral and honey notes on retrohale. This pipe has a big bowl on it, so I'm settling in for a nice, long session. If it keeps up like this, it should be a very pleasant one at that. 

1/4 of the way in and it's still full of bright Virginia hay-like flavor, although there's a definite dark fruit undertone. Comes together in a beautiful harmony with an amazingly creamy and rich smoke. Even just puffing lightly will still yield thick clouds. Smoking outside, I can't say much about a room note, but a whiff of the bowl as it's burning smells like fresh-baked bread. 

About halfway in, started to get a little bit of a spice note, not entirely unlike Perique (although I'm pretty sure there's no Perique in it). The prevailing grassy sweetness has subsided a little, although it's definitely still there. Flavors have turned a bit more earthy, but still with a noticeable sweetness. The flavor from the wine is still present, though it has also mellowed a bit. I catch myself getting a touch aggressive, but I can't help it. This stuff is good! Have to remind myself to slow down for now. It hasn't bitten me, but I'm only halfway in. 

Starting to get a nice mix of sweet and savory flavors. Rich, buttery, and slightly sweet almost like an egg custard or buttery popcorn, but still with a very faint fruity undertone. 

I was never much of a wine drinker, but I understand about pairings. My choice of beverage was perfect for this smoke. The astringency from the tea makes it an excellent palate cleanser, allowing me to pick up previously unnoticed flavors. There's a lighter fruit flavor emerging, almost like dried peaches or apricots. Very subtle, but it's there. 

2/3 in and just had my first relight. Still getting a lot of good flavor, and the relight went nice and quick. A quick kiss of the flame and we're back in business with a lot of thick, rich smoke. 

Now we're coming close to the end. Relights are becoming more frequent and more difficult. Flavors are definitely turning more earthy. Less floral and grassy and more like autumn leaves. Still sweet, but a different kind of sweetness. Kind of like the difference between Canadian whisky and Scotch. 

Finished up with mostly fine ash and very little dottle. 

**Overall**: this is an absolutely incredible tobacco that is everything I want from a Virginia. Lots of complex flavors, nothing cloying or overpowering, lots of thick smoke, and no bite. I regret only buying an ounce of it now, but I will quickly rectify that. This one could easily become my go-to smoke, although I'll need to have a few more bowls to make sure this wasn't a one-time fluke. I'd give this a solid four out of four stars. 

====================================
GanDuff: Awesome review, and it sounds like a delicious tobacco. I got some recently when L.J. Peretti ran the sale on flakes. Looking forward to trying Scottish Flake and No. 8 Slice out.
--
Doc_Hooligan: I haven't had the No. 8 slices, but just going by how much I enjoyed the Scottish Flake, I'm looking forward to trying more of their products. I bought a cake of Thanksgiving Day, and as soon as I pick up some more jars (or empty out a few), I'll be giving that one a go. When I order more Scottish Flake, I'll have to pick up some of the No. 8 slices as well. I'm interested in hearing others' opinions on the Scottish Flake, so please let me know what you think of it when you get around to trying it out.

====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Great write up. Next time I order from LJ I'll pick up a tin.

====================================
luthiermark: I have a few 8 oz tins of their Scottish Flake, and it's not just one of my favorite blends from Perettis, but one of my favorite virginia flakes, period. My understanding is that it's made for them by McClelland, and to my palette it's very similar to, and possibly a crossover between, Black Star and Navy Cavendish. It's definitely a fickle smoke, and takes some trial and error to find the proper amount of drying time before lighting, but the reward is unquestionably worth it.
--
Doc_Hooligan: I can see it being McClelland Virginias. I haven't had a bad smoke from any of their Virginia tobaccos. I haven't tried Dark Star, so I might have to pick some up and give it a go. I'm with you as far as it being a favorite. Granted, I have only had one bowl of it so far, but It was a very pleasant experience, which I hope to revisit soon. When you say it's "fickle", what exactly do you mean? The only thing I can think of that would fit that description was just how difficult it was to get started. Once I got it going, it was delightful.
--
luthiermark: That's precisely what I mean. Dark Star is notoriously one of the most difficult flakes to light properly, especially for novice smokers. It has its own learning curve apart from most other flakes. Scottish Flake, being a close cousin to Dark Star, has the same learning curve. I usually put a pinch on a paper towel and let it air dry for 20 or 30 minutes, then, once stuffed in the bowl, give it another 10 to 20 minutes or so of drying time before attempting to light it. I've gone as long as 2 to 3 hours drying time with it, and still had it be an enjoyable smoke. Longer than 8 hours though, (packing the bowl overnight to enjoy in the morning, for instance), and you start to lose some of the red wine sweetness. It's still a good bowl of tobacco at that point, but not as good as it could/should be.

====================================
ChemEng: I can't believe you only dried it for 10 minutes and had that good a response from it. 10 mins of drying this blend for me usually means I have to get the blow torch out to get it started.

But it is super tasty stuff. No denying that...
--
Doc_Hooligan: I only ordered one ounce, which came in a ziploc bag, so it probably had a bit of drying before it even got to me. I'm sure if I ordered a tin it would've needed more dry time.

====================================
notmynamebutreally: Thanks for the review! I guess I should get out of No. 8 and Thanksgiving Day for a while ;)
--
====================================
majkeli: I grabbed an ounce of this when I ordered Thanksgiving Day.  I haven't tried it yet but I'm really looking forward to it now!  It really smells great.
--
Doc_Hooligan: I'm kicking myself for only picking up an ounce. I had a feeling I would like it, but I figured it was best to play it safe and order a little bit in case I didn't like it. Now I want to load up and stockpile it. It's excellent as it is, so I can only imagine what it will be like with a few years on it.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Really solid review mate. I still have yet to dig into Peretti's blends but you make a strong case to start now.
