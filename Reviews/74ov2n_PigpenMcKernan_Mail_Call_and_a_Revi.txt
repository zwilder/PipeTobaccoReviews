Mail Call and a Review

[Some stuff](https://imgur.com/gallery/dpThH) came in from pipes and cigars today. I recently tried the La Unica made by Fuente so took advantage of a promo to grab two of the new boxes. I added a tin of Elizabethan because why should I pay for shipping when I could get some tobacco instead for the same price?  Anyways, they threw in these half pipe cigars which are supposedly hand rolled with Dominican wrapper and binder and a 50/50 mix of Dominican and black Cavendish as the filler. Boy are these things sweet, although the name Sweet Ride should have been a clue to me. Overall it wasn't bad, just not my thing. I'll probably save them for friends who are interested if not a little bit intimidated by cigars or pipes. I have a feeling my lady would like them.
