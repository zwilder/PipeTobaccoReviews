Orlik - Dark Strong Kentucky: A small review.

====================================
SickWillie: In preparation for the upcoming Mystery Tobacco Review I’ve been working on my note taking while smoking, and decided to write a little review of a tobacco I don’t see mentioned much.

Orlik - Dark Strong Kentucky

**Description from SP:** This Orlik number takes a mix of select Virginias and combines it with, as the name implies, dark-fired Kentucky, to create a flake that provides a fine contrast between the bright and dark flavors of these tobaccos.

**Tin aroma:** First, these flakes are beautiful. The dark fired Kentucky sandwiches some golden  looking Virginias, almost looks good enough to eat. The tin smell reminded me of barbecue sauce, kinda. Sweet, smoky. 

**Pack and light:** Typical flake, went with the trusty fold and stuff - didn’t want to mess with the ratios of DFK to VA. My Nording freehand has a pretty deep bowl, and the flakes are relatively small - so I folded and stuffed one and then folded and stuffed another on top. Rubbed out a flake to place a bit on top, flakes rub out easily and cleanly. The tobacco is a bit moist out of the tin.

**The smoke:** Holy heck. First little bit was a nice tasting, pretty mild Virginia. Almost citrusy but not quite, almost grassy. Before I could really focus on it I got hit with a nice satisfying molasses flavor. As the smoke progressed the molasses flavor turned more into a sweet, brown sugar-esque flavor that dominated everything else. Very satisfying, very smooth. The first smoke right out the tin was a little hot and steamy. The next smoke I let dry a bit before smoking which fixed the problem. Both stayed lit fairly easily. Very pleasant room note, good beard note. 

**Final thoughts:** I bought this on a whim when P&C had those sweet mega deals over the holidays. Purchased a few tins, because what the heck. Super glad I did. Honestly, this will probably be a regular smoke. Pairs well with coffee in the morning. Smokes well during an afternoon break. Tastes great after dinner. The tins I have are all from 2017, and I imagine with a bit of age this will really take off. 

4/5 - will definitely order again.

stogie-bear: I love this, and its cousin Heinrichs Dark Strong Flake. When there was 20%+20% off for IPSD I stocked up.
--
AuRelativity: I'm just going to leave the shopping to you guys and buy on /ptm/. killer deal-hunting skills
--
SickWillie: Heck, I wish I ordered more. Couldn’t beat those prices! Definitely going to have to check out that Heinrichs Dark Strong Flake now...
--
stogie-bear: It’s... almost the same thing but in giant tins :)
--
====================================
HavelDad: This stuff really is presented beautifully, I need to throw this in my car with a cob. I smoked a few bowls and stored it away. 
--
SickWillie: You should! How long have you let it sit? 
--
HavelDad: Only about a month. Picked it up the start of last month like you did for the whopping 5$ and change
--
====================================
Chemical_Lab: I have perhaps 8 tins of this and never opened a single one.  Love that presentation- your photograph makes my mouth water.

All credit to you for encouraging me to open one up and try it out.  Thanks!
--
SickWillie: Thanks! Ha, I really was tempted to eat it... let me know what you think of it when you try it! Negative online reviews complained of a licorice/anise taste - but I couldn’t find that anywhere in the bowls I’ve had. Tried it out of my Nording Freehand, a MM Legend, and a Savinelli bent billiard.
--
====================================
TheDeadProphet: That is a beautiful stripe!
--
SickWillie: Ha! The review was really just an excuse to show off how pretty this tobacco is! 
--
====================================
analogy_4_anything: Hmm, I have a tin I purchased from my B&M, just took a look and realized it’s from 2015. I think I will enjoy some of that later tonight. I won’t know how it compares but maybe I can try to give some insight as to what I taste from the extra couple years of aging.
--
SickWillie: Awesome! I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
--
analogy_4_anything: Oh man, so good.

So I got to light up this afternoon after letting it dry for some time. The tin note was wonderful but this smoke is so sweet it’s almost like a desert. It almost tastes like a smoked maple syrup with notes of dark fruit and a little bit of spice on the end. The first pull on the draw was really strong, almost off putting. But once the tobacco got going it mellowed out into this wonderful smooth taste. I would love to see how this compares to a newer tin but I can say that an extra couple years of aging have done nothing to hurt it. 
--
SickWillie: Awesome!! Thanks for the update! That sounds incredible. Now I gotta go put these tins somewhere I won’t see them for a couple years...
--
====================================
AWoodPiddler: Loved the flavor of this tobacco but I could not get it to stay lit. 

--
SickWillie: Well, I live in like the driest part of a dry state (AZ) - so maybe that helps? I also found that when I fold and stuff flakes that I stuff them WAY more loose than I feel like I should. The rubbed out bits on top of the stuffed flake helps too. 
--
====================================
1atomicsquid: I always have trouble keeping DSK lit. But I still really enjoy it
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice write up. Makes me put this higher on my try next list.

Any smokes you can compare this too?
--
SickWillie: Thank you! Well, I’m not the most well versed pipe tobacco guy - but I think the satisfying tobacco flavors in DSK are what Orlik Golden Sliced wants to be... like if you added the cooked fruit (?) flavors of a VA/Perique tobacco without the spice of the perique.... then threw some brown sugar in there on top. 

Ha, I’m currently smoking yet another bowl of this while I try and describe the flavors and come up with a comparison... hopefully it makes sense!
--
====================================
piping_presbyter: You have convinced me to crack open a tin. Thanks
--
SickWillie: Can’t wait to hear what you think of it! 
--
piping_presbyter: I enjoyed it very much. In fact, considerably more than Darkstar, which I had this morning.
--
SickWillie: Wow thats some high praise! Dark Star was on my list of tobaccos to try eventually (“McClelland isn’t going to spontaneously disappear” - past me, that jerk).

Thanks for the update!
