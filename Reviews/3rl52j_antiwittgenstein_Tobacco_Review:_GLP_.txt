Tobacco Review: GLP Virginia Cream
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #54

**Blend Name:** GLP Virginia Cream

**Description on Tin:** Distinctively delicious! We season fine red and golden fine-cured Virginia tobaccos with rare condimental leaf enhancing the result with a sublte vanilla/bourbon topping that is never overbearing. Rare for a blend of its genre, Virginia Cream delivers on its aromatic promise from first puff to the bottom of the bowl, while leaving the pipe clean and free of phantom flavors. An all-American blend ideal for Virginia fanciers craving something a little sweeter.
 
**Leaf:** Long and fluffly ribbon in yellow, beige, and brown.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Rich and sweet, let’s see… raisins, hazelnuts, morning pastries, chocolate croissants in particular, rootbeer
 
**Taste:** 

*Review 1:*

VaPer and Cream Vanilla Soda. A high keening spice running down the slopes with saber aloft. Soft burley with its roughened nutty edge. With a black pepper spark I would like to amend my first comment to Dark Fired and Vanilla Soda. With the earthy undertones it gives the impression of a rootbeer float. The vanilla fades back down. A touch of tangy sweetness from the Virginia, but this bowl seems more dominated by the Burley. Quite akin to Carter Hall – which is high praise from me. The brights then come forward, lemony in particular, but with a vague vinegar pucker. Wood smoke and rootbeer float again. Out and out A&W cream soda. Hazelnuts, breakfast pastries. I can see this being a great morning blend for you dawntime smokers. With a cup of tea or coffee? That would be a solid pairing. Or a creamy stout, though that is less of a morning brew for most of us. Slowing my cadence and taking gentle sips accentuates the Vanilla Cream, custardiness of this blend. Greedier smoking brings it back to the Virginia-Burley Carter Hall taste, though with a much more pronounced spice and smoky depth. The Vanilla is also easier to discern on the exhale. The Vanilla isn’t cheap or artificial, but tastes like Vanilla Bean, or really Vanilla Bean Ice Cream – I’ve never just sucked on a Vanilla Bean pod. Yet, I should say. 

*Review 2:*

Bright lemony Virginia. Smoky dark fired. A bit of funky bourbon on top of Virginias. Tastes much like a C&D product. Very peppery. Just the lightest touch of Vanilla. Rootbeer again in the exhale. Hay and oatmeal. No noticeable sweetness. It sizzles in the pipe sometime. Not gurgles, but the sound of vapors combusting. Loads of dark fired then some Virginia comes back. It is mostly dark fired with a hint of Virginia and the tiniest note of vanilla on the occasional exhale.

*Review 3:*

Sweet, like candy, Molto Dolce kind of sweet. Bread, hay, oatmeal. Breakfast time again. Growing spicier, the dark fired starts up, quickly growing to a heavy pepper. Sweet and spicy and a bit smoky. There is something cigar like about this experience. Much more uniform in this same vein – the vanilla has faded away, but it is still rather sweet. Perique. This is the first time the Perique has come out in front of the Dark Fired. Reminiscent of Billy Budd. And Haddo’s Delight. And a heavy maduro cigar like a Diesel or Punch Bareknuckle or a Padron. 

*Review 4:*

Dark fired and rootbeer. Except I am coming to recognize the malty sweetness as the bourbon topping – has a similar soft sweetness about the mouth as Frog Morton Cellar. Hay and oatmeal again – lightly malty. A happy mélange of sweet and spicy flavors. Virginia, again soft, with Perique and the dark fired. No, now the VA is hard – salt and vinegar – this is the boldest Virginia flavor I have had from a bowl of the cream yet. The vanilla is building – it is extremely strong on the exhale and finish. A strange mixture as you go from potato chips to wedding cake in the same breath. Burley and Virginia – again very much like 3 Friars and Carter Hall. Get more heavy into the Dark Fired. Then slowly the Bourbon comes back. Earthy and nutty. Again I am reminded of a darker cigar. 


**Nicotine:** Has some oomph to it. Not enough to knock me down or bring my dinner back up, but my vision dims and I feel wonderfully mellow. On an empty stomach, well watch out.

**Smokability:** Puffs up a bit at 1st light. Sometimes it needs a few relights. I have attempted various drying times from right out of the tin to leaving it out overnight with little variation of smoking performance. True to its word, it does not ghost.
 
**Room Note:** Toasty tobacco. This is obviously not an aromatic

**Thoughts:** So a little insight on the way I usually complete my reviews. I will smoke a blend until I know it – until it gives me a consistent performance that is, with no suprises, when I know the beginning, middle, and the end. Then I will pack a bowl and write out the notes as they come. Then one or two days later I will smoke another bowl or two, adding in flavors I might have not caught the first time, or subtracting tastes I only caught once. This time I obviously did not do that, but smoked several bowls over the course of three weeks and recorded the above impressions. There are always the same elements – vanilla, Virginia, dark fired, burley, bourbon, Perique, hay, oatmeal, rootbeer -, but the balance, the timing, the development is different every single bowl. Even correcting for drying times, using the same pipe, I get a much different experience. So I did not try to integrate my experiences into a amalgamated entity, but left them as their disparate smokes. Because if you buy a tin of this, you are going to get a wide variety of flavor combinations. I think this underscores the organic nature of the product – you grab a handful of leaves and each time you will get a slightly different ratio of the components which can swing the profile one way or the other. /u/chewsyourownadv noted the changeability of this blend in his [excellent review]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3q67md/review_glp_virginia_cream/), but attributed the change from pipe to pipe. But the first 3 of the mini-reviews I wrote were all from the same pipe, which I had reserved for this blend alone. Again, this tin is fresh off the line, opened the day it arrived on my door step. I wanted to review this in a timely manner, not only in deference to /u/hedonaut who provided the baccy, but also because many here are still curious about this new product. However, I will jar the rest of this and let it marry. I will try it again next spring and see if the flavors marry and settle down, which I do fully expect. When I do, I will post up another review if it has changed substantially.

**Similar Tobaccos:** GLP Haddo’s Delight, Savenilli Dublone D’oro, MM Country Gentleman, C&D 3 Friars, Carter Hall

**Summary:** A vacillatory and complex blend showing Vanilla, Bourbon, and Rootbeer notes on top of a powerful mixture of Virginia, Dark Fired, and a touch of Perique.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** N/A. All my experiences are positive, swinging anywhere from good to great (++ to ++++ for you long time listeners) but the needle is still in flux.

Thanks again to /u/hedonaut for the Vanilla Cream!
====================================
pixeechick: You'll have to have a soda scale for this one, if it ever settles enough for you. 

Wonderful insights; I think I'll avoid this one for the time being if you're having Haddo-like moments out of it. Still, my predilection for A&W beverages tempts me...
--
antiwittgenstein: It is much more Dark Fired than Perique, but yes, it was surprisingly peppery.

And that soda scale idea is brilliant!
--
crimsonrat: The Haddo's part actually makes me want to try it, but I abhor root beer.
--
pixeechick: Well, it's got a lovely peppery start and it keeps peeking out from time to time. The pepperiness is something I associate with a good root beer, so ymmv. I think it's worth a shot.
--
crimsonrat: I was really, REALLY underwhelmed with it. It's like a modern day CH or something to me. 
--
pixeechick: That's unfortunate. Glad you got to try it, though!

chewsyourownadv: > I will try it again next spring and see if the flavors marry and settle down, which I do fully expect.

That is what I've come to believe will produce a consistent smoke as well. I noted in my review that there were a few crumbled leaves in the mixture; I'd wager those chunks of tobacco were Kentucky or perique. If so, an extra chunk in one bowl, or one fewer chunk in another bowl, that could make for a pretty different smoke. This would explain your variability between bowls, also explain the "here again, gone again" experience I had, as I tend to distribute the identifiable bit of tobacco evenly per bowl. Your suggestion is spot on; it needs a to sit a while in the tin, if you want consistency.

Very nice review, for a finicky, but good blend.

SupraMario: Really want to get some of this stuff may have to order a few tins with it.

====================================
Darwin7848: So far I've vacillated in only one direction, the negative one. Either it isn't my cup of tea or it really really does need to spend some time alone with its thoughts.  I'll check back in a few months.

====================================
annoyingbeggar: I think what you're picking up as root beer I found to be a sort of anise flavor. It was the only thing that felt out of place in the smoke to me.
