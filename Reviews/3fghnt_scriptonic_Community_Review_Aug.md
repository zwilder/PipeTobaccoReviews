boomer56: Blend Name: Old Gowrie

Description on Tin: “Rich red Virginia Flake, Ready Rubbed”
Leaf: Broken flake in long strands that tend to tangle either in shipping or nanoseconds after the tin is opened.	

Tin Aroma: Sweet and tangy. Yeast, figs, ketchup, soy sauce.

Taste: The flavor starts out rather thin, and for me there is a brief moment where I wonder if I’ve done something horribly wrong. Sweetness emerges first, but the other flavors soon rein it in, and the balance remains consistent almost to the end of the bowl. The flavor combination of this blend is what I would expect to get if I could cut up my childhood baseball mitt and smoke it. The predominant note is a leathery one, so strong it is almost a texture. But the fainter notes are what really make the blend- notes of spice and sour, the taste of cut grass drying, that round out the VaKen base. The taste is plain in the best possible way.  

Smokability: Rather moist in the tin, the consistency reminds me of Big League Chew. It needs to dry out, but not as much as one might think, or the ‘high notes’ of the flavor will disappear. The blend wants to burn at a balanced medium pace, and rewards that with a rich billowing smoke for a Va. The strength is my working definition of medium, and would easily permit this to be smoked all day. 

Room Note: Although in fairness this is a ‘front porch’ note for me, this blend is the archetype of ‘plain tobacco.’

Thoughts: Technically speaking, this is a very good blend that one could smoke all day were one so inclined. I tend to think of it as a palate cleanser from more assertive stuff. Plain ol water best preserves the nuances of this blend, although both coffee and green tea will alter its complexion. The tea was interesting. This is the ‘plain tobacco’ equivalent of driving in a luxury sedan. All the bumps and rough edges disappear, fast turns or late brakes are seamlessly compensated for, and everything is just smooth and pleasant. 

Recommend to: Someone interested in VA flakes. The perique is such a condiment here, it really isn’t fair to compare this to true VaPer blends. 

Summary: I still prefer Marlin. 

My Background: I got my first pipe at 18, and stuck with it well into my 20s before wandering into cigars for a decade. I have recently returned to the True Faith. I cut my sandwiches diagonally, always ask for plastic bags when shopping, and believe razors should only have one blade. 

Score: 3

--
tribial: I agree about the razors! I enjoyed reading this review ( and the others)

--
pixeechick: Not havering tried either yet, but both being available to me, can you elaborate on my you prefer Marlin Flake to Old Gowrie? 
--
boomer56: Well, the answer to that is entirely subjective. They are both excellent tobaccos. 

Marlin is just more interesting to me. The flavors are bigger, and so have more space to evolve over the course of the pipe. I am a perique fiend, and blends that use it well (or do I just mean more?) tend to be the ones I reorder more often.  Also, Marlin keeps the flakes fully intact, and seems to burn a little better as a result (that may just be placebo effect). 

I have two tins of Marlin deep in the cellar, one of which I'm going to open (very soon) at 15 years when something suitably cool happens and the other? I haven't decided. I'm having as much fun choosing the occasions as I will smoking it. I can't imagine ever being attached to OG that way. 

TL,DR; I like it better. 

But surely the proper course here is for you to try them both and decide which *you* prefer? :)
--
pixeechick: But of course. I don't seem to enjoy Perique that much, but blends like Anniversary Kake and Luxury Navy Flake are tasty to me. Haddo's cooked my tongue; I guess there's something in there that doesn't quite agree with me, so I tend to avoid it in large quantities. If it's the additional Perique you like, I may try OG and see if there's enough in there to offend or just enjoy. Thanks for the detailed writeup!

====================================
Mordenkrad: I'm going to play devil's advocate for the sake of it here because we've got a lot of solid "recommend" reviews here.

I give Old Gowrie a 1 of out of 4, and here's why.

It's good, but isn't outstanding at anything it does. It's exactly what you expect it to be, it's rich and a little spicy but mostly just a nice darker-ish VA flake. It's sort of one dimensional, but that doesn't make it bad.

Here's why it gets a 1; it doesn't stand out. There are other blends like Scottish Autumn Flake and GL Pease Union Square that are better at being Old Gowrie than Old Gowrie is at being Old Gowrie. Those two blends I mentioned as examples are richer, more complicated, and more satisfying than OG. 


So, I'm not saying you shouldn't smoke Old Gowrie, but if you can, you should go for something better.

pixeechick: If it's good and exactly what's expected, wouldn't that merit a three, or at least a two? I don't get the rationale for one star. "Not stand-out" seems like "that's why I could only give it a three and not a four". 
--
Mordenkrad: Nah, look at the way Scripto outlined his rating system.

"1 = Would not recommend"

I don't recommend this blend because it isn't outstanding or remarkable in any way and there's other blends like Scottish Autumn Flake that are. You could argue for a 2 at best.
--
pixeechick: Yeah, I am familiar with the system. I guess we just don't Interpret it the same way. 
--
beaker75: This "review" is really confusing. First you're talkin about Marlin Flake, and in the end you're talkin about OG (which isn't even a flake). Almost looks like you haven't even smoked it. And saying it's bad, because it's just not as good your favourite tobacco is kinda dumb imo. Feels like Metacritic, when some kid rates movies or games either a 0 or a 10, and nothing else.
--
Mordenkrad: I got the names mixed up, not the tobaccos. They're pretty similar but I smoked them both. 

1) Would Not Recommend

2) Somewhat Recommend

3) Recommend

4) Strongly Recommend

I would not recommend old gowrie because there are better tobaccos that fill the same niche and life is too short for mediocre smokes, but please, please continue to tell me that my OPINION is wrong.
--
beaker75: Funny thing is, my opinion is quite the same as yours. It's good, not outstanding. There's better tobaccos out there for sure. I just would rate it differently. Lowest score sounds like it's rubbish, but it's still a decent tobacco. Imo.
--
Mordenkrad: Blame scripto's rating system, I'm just giving it the score that best fits my view on the blend.

====================================
crimsonrat: Late to the party, but here's mine. 

It's a solid blend, but for a Virginia, not my personal favorite. I'm going to give it a 2.5, it burns easily, but isn't as sweet as I usually like. It is fairly complex and somewhat woodsy, which I do like. It's really at home in the last 1/3 of the bowl, surely stoved from smoking at a slow pace, which is necessary,because this stuff, at least to me, burns hot as hell. I enjoyed it, but I won't be hoarding a whole lot of it. 
--
====================================
PipeBeard: Solid 3 stars from me.  This is to VA/Pers as EMP is to english/oriental blends.  It's a good, solid faithful that serves well as a daily driver.  That also means that as much as I cherish this blend, it doesn't completely blow my socks off (and that's perfectly ok).  The sweetness is there, the tang is there, the bit of spice is there.  While none of those three stand up and shout, they play well together.  This has been for some time, and will probably always be a regular in my rotation, and if I smoked one blend all day, this might be it.
--
levins0: Yes, that's a great comparison to EMP. I was somewhat disappointed that the flavor didn't hold up against the tin note. I've had better va/pers, so probably won't buy this again, but it was ok and I would smoke it if I had it.

Tin Note: Fruity and sweet, like a sweet wine or raisins.

Cut: Broken flake, though it looks more like plug that met a cheese grater. Almost like that old bubble gum "Big League Chew". I like it.

The Smoke: I lit it up in a Boswell Egg after letting it dry for an hour. It lit wonderfully and stayed lit the entire bowl. I gave it two "helper" matches throughout when the puffing got wispy but that was it. From the get go The smoke was cool with an almost sweet taste but not quite. Almost no spice on the retro. A very natural tobacco taste. About ten minutes in the sweetness picked up, and the retro yielded more spice. A smoky flavor moved in to the mix as well. Not overpowering  but it was there. The blend held this flavorfor the duration of the bowl. Only change up was another small (likely just cumulative) increase of spice on the retro.

Summary: I give it a solid 3. I really like it and have smoked five bowls so far about to have a sixth. I can see this easily being an "all day smoke". I like that this blend is so consistant. 

About me: Relatively new to pipe. Cut my teeth on cigars and expanded. Also sorry if it isn't the best review, I don't write a whole lot and need some practice. My favorite blends tend to be perique heavy VaPers. But I actually enjoyed this one more than I thought I would.

====================================
pr0sp3r0: besides fribourg and treyer, astley's and wessex, in the last 10 or so years rattray's has been my go to VA tobbacco manufacturer. i'm saying VA, and not VA/PE, because in my experience, the musty hint of perique is  undiscernable in OG. i've been smoking it for years no, smoked through a number of 100g tins, and i had to check tobaccoreview because i didn't want to believe it has perique in it. it's not like three nuns, or my other all time favourite VA/P blends (dunhill deluxe navy rolls, escudo, some veery fine wessex flakes). 

so old gowrie is a very nice, balanced VA blend in my opinion. not as good as marlin flake or my  other fav rattray's, the toasty-malty brown clunee, but definitely better than hal o' the  wynd. 

for me it's like this: if i want a  steady burning, nice, not too complex, but not boring, nice balanced virginia, i pack a pipe of old gowrie. 

i strongly  recommend this for an every day tobacco, and i love that i have a  couple of tins at home, but if i ran out, it wouldn't be a DEFCON situation. if i ran out of marlin flake, navy rolls or F&T vintage, i would sound the alarms.
--
pixeechick: Another vote here for Marlin Flake over OG. Any reasons why? I'm stuck between the two.

====================================
pipingphil: **The Leaf:** Long strands of broken flake with some larger bits in between. Fairly dark for a Virginia heavy blend. According to tobaccreviews.com, it consists of Virginia, Kentucky and Perique. [Picture](http://imgur.com/4vqOvpB)

**Tin Note:** Very pleasant. Fruity ripe Virginias accompanied by delicious Perique sweetness. Fermented windfall on an orchard in the summer. 

**Packing, Lighting &amp; Smokeability:** The tobacco was a bit wet right out of the tin but nothing dramatic. OG likes to be packed lightly. Bigger/wider bowls seem to be beneficial, at least if you don't want to rub it out more. I smoked it in my Rattrays Celtic Dublin which worked beautifully. Didn't need many relights, didn't bite and burned cleanly to very few strands of dottle. 

**Taste:** initially, the Virginias seem to be on the forefront, with enough of the Burley/Kentucky to give it a solid foundation and enough bass notes to keep it interesting. The taste settles into notes of bread, cereal and oats, with a nice subtle sweetness reminiscent of sweetened oatmeal. Must be a delicate dose of the Perique. Delicious! Over the course of a bowl, the Burleys seem to take the stage more with their slight nuttiness and earthyness, the tobacco gets a little more toasty, spicy and less sweet, but nothing overly complex. Just rather straightforward deliciousness. 

**Room Note:** I almost never smoke inside, so my notes on the room note are not too valuable. Old Gowrie seems to smell rather nice, with the oaty sweetness coming through. A bit like as if someone was baking a slightly smoky bread. 

**Nicotine:** Somewhat above medium. Satisfying but not overwhelming. I would compare it to My Mixture 965 in terms of nicotine. Don't smoke it on an empty stomach and you'll probably be fine. 

**Thoughts:** I like it. A lot actually! Old Gowrie is not overly complex but rich and delicious. When I got the tin, I jarred about half of it for a few months of aging, and the other half is almost empty by now. I tend to reach for it rather often when I'm in the mood for something full flavored that is not an English or Kentucky. It's a pretty straightforward but perfectly blended tobacco. With a beautiful flavor profile. I'm pretty sure I'll buy it again. 

**Rating:** 4/4

**About Me:** I've been smoking a pipe for about a year now after a few years of the occasional cigar here and there. I’m generally not a huge Latakia nut, but like Virginias, and VaPers a lot and have gotten a taste for Burley and Kentucky lately.

antiwittgenstein: Solid, informative review. Thanks mate!

====================================
Cycleoflife: 
**Rattray's Old Gowrie**

**Tin note:** raisins, fig, plum, wet grass

**Moisture:** Definitely needs a good dry out. 

**Smoke:** Even burning, slow and steady. Likes to stay lit even at a snail's pace. 

**Flavor:** Quite understated. I expected more perique influence based on the tin note, but it was really a symphony of the VA and the KY each fighting for the stage. 

**Nicotine:** Medium 

**Aftertaste:** A little sweet VA lingers on the palate

**Notes:** I had trouble making any opinion on this blend. I liked it far less than I thought I would but I could never pin down the reason. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the blend and it burns very well. When I realized KY was in there it made more sense to me. Burley is just not my thing, I guess, so for me this blends is a VaPer not ruined, but muddled. This is just personal preference and I can see that this is a quality tobacco that others would enjoy, so I still give it 3 stars.
