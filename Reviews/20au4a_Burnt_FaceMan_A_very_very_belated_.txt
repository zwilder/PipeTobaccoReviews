A very very belated review of something especially horrifying: a bowl of Hitler's Favorite

A couple months back there was a thread entitled "What is the foulest tobacco?" in which /u/jimjimwest posted a picture of something that had been floating around his pipe club- a bag of ["Hitler's Favorite."](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/1s2mnm/whats_the_foulest_tobacco/cdtgbbo?context=3)  He sent me a bit of it to try out and in return I promised a review.  I unfortunately didn't get around to trying it for a while due to lack of smoking opportunities, and then when I finally got to it I wrote down some notes and forgot to post them!  

Now bear with me as I haven't actually reviewed tobacco before, but I still would like to share my thoughts on this!  Here we go.

I open the envelope to [this sight.](http://i.imgur.com/L32c7NW.jpg)  Right off the bat I knew I was dealing with some top-quality stuff.  Tobacco I could smoke while I invaded Poland, or something like that.  [This was wrapped up inside.](http://i.imgur.com/PUOnLnT.jpg)

I opened the envelope and the tobacco's pungent smell assaulted my nostrils like a panzer tank.  Okay, it actually smelled kinda like fig newtons.  Kinda reminiscent of an aromatic called Nougat that I picked up at my local tobacconist.

I lit this up in a corn cob I purchased for the occasion so that I could try the tobacco out without worrying about what it would do to one of my briars.

For a blend of "floor sweepings," it was not awful.  The taste is what I imagine eating the concept of a "war machine" would be like.  It burned hot and smoked quickly.  The initial taste was very, very spicy.  After a few minutes the spice taste faded a bit and what was left was really reminiscent of the way a cheaper aromatic tastes, minus the pleasant smell.  I was having a hard time placing the smell (though my sense of smell is pretty crappy.)  The taste was almost hollow and somewhat bland.  The spice sort of mingled with this for a bit then it was all bland for a bit.  Once I got to the second half of the bowl it started tasting almost like leather.  Not quite like a brand new leather jacket, more of a faded leather taste.  The smoke lasted about fifteen minutes.

I'll probably bust it out again and give it another try soon just for the hell of it, and see what a few of my friends think as well.  See if it makes big strong aryans out of them.

Thanks again /u/jimjimwest for sharing, and sorry again for the late review!
====================================
soymilkisgood: It's kind of ironic they'd choose Hitler to name the brand after, because he staunchly opposed tobacco use of any kind.

facestab: Genocide and tobacco don't mix. Wait ... yes they do
--
None: I bet it goes terrible with juice. I heard Hitler hated juice.
--
Burnt_FaceMan: I was originally thinking about comparing the smoke to the gas chamber of a concentration camp but I think that would have been taking it a bit too far.
--
HWKII: You think so?
--
Burnt_FaceMan: Just a bit.
--
facestab: lol no. Hitler hated tobacco but the growth of the British empire is hard to separate from the development and spread of tobacco. 
--
Rotschefeller: My thoughts exactly. They name it after the one guy in WWII who didn't smoke.
--
jimjimwest: I had nothing to do with naming it :-)  I would have likely called it 'Red Headed Step-Child' or something along those lines.
--
====================================
jimjimwest: No worries :-)  This fullfils the 'pics or it didn't happen' portion of the review :-)  This is a great review btw, even though this tobacco changes every few months as more detritus is added.  Perhaps some others with experience in this weed can contribute their impressions from that months blend.
--
Burnt_FaceMan: Thank you!  Yeah I think I'm gonna have to give it another go when my friends try it and post all the opinions here.  This stuff is interesting for sure!

====================================
scriptonic: Jim sent me some back in october I want to say, burned hot and almost had insta tongue bite. I jarred it up and recently just cracked and I gotta say, it aint half bad (mind you I did add some stuff to it). It has mellowed out a lot and each bowl takes you on a different journey. Todays bowl started out grassy and citrusy and ended up tasting like a cherry chocolate mix. 
--
Burnt_FaceMan: I agree it wasn't all that bad!  I went into it expecting something fierce but I felt like the flavor jumped all over the place when I smoked it.  Gonna be worth busting out again in a few months for sure.

====================================
bob_12: This made me laugh (as a WWII history buff) and makes me *almost* want to try a bowl just to see what that bastard would have smoked if he wasn't so against any kind of tobacco use.
--
====================================
None: Very vivid use of imagery! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
--
Burnt_FaceMan: Glad you enjoyed it!
--
====================================
NotReallyTheOneAtAll: I really want to try this now. I'm also thinking that I should get a separate jar to collect any left overs that aren't enough to fill a bowl on their own and start my own hodge podge of a blend. Note if only I could come up with an equally interesting name...
--
Burnt_FaceMan: Something vulgar preferably!
--
NotReallyTheOneAtAll: I'm thinking Unwanted Stepchildren. Cause it's all the stuff that just didn't measure up. 
--
Burnt_FaceMan: I'm digging it.
