New Order and A Review
By: hemingway184

Hello all,
Last week I asked for you [assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/51xrte/super_pumped_for_first_order/) in purchasing a few tins of tobacco. I settled on Squadron Leader, Frog Morton Cellar, and Dunhill Nightcap.   
I just finished smoking a bowl of the FMC and it was incredible. It smoked very well and required only one relight. The tin note was awesome, reminded me of a heavily peated scotch. Upon smoking, it was more peat and campfire smells, taking me back to my summers in the woods.   
My next purchase is on its way, having picked up Seattle Pipe Club Mississippi River, Anniversary Kake, and Frog Morton On The Town and a big bag of pipe cleaners. This decision was formed using your feedback, so thank you! Looking forward to posting more.
====================================
Pipezilla: Great choices!  Nightcap is one of my favourites.

reddbdb: Smoking it right now :-). Delicious.
--
hemingway184: That's my bowl  for tonight!
--
====================================
MentionMyName: Mississippi River and Anniversary Kake are two of my favorite.
--
hemingway184: Glad I chose well! The Mississippi river looks especially interesting.
--
MentionMyName: While my experience is pretty limited (just started about 2 years and 20-25 blends ago), I haven't had anything like the MR.  It's earthy (a characteristic I appreciate in wine) and somewhat manure-y... just different and great.

burks21: My new order came in today to. Most are suggestions from users here (minus the Virginia Gold, buddy wanted some). New order https://imgur.com/a/tDYm6

hemingway184: Awesome, looking forward to trying the Nightcap.

====================================
misterzipp0: Enjoy the Anni Kake, it's quite tasty!
--
hemingway184: People seem to love it on this forum!
--
misterzipp0: With good reason! The perique and sweet red Va's give it a great dark fruit and chocolate flavor with just a bit of spice.
--
hemingway184: Nice. I am stoked, think I have a solid base  of tobaccos until I head to the US next. The selection up here is a) limited and b) way overpriced. My local tobacconist wanted $35 before HST for a tin of nightcap.

====================================
brainskan13: Frog Morton on the Town is one of my all-time favorites! I prefer it over the regular FM (both are good). I love the aroma and flavor of the added Basma (oriental) in it. That's what I am smoking today. Yum!

Anniversary Kake is really good too.
--
hemingway184: I love the art on the side of the tin, such a neat looking item.
