Review - CS Tabac Du Chocolat (My First Review)
By: asabassa1
---
**Blend Name:** Tabac du Chocolat by The Country Squire Tobacconist

**Blend Type"** Aromatic

**Description on Tin:** The Squireâ€™s original chocolate blend is reborn!  This silky cocoa treat packs in the flavor, while offering a cool smoke that burns to a fine white ash.

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish, Virginia. Ribbon cut with large chucks of the Cavendish.

**Tin Aroma:** The apartment I live in uses "Package Concierge for deliveries. I get a text message when something is delivered, I go downstairs, type in my code and a locker unlocks with my package in it. I wasn't in town when it  was delivered, so it sat in the locker for a day or two. Immediately upon walking into the mail room I could smell something sweet in the air. I opened the locker and was smacked in the face with the smell of chocolate. The tin note is outrageously strong and overpowered the 3 other aromatics that I purchased alongside this one. (All shipped via plastic bag) 

Once I got it upstairs and jarred it, I waited a bit and then reopened the tin. With a fresh nose, I immediately picked up what is absolutely Chocolate Tootsie Roll Lollipop. Even as I sit here smelling the open jar, it's all I can think about. There's a very subtle caramel just below the slap in the face that is Chocolate Tootsie Roll. 

**Taste:** As I drew in the smoke for my first taste, I used my tongue to push it up against the roof of my mouth before slowly retrohaling. The smell of Chocolate Tootsie Roll Lollipop was gone and replaced by slightly sweetened cocoa powder. I taste what I think is the caramel that I smelled in the tin note, but am now second guessing myself and thinking that its a creamy vanilla. Almost like the center of a Goetze Caramel Cream.

I draw in more smoke, this time gently letting it escape around the the stem of my pipe. There might be fruit, below the milky chocolate, not fresh fruit, but something preserved. I think its a mix between the good, dark cherry served with a Manhattan and the Wild Hibiscus Flowers in Syrup/Honey that the trendy bars have. Its not floral, but chocolaty and faintly fruity. 

As I get further down the bowl, chocolate continues to be the main flavor of the blend. It's semi-sweet now, and the further down the bowl I go, the creamer it gets. The smoke is full, creamy and voluminous. The doggo I'm suppose to be walking isn't happy. She makes a run for it and I choke a little on the smoke as I scramble to grab the leash. Between her, and a passerby having a cigarette (whom she was running towards), I lose focus but can still taste the sweetened cocoa powder.

**Smokability:** I can't tell if my packing was that perfect, or this blend was just right, but only one match and two tampings (tampings? I'm rolling with it) were needed for the entire bowl. The smoke was creamy and not too dry. There's no ashy texture to my mouth which was more common in some of the recent blends I've been smoking (looking at you, 11 year old Start of the East Flake). 

The smoke was cool the entire time, but my bowl was very hot. I smoked out of a Bing made by a local friend from a Pipe Club, and this particular pipe tends to get hot when used as the bowl is on the thinner side. I often hold it by the long shank as I smoke, rather than by the bowl.

**Room Note:** I got nothing. It smelled like outside...?

**Thoughts/Summary:** The experience was a chocolaty smack in the face, and I loved every second of it. When I was little, my mom would sometimes make homemade hot chocolate on the stove, melting it down, slowing whisking in the milk, frothing the milk chocolate liquid and filling the room with an intense sugary, chocolaty aroma. This blend brought me right back to that kitchen table, sipping from a hot mug of milky chocolate. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, this was very good.

**Recommend to:** If you've had the Stonehenge re-release and you wanted more of the mild undertone of Cocoa in that, this'll do you right. Also for dog lovers, those with beards, those who have seen the movie "Hackers" 3 or more times, and Hornblower's of Southfarthing.

**My Background:** I've been smoking a pipe for a couple years. I've restored a pipe, I've made my own Black Cavendish and I've tried (and purchased) a ton of tobacco (#TAD). My favorite blends at this moment in time are:

- English: Torn between Star of the East Flake (minus the aforementioned ash) and Penzance.
- Va/Per: Haddo's Delight
- Virgina: Full Virginia Flake

I don't usually smoke Aromatics, but I'm glad that I did today!
