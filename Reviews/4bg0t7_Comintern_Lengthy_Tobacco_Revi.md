Lengthy Tobacco Review #2: Escudo Navy De Luxe
By: Comintern
---
Good Evening everyone I cracked open my tin of escudo a few weeks ago and I've been smoking it a ton so I figured I'd write a review.

**Age** I bought this tin probably six months ago but the date code says 2014 November 8th.

**Cut** It's a spun coin cut tobacco. When you open the tin the coins are laid out in a beautiful cascading ring. Seriously it looks fantastic

**Smokability** It's pretty moist out of the tin so some drying time is necessary. I left it in the tin for a week or so before moving it to the jar. As it is now I rub out 2 coins and let them dry out for about 20 minutes. Once you get it to a good consistency it rubs out easily, packs well and burns very well. Incredibly well behaved in the pipe.

**Tin note** Sweet, rasin-y tobacco pretty much straight up. It's got a bit of caramel note as well as some toasty hay. 

**Taste** It's pretty straight forward hay like virginia with some caramel sweetness. The perique is subtle mostly giving you a slight pepper on the tongue and some tingle in the nostrils. It does add some sweet raisin to the flavour but it leans more towards caramel, hay and toast. Not a flavour bomb by any means but an incredibly pleasant experience.

**Verdict** If you couldn't tell I love this stuff. It's really really good. It smokes like Orlik Golden Sliced's big brother with creamy sweet smoke and a bit more perique forward. To me this is the ultimate all day any day smoke that won't disappoint. It's just pure relaxation all the way down the bowl. If it's not my favourite tobacco it's pretty damned close.

**Background on me:** I've been smoking a pipe for around a year now and cigars before that. I'm mostly a Virginia/Perique or Virginia/Kentucky smoker. I smoke English blends as well but much more rarely.


**My Top 5:** I mean these could change on any given day but here's the list
1: Escudo Navy De Luxe
2: GL Pease Sixpence
3: Penzance
4: C&D Haunted Bookshop
5: GL Pease Jackknife Plug
====================================
Sku77s: This is one of those tobacco's I tried early in my pipe smoking days I keep wanting to revisit but never makes it way into my cart. This review has changed that. 

On a less connected but still important note don't browse for tobaccos and browse r/pipetobacco at the same time.

Comintern: yeah that's a recipe for disaster for sure.

====================================
DOMIDANN: Never smoked this before, but I've heard many great things.  How does this compare to Luxury Bullseye Flake?  If I understand correctly, this is a straight VaPer, while LBF has some burley and cavendish as well, but that's the closest I can think of that I've tried before.  
--
Comintern: I don't believe there's any burley in LBF just the cavendish core. It's a little similar however Escudo's a bit richer and creamier in my opinion. I haven't smoked LBF in quite awhile so it's hard to remember although I do remember liking it.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I've had serious problems smoking all of the PS flakes.  The look gorgeous, they smell wonderful, and the price is right, but none of them worked for me.  I think it is something in the toppings, as I'm generally a fan of VaPers.  I've never tried Escudo (though I have a tin just waiting to be cracked) so I can't make a direct comparison.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Another solid review. I've not yet made my mind up on this stuff. It is good, but it is so far from the Perique bomb I was expecting it confuses me still ever time I load it up.
--
Comintern: Yeah when you hear it talked about as such an example of a VaPer you do tend to imagine it as a perique bomb but it's really not
