PTM Review

====================================
vertdeferk: Oh look. It's another PTM review.  Let's make this mildly interesting.

I opened up an envelope I couldn't recall ordering, and lo! It was full of this insanely amazing smelling tobacco. MY PTM HAD ARRIVED.

First impressions- HOLY FUCK THIS IS AMAZING! Like, bread and buttery treacly almost maple syrup. Sometimes the scent of sweet would be overwhelming, but another sniff and out comes the bread, and buttery and something vaguely grandmotherly in the background.

Lit it up in my reliable little Willard with a small bowl- perfect for a shorter smoke.  I was impressed with how well this stuff lit, and stayed lit. I smoked it all down except for a little dottle, and that might have been my packing.

As for flavor... I couldn't pick up much initially, either in my mouth, or retrohaling. However, about a quarter of the way into the bowl, I started picking up tasty smooth buttery aftertastes. 

The smoke, from beginning to end was smooth, mellow and not too hot. I tried to make this run hot and couldn't. All in all, it was a very delightful, and pleasant smoke, and I did it while preparing a plate full of sausage links which I smothered in pepper jelly and ate on toast.

coldsolderjoint: Gun, sausage, edc quarter dump.. fuck I love America

TenRussians: Aromatics of this nature haven’t been my cup of tea for a number of years. I’m a Latakia kinda guy, but it’s a well written review. Thanks.

====================================
Dys-funk-shun-all: What's the make of your sidearm? Couldn't make it out.

vertdeferk: Sccy. It's a pretty nice little 9mm pocket carry. I just  figured to turn out  my pockets for that  picture, and then tossed in some old silver quarters I had laying around. 
--
Dys-funk-shun-all: Nice, I love 9mm. Stopping power and magazine size are balanced there for me. I can also put more downrange faster than at .45. I've been hit with a ricochet from a nine and I found it quite stopping so I don't need anything bigger personally. Not that I don't Have larger, my EDC is a taurus 9mm with a one pound compensator, nail driver.

vertdeferk: This, or my Makarov is my EDC. Or I kick it up to .41 mag if I'm going in the woods. 

Or downtown Seattle.  /s

Japheth28: Would you rather have your makarov or the sccy for pocket carry? I’ve been looking at makarovs too. I’m an undecided mess 
--
vertdeferk: The Mak is a bit too bulky and has stuff to snag and is 8+1, while the Sccy is designed for pocket carry, sleeker, lighter and 10+1. Plus ammo is easier to get.

Do what I did.

Get both.

Poopsock_Piper: My girlfriend has the same 9mm sccy, nice little piece. However, I absolutely cannot stand the trigger on them, I think this is by design though, for safety. 
--
vertdeferk: Oddly enough, I like the trigger. Friend of mine hates it, another friend who is a wheelgunner likes the  trigger. My friend who hates it, is a Glock man. OTOH, I hate the trigger on his LCP II. The lesson I get from this is that it is important to celebrate diversity. 
--
Poopsock_Piper: Haha that makes sense, I’m a glock man myself and own two. Yeah, it does remind me of a wheelgun trigger. Cheers to diversity!
