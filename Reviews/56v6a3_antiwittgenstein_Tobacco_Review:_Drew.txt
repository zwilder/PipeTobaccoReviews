Review # 79

**Blend Name:** Drew Estate Harvest on the Hudson
 
**Description on Tin:** We used to go up Hudson in the fall to go apple picking at the orchards and this is the memory of those times all packed into your bowl. Mild and wonderfully flavorful with notes of freshly cut apples and a smooth blend of Virginia, Burley, and Cavendish tobaccos. 

**Leaf:** Lots of dark Cavendish with some lighter ribbons in there. Slightly moist to the touch, but not too goopy.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Fruity. Uh, apples. Specifically a green apple. Raisins and figs. Blackberries. Underneath there is some chocolate-caramel. But mostly it is apple cider city. 

**Taste:** Mild nutty burley. Then here comes the apple. It is a bright, green apple. Not quite a fake candy sour apple taste, but it leans that direction. Perhaps more like apple pie made with bright granny smiths, a bit of lemon, and just enough sugar to bring it up to barely sweet. The sweetness is there but extremely well balanced by the sourness. Once or twice a more vinegar tang comes through, perhaps from the casing, perhaps from a bit of Virginia. Sometimes the apple would be joined with another fruit flavor, like blackberries or cherries, but this was rare. Occasionally the apple diminishes for a puff or two, and you get the mild nuttiness again, but on the whole, even at the dottle, the apple flavoring is consistent, making a very uniform smoke with no development to speak of.

**Nicotine:** 4. Rather heavy for a typical aromatic experience.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** You can smoke this stuff from the tin without having to dry your tobacco. I would try this very, very little, as the apple will fade a bit if you let it go too long. Needs minimal relights. It does get a bit bitey, but the bite doesn’t stay with you, and you won’t have a sore tongue post smoke.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but the sidestream seemed rich and appley.

**Thoughts:** I was looking for a fall aromatic and remembered I had grabbed this when it was wicked cheap, maybe $5 for the tin. I am pleased with it, but the freshness of the apple makes me think more of spring than fall. Other than that I am extremely pleased, and rather shocked by the quality of this blend. My only previous outing with the DE pipe tobaccos is the Gatbsy Flake, which was extremely underwhelming. This offering more than makes up for that disappointment. Harvest on the Hudson does what so few aromatics do, actually taste like their tin note, live up to the manufacturer’s description, smoke easily, and as a bonus, delivers a substantial dose of Vitamin N.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** More in terms of quality than taste – Taste of Autumn, Firedance Flake
 
**Summary:** A great smoking, hard hitting, fresh apple aromatic

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2.5 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

SupraMario: Nice review! I've been wanting to grab a tin of this but have been hesitant but since I trust and like your reviews I think it's in order to grab a tin.

TDKerabotsos: I made a post a while back asking for thoughts about how to "tame" HH Bold Kentucky. Turns out a 50-50 mix with Harvest on the Hudson is terrific. Adds some substantial beefiness to the Harvest while taking the edge off the BK.
