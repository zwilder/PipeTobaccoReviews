Tobacco Review: Cornell and Diehl Autumn Evening

Review #51

**Blend Name:** Cornell & Diehl Autumn Evening

**Description on Tin:** A red Virginia Cavendish cased with a delicate maple/vanilla flavor. This is one of those rare aromatics that actually tastes the same as it smells. The three day process that’s used to make the blend is what insures the flavor and aroma.
 
**Leaf:** Coffee bean brown, short ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla, coffee beans, sweet shop, chocolate.
 
**Taste:** Maple syrup, immediately present on the first light. It is accompanied by a touch of chocolate-vanilla. Underneath there are real Virginia and Burley flavors coming out. Virginia zest and pepper. Say a bit of round sweetness, earth, nutty, bready notes, but these are very subtle. Still much more actual tobacco flavors than found in most other aromatic tobaccos. There is a general sense of warmth coming from the bowl, a cozy feeling it evokes. This blend is also not exceptionally sweet. The dominant flavors of Maple Syrup and Vanilla might lead you to believe otherwise, but this is a restrained balanced smoke. Butterscotch.  Very consistent all the way through the bowl.

**Nicotine:** Not much.

**Smokability:** Pretty dry for an aromatic. Smokes a bit fast – what would be a 30 min bowl took about 15 min, but it was after some aggressive drying. Can bite you.
 
**Room Note:** Beautiful warm maple syrup.

**Thoughts:** What does Autumn taste like? To me, turkey, dressing, cranberry sauce. Baking spices like Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves. Pumpkin, squash, in pie or soup form. Beef stew. Peaty Scotch. Not maple syrup, but I am not from Vermont or Canada. But after smoking Autumn Evening last year, I looked forward to it again, as a seasonal treat. And that really underlines the nature of branding pipe tobaccos to certain times or occasions: since our egress from a farm-centric, harvest season society, there is nothing particularly that binds these flavor and aromas associations to these times, except repetition, memory. Autumn Evening is better than most Aromatics, and does hit that sort of warming feeling of comfort and sentimentality that this tobacco is aiming to fulfill. So by that metric, I think this is a success.

After this, I really should try a C&D aromatic the next time I feel brave.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Sutliff Barbados Plantation, Lane 1Q, Captain Black Royal. So aromatics in general, but check out the great set of Autumnal tobacco reviews by /u/ TheWierdAsianKid , [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3nhpe4/autumn_tobacco_review_pt1_straus_sleepy_hollow/ ) [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3nsu5f/autumn_tobacco_review_pt2_russs_blends_apple/ ). I will edit in link Part III, which should include a review of Autumn Evening in it, when it is posted.

**Summary:** A cozy-warm Maple Syrup-Chocolate-Vanilla Aromatic with quality tobacco flavor.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:**++

pylorns: Left out Maple Street from Sutliff, similar for sure if you like those maple flavorings.

pixeechick: I tend to favor Black Gold Maple, but I haven't tried the Sutliff blend myself.
