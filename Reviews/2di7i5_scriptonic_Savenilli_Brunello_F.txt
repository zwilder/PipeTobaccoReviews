Savenilli Brunello Flake Review (Thanks Turner!)
By: scriptonic
---
**Blend:** Savinelli – Brunello Flake

**Blend Type:** Virginia Flake

**Ingredients:** Virginias, Burley and Macedonian leaf

**Description On Tin:** An impeccably structured blend. Featuring a foundation of sweet, tangy Virginias and cool burning Burleys, a dash of Macedonian leaf is added to round out the mixture and add a hint of the exotic. The different leafs are then aged as one, in order to marry and harmonize flavor, prior to being pressed into a tantalizing flake.

**Leaf/Looks:** Light flake, pretty standard looking flake. A few of my flakes had a good sized twig in them. Big enough to be in 3 of the flakes, and about half an inch in length.

**Tin Aroma/Smell**: Very sweet and light. Bits of citrus, figs and honey come through. Reminds me of the smell of wine fermenting but lighter, not as heavy.

**Taste:** You get the citrus and the sweet grassy/hay you would expect from a Virginia flake. The retro-hale is very smooth, mostly the Virginia come out there. I really like the addition of Macedonian leaf, gives it a background lightness sort of floral maybe. I think if they added a touch of Lakeland this blend would be exceptional. The burley is there with its nuttyness, but not over powering at all

Smoke Ability: Burns a little hot, this could change with a few months of aging time. No drying time needed. If you get over zealous it can bite you

**Summary:** An OKAY tobacco to smoke fresh. I do believe this is something that if you sit on it for a couple of years will greatly improve. I am going to pick up another tin and age 50g for 6 months another 50g for a year, and the last 50g for 2 years to see how well it ages. 

Background: I’m a huge English Latakia bomb fan, the more the better, but at the same time I thoroughly enjoy Virginia Flakes and from time to time the occasional aromatic. 

**Pipe Smoked In:** Savinelli Big Nine 703KS.

**Drying Time:** None

**Rating**: Out of 10 I’d give this one a 6 fresh out of the tin.

Dulcinee: Well written, if I wasn't an Aros fan.. I'd probably try it....
