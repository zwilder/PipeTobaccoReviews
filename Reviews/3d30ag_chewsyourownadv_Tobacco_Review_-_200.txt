Tobacco Review - 2005 Penzance
By: chewsyourownadv

A while back, in some unremembered thread, I was chatting about how I didn't altogether like Penzance fresh out of the bag, but that my 2-year had become a pretty nice smoke. Out of the blue, some /u/bonehed lobbed a sample of ~2005 Penzance at me. 4.5 bowls later, I have a tale to tell.

**Blend Name**: Pretty sure it was called Penzance 10 years ago.

**Description on ~~Tin~~ Ziploc Bag**: ... Penzance? I think? I'm really not sure /u/bonehed wrote anything on it. Whatever. 

**Leaf**: Black leaf, with little hints of brown, cut into thick, crumbly flakes. A delicate lattice of sugars and and probably crack were intertwined across the flakes.

**~~Tin~~ Bag aroma**: Oh, now this is different from my 2-year. I don't understand why, but the 10-year seems *sharper* than the younger stash. The latakia is more distinguishable, it seems. My 2-year is a little damp in the jar, while the 10-year was a bit drier. Maybe that means the smokey compounds are more prone to taking flight. I could still smell the Turkish beneath it, and the mild and bready VA. Overall, the tin aroma is similar to my 2-year, with a more pronounced latakia note.

**Taste**: The charring light is beautiful. The first note is, of course, a bit of Cyprian campfire, but it's far less pronounced than the ~~tin~~ bag aroma let on. It's woven into a thick, smooth caramel and sweet bread taste. The next couple of puffs, the caramel is notable, but I could swear it gives way to chocolate and vanilla in turns. There's also the underlying current of earthy Turkish and other Orientals, which I can see will be the base that everything else plays on. And, WTF was that, just a little spice?

The thick, creamy caramel/chocolate/vanilla persists, but a glimpse past that wall of wonder shows the Turkish and Virginias doing the dirty work. The little bit of earthy, leathery notes weave in and out of the flavor, always providing just a hint before hiding away again. The latakia continues its mellow hum, complimenting the blend but never becoming the focus. Toward the end, I got the feeling the Orientals were providing progressively greater spice, but the general flavor remained pretty consistent.

And then there's the retrohale: nuthin'. Maybe I just suck at it, but the retrohale gives me less than the room note. Whatever, this stuff is too good to worry about piping it through my schnoz correctly.

**Smokability**: Hard to say. My 2-year is barely damp in the jar. The 10-year is kinda dry, but then it traveled a ways in a plastic bag. When I cracked its temporary tin for a final smoke, it was too dry, so I rehydrated it. It took well to rehydration, but that made it bite a little from the steam. That's my fault though; the tobacco seemed just fine unto itself.

**Room note**: Nothing special. Again, the latakia seems more pronounced in scent than it tastes. I smoke outside, so I'm sure I missed something, but this smelled like a standard English.

**Thoughts**: It was a hoot, comparing the 10-year to the 2-year. My opinion on Penzance in general is that it's nothing special fresh out of a tin/bag, but it ages well. I like the 2-year much more than a fresh batch, and the 10-year moreso.

**Nicotine**: Not much there.

**Summary**: If you get your hands on a bit of Penzance, lock it away in the cellar. I really think the mystique around it is unjustified until it has a few years on it.

**Rating**: 4 / 4. 

**My background**: Pipes. I smoke 'em.
====================================
pixeechick: Thanks for the review, /u/chewsyourownadv. I'll have to agree with you here generally- Penzance is good, balanced, and quality, but overall there are many more accessible blends that give as good a smoke. Bonehed sent me some as well, but I don't know if it was the same age as the one you experienced. Matches the description, though.

/u/bonehed - Was this the same batch you sent me a sample from?
--
bonehed: Nup, I believe I sent some to you before I acquired the older batch. Yours was from a recently (at that time) opened bag.

Thanks for the reviews /u/chewsyourownadv - perhaps some of the differences, besides vintage, are from crop variations? 
--
chewsyourownadv: Could be. The latakia smoked the way I expected an old batch, being mellow as it was. The extent to which the flavors were intermarried, that it was difficult to pick out any major characteristics for more than a fleeting moment, makes it hard to say. I'll post a review of mine in 8 years, I guess.
--
pixeechick: Thanks for the details. It was tasty all the same. Have a little left; maybe that will be next week.

True that. It's hard to recommend, due to that accessibility issue. Obviously I enjoyed /u/bonehed's sample, and my own 2-year stock is pretty good. A lot of people just aren't interested in holding on to tobacco for that long though, and I honestly just can't comment on how 10-year Penzance stacks against other similar blends at 10 years.

All that said, this was still a very, very good smoke.
