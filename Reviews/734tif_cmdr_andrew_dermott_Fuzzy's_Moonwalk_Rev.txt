Fuzzy's Moonwalk Review

Sitting in the porch with the wife, both of us enjoying bowls of u/Fuzzy_Totemz new Moonwalk blend. 

tl;dr, this is like smoking half-and-half (cream, not tobacco) from the carton.

My wife usually has trouble keeping her pipe lit. Firsts thoughts, "Wow, this just burns!" She was holding the pipe out to demonstrate, and it was happily smoking. I'd say it burns better than the original blend. On that account, I suspect black magic in the blending process. Might just be the change in ambient humidity, though.

Flavour is very mildly sweet, and tastes predominantly of cream. "Latte" is an accurate description of the bag note. If there's any coffee flavour in there, it's subtle. Maybe the tiniest bit of something roasty on the retrohale. 

Flavor is super mild... if this were a drink, I would recommend spiking it with a shot of espresso. This would be tits _with coffee_. It's a touch boring by itself, needs an extra kick of darker flavour to bring it up to the original's level. It does get a little toastier as the bowl progresses.

Porch note is Cappuccino powder (International Delight?), but not overly sweet. 

Requires prodigious tamping when the smoke thins. The ash collapses politely. Very satisfying quantities of smoke produced.

Staunchly refused to burn my tongue, or gurgle. This stuff smokes itself. Relight was also mild and creamy, vs the acrid scalding that usually gets me when I try to relight. Got into a hurry near the end of the bowl, certain it was nearly finished, and smoked it too quickly. Was rewarded with my usually dottle, but no bite.

ETA: Surprisingly, I feel slightly buzzed.

ETA2: OH MY GOODNESS, EAT AN OREO. Makes them taste like s'mores. The cookie tastes like Grahams. What is this magic?
====================================
Fuzzy_Totemz: Hah. It's like a Moonwalk in your bowl, or something.  
  
    
The burn characteristics are really, really good as you noted, partially due to the fact that it's 100% Burley.  
  
It's actually richer in the coffee element than the batch I sent out months ago, but the other blending ingredients are just so good it kind of turns it into a latte as you noted.  
  
I'm not a retrohaler, but when I'm doing the Moonwalk I actually indulge it because it's so pleasant.  
  
I'd be pleased to hear your notes from further smoking. Thanks!

Fuzzy_Totemz: Oh, The Instant Mustache is the polar opposite of the Moonwalk, made them as the smooth v. strong opposites of each other.  
  
The "Space Rogue" I have resting right now will be the "darker but magically damn smooth" Dark Fired Kentucky blend that should win over people skeptical of Dark Fired. 25% and it's still as smooth as Lando Calrissian.

cmdr_andrew_dermott: Count me as a dark fired skeptic. I might have to try that one.

Doesn't look like I'll be hitting the whiskey tonight. I have a pipe packed, but decided to try the Quesada in between. Might be at my Vitamin N limit for the evening.

Fuzzy_Totemz: I had a papas fritas earlier that put me near my ceiling. Love pulling off the pigtail and not having to bother with the cutter.

deceptively potent for a small cigar there

drnickfury: Can't wait to try my kake. I was out all night. Hopefully I'll get a chance on the weekend.
