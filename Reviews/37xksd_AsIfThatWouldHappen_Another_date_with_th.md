====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Having a nice bowl of FMOTB,  a quiet read, and some nectar of the gods fit to quench the thirst of the mightiest kings!

Really looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks when the review happens, not only is Australia upside down, but we are in the future too and it's the 1st here in 8hrs.

====================================
tribial: Soda and a pipe just seems odd to me. I do like Dr P though
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Amazingly it actually goes down really well with most tobaccos, I wouldn't try it with anything that burns your tongue though.
--
Mech528: Diet Dr P too. 
--
====================================
dashn64: God I love that pipe. Got any info on it?
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thanks. It's just a Kiko from Tanzania, they seem to be becoming a bit more expensive now, I want more.
--
dashn64: That's what I thought, I've been looking out for them for months. One seller on ebay has been selling a bunch of NOS but postage is a killer - around $45 from the states. Don't really want to spend ~$100 for another kiko but I just might if it's a really nice one.
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Hi mate.
Any chance you can send that snus out tomorrow? 
--
dashn64: Ha think you've got the wrong guy bro. I've never even seen snus before!
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Haha, not only was it to the wrong person, it was also supposes to be a PM. This is what happens when you play witcher 3 while redditing.

====================================
Ciceronian: Pair it with a review of Memories of Ice while you're at it! Is that your first read through? If so, you are in for a spectacular treat--to my taste that's the best of the series and one of the great fantasy novels of all time. 
--
Ciceronian: Also... It just occurred to me the the acronyms for Frog Morton on the Bayou and Malazan Book of the Fallen are anagrams. Weird. 
--
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Yeah ny first read through, it's great so far, I have slacked off my reading a fair bit these last few weeks but it's great to get back into it, really determined to finish the series.
