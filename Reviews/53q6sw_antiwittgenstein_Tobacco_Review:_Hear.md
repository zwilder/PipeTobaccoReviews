Tobacco Review: Hearth and Home Porch Swing

Review # 76

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home Porch Swing
 
**Description on Tin:** Hearth & Home Signature Porch Swing is a unique blend that will bring back memories of old-fashioned American blends. Three different types of Burley - a mellow white, flavorful toasted, and a rich, reddish-hued version - are blended with a bit of sweet Virginia and a touch of Latakia and Perique. It's finally finished with a hint of rum flavor to evoke memories of the kind of blend that grandpa used to smoke

**Leaf:** Variegated brown to bright leaf. Surprisingly chunky, like this is a very broken flake.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Surprsingly sweet and fruity. Rum raisins, chocolates, earthy, hay, bran flakes. Wonderful.

**Taste:** Bright and sweet. I mean pretty tangy and sugary for something I really think of as a codger’s style burley. And steadily spicy. There is still some burley flavor there, a mild nuttiness, and some deeper earth. The blend reminds me quite a bit of Carter Hall here, which tastes like a nice mild Virginia to me, but my palate is overly tuned to Virginia flavors. There are some other sparks here, a bit of charred barrel type smoke. Raisins, sweet bran – this really tastes very like its tin note. Some rum raisin here and there. I almost suspect this is a mixture of Anniversary Kake and burley, with a few specks of dark fired thrown in. About the halfway part the burley flavor comes up. That is a bit surprising as usually Virginia comes to the fore as a blend progresses, but no, here the same earthy-nutty-char takes the center, but the sweet-tanginess is there most every puff. Grows more charry and a bit ashy down towards the dottle. Don’t chase this one too greedily as it can go bitter.

**Nicotine:** A firm 4. Relaxes me when I have had a good meal, makes me a touch dizzy if I don’t.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** This stuff is dry enough to pack from the jar, but I never got through a bowl of this without a couple of extra relights. Might be my packing though.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but my beard smells pretty tobaccoy.

**Age When Smoked:** About 6 months.

**Thoughts:** Well I seem to be on a run of accidentally reviewing soon to be discontinued blends. Like I am the cat at the old folks home who curls up next to the person who is going to go next. The question is: should you try to hoard some of this stuff before it is gone? I respond with a resounding *maybe?* If you are a fan of the C&D burleys but wanted something a bit lighter, absolutely. If you are a Virginia hound looking for an easy introduction to burleys, yes, this would be worth your while. I like this stuff, quite a bit, but nothing about it shouts that it is special or spectacular. That is of course, its point, trying to be an old fashioned old codgers blend.

This one took me awhile to review and I think that is because right as I was ready to review it, it changed on me. My first 5-10 smokes of this stuff convinced me it was a solid burley blend. Then… no it is a Virginia forward Va-Bur. I think that might be because I waited just long enough for the Va to come alive, which now feels like the main course of this blend. That is another caveat for those considering a last chance purchase of several ounces of Porch Swing: its gonna change on you. I bet if you smoke it fresh, it will lean burley. After a year or ten? I reckon it will be an entirely different beast. Most likely delicious, but even more Virginia dominated. Or the years could create a harmonious marriage. Without anyone having a chance to actually cellar this stuff long term as of yet, this is a complete guess about what you will be getting into.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** 3 Friars, Carter Hall, Haunted Bookshop, Country Gentleman.
 
**Summary:** A somewhat spicy, Virginia forward old codger style va-bur.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**++++

Rating system (interpreted through the signs of fall):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (That first cold crisp day)

(++++) Great (Autumn Leaves – the actually leaves, though the song is nice too)

(+++) Very good (Football)

(++) Good (Hiking season returns)

(+) I think like it (Baseball playoffs)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Pumpkin spice everything!)

(-) I think I dislike this (Rememberences of having to go back to school)

(--)This is not for me (Getting stuck in school traffic)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Fall allergies)

(----)This is suffering (Drunk college kids – it is 1:17 AM on a Tuesday, get it together you souses!)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (School shooting season commences)
====================================
MentionMyName: First review I've read of yours. I'm a fan of your + rating system. Do you have a blog or site you post these where they are archived?
--
givemeyours0ul: You'll run into then occasionally on tobaccoreviews.com
--
antiwittgenstein: Really? Must be someone else using the same idea - I've yet to post any of these over there.
--
givemeyours0ul: Really? I could be misremembering but I swear I saw one in your format over there. Pretty funny too. I wonder if someone copy pasted one from here? I don't remember the author name or blend.
--
antiwittgenstein: There are at least a few smokers here who have used it, so it might be working its way into the general populace. At first my instinct was to me irriatated, cribbing my style and all, but then I realized that was dumb - I came up with the 11 point balanced scale because the normal ones suck when trying to describe something that should have a nearly Gaussian distribution. So it makes me happy. I just need to knuckle down and throw some reviews into /r/scotch where people really don't know what they are doing. 100 point scale with an average score of 83? That is mathematical abuse.
--
TDKerabotsos: Should it necessarily be Gaussian for any single rater, though? I suspect my personal ratings distribution would be bimodal (comprising the "good" and "bad" blends). A given tobacco is more likely to strike me as a 7 or 3 than a 5. 

Truly not trying to be pedantic, btw
--
antiwittgenstein: You are correct that most distributions (especially with small sample sizes) wouldn't be Gaussian, but over in scotch there are users with 100,200,400 plus reviews. And these drinkers, through that time, hit those rare bottles that they say reach perfection, and also experiment with bottom shelf blends. I bet they have nice bells, but that there would be very few bottles rated below, say 70 for most reviewers.

Of course I also have a lopsided bunch, but this is due to self selection, actively seeking out blends I hope are +++++. I don't know if any of mine have actually been --- or ---- rated. Usually I dislike things a bit or think they are abominations.
--
antiwittgenstein: I actually haven't posted them anywhere else and have been very, very bad at putting them on the archive here. I will try to tackle that soon, at least before I hit the 100 mark.

====================================
misterzipp0: Is the Latakia so slight that it comes through as dark fired? There was a pretty light hand used in El Niño, would you say it's more or less?

Great review btw!
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! Yes it must have been the Lat. I write these fairly blind and am frequently wrong about the composition. I think it is more honestly to just let the mistakes stand.

I don't think I have had El Nino? If so, I wouldn't be able to recall it at the moment. It is very, very light, just a small touch of fairly pure smoke, no other say soap or lavender flavors that would have clued me into it being Latakia.

====================================
mcguire: For us outdoorsy types, I respectfully ask all reviewers to add a "beard note" section. Thanks, muchly.

By the way, nice username. 

TODO: grow beard.
