====================================
Dadgy: 221B. It's one of my favorites, and I'm always interested in other people's impressions of tobaccos I consider under the radar.

levins0: I agree. I tried some a couple of months back in a sample after I found an aged tin at a shop. I've since bought a few more tins. Really tasty, and definitely under the radar.

feernot: Da shag.

====================================
aelmer2821: I'll leave this be for 24 hours. In the morning tomorrow, I will review the most popular. CAVEAT: I'm not the best reviewer, and have an ignorant palate. Be forewarned.
