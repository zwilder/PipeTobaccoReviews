====================================
Roadside: I'm thankful for this as I could not for the life of me figure out whether or not people genuinely liked this or were doing some of the hardest trolling I've ever seen on this sub. 
--
mgvsquared: I still refuse to believe it is not an elaborate troll until my pouch of it comes sometime in the next week. For science!
--
Roadside: I was ordering tins yesterday and had it in my cart, but removed it after deciding I still didn't want to risk it. I'm eager to see more input since I do actually want to try it if it's worth it. 
--
====================================
feernot: I'm thinking about donating my 2015 bag of Penzance to be mixed 50/50 with this stuff...

For science! Who's with me??? 
--
RustyShackleford09: You won't. If so, ill donate Stonehaven from 2000. 
--
feernot: Wait. So is this a 3 way split blend altogether???
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: im helping some friends im an overseas pipe club in asia get some hard to find stuff

before you grape that stuff, send me a half oz to add to their goodie box

disclaimer, the grapist is my shtick but these dudes in singapore really want to try aged eso flakes, dunbar, and Dorchester

--
Fuzzy_Totemz: also, I'm totally graping the singapore pipe club
--
stogie-bear: I'd trade for some of the resulting blend. 
--
trolljoy: "grapes of stone"
--
linearone: Purple stoner?
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: Ordered my pouch last week. 
--
====================================
HKing9678: I don't smoke my pipe a lot but when i do its usually Captain Black Grape. Its nice to see it get a little love  
--
====================================
PhilosoPiper: I really enjoyed this review. I have a friend who does something similar to *"The Grapist"* where he mixes Lane Raspberry and Shortcut to Mushrooms... It is delightful!
--
====================================
atlgeo: This one weird trick ads were genius. My favorite was "this one weird trick will forever eliminate hemorrhoids."
--
====================================
Fuzzy_Totemz: im using my blue comoys lighter to smoke autumn evening while watching this.

im working through a whole ounce of CD Autumn and its nowhere near as pleasant as grapist.
--
====================================
dogmoby: How different is this from Captain Bob's blend?
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: because part of the uniqueness is your own mixing. Every grapist is a snowflake. 
--
Son_of_South_Broad: > Every grapist is a snowflake.

You do words good
--
linearone: He do that right yup.
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Captain Bob's is a boutique McClelland  blend. Part of the fun here is cutting an otc with proper straight blends. Maybe the effect is the same, but this is fun. It's like a tuxedo with sneakers. 
--
linearone: Dunno never had it
