Review - Dueling Epiphanies

Some time ago, our very own national treasure, Professor /u/hedonaut, mentioned C&D Epiphany in a conversation. Components were discussed, including Epiphany's mild latakia content. Having a bit on hand, I was a little surprised, having never detected a bit of latakia in it. Turns out the little bit I had from a... trade? free sample? I don't recall... was, while enjoyable, unlikely to have actually been Epiphany. When I so elegantly asked of the good Professor, "Latakia? Dafuq?" he decided to send me a sample of fresh Epiphany, and accompanied it with a sample of the 7.5 year old Epiphany.

Dafuq, indeed. This is the tale of their duel for my favor.

**Blend Name:** C&D Epiphany

**Description from C&D:** Reminiscent of the original Revelation said to be the favorite of Albert Einstein, this singularity is an adroit melding of Virginias, Burleys, Latakia, and Perique in unified harmony.

*My comment:* C&D makes no mention of the topping, being a supposedly light vanilla-ish fruity-ish kind of thing.

**Tin note (fresh):** Yep. There's the latakia. Whatever I had before, must not have been the real thing. It's not at the forefront by any means, but adds a vague savory note to the scent. It mixes well with the light vanilla. There's supposedly a fruity scent to be made out, but I might be getting it confused with the ever so slight mix of perique and its dark, dried fruit scent. That unruly bitter note so characteristic of young C&D burley is there as well, confusing things just a bit.

**Tin note (7.5 yr):** Much what I expected compared to the fresh stuff. The burley has settled down in its old age. The latakia has mellowed a bit, and it wasn't strong to begin with, but it's more noticeable. Strangely, that vanilla note is still there and not subdued at all. And still, if there is a fruit note, I can't tell the difference between it and the possible scent of perique.

**Taste (fresh):** This is a pretty rich blend right off the light, though it calms down quickly. I was at first surprised at the tangy flavors that present immediately off the light. It's a particular mix of fresh burley, maybe that fruit topping, and freshly lit Virginia. As it calms from that, it becomes something familiar, a weaker OJK with latakia perhaps. The topping becomes mildly apparent, mostly vanilla in the background, and it does play very nicely with the latakia. That along with the dark Virginia and Perique makes me think for a moment of  of chocolate and vanilla flavored coffee. It's unfortunate though that the topping is subdued very quickly as the burleys do their thing. 1/4 of the way in, the topping is gone, and I'm left with the still pleasant chocolate coffee taste, though the chocolate idea recedes without the topping for contrast. The burley is making itself known with its nutty, slightly alkaline taste and peppery sting on the retrohale. It mostly stays like this, if I'm careful, though the burley gets significantly punchier in the end. 

It's smokable all the way through a bowl, but... C&D burley is infamously bitey in fresh batches, and that's certainly the case here. The initial tang and peppery spice can be nice, but finicky. Careful with it, or the bottom half of the bowl will leave you regretting your impatience. Either smoke a little at a time, or smoke a little slower than you normally do.

**Taste (7.5 yr)**: I'd have thought this is a different blend. Professor /u/hedonaut is relatively confident that it is the same recipe as the fresh stuff, though, so that's what I'll assume. 

First up, the thing that gets me is the topping. I've just held it as a generally accepted fact that flavored toppings degenerate quickly over time and lose their taste. Weak as it was in the fresh stuff, I just expected not to taste it all, and am happily wrong on that front. Somehow, the vanilla hasn't degraded, and I even get some sort of the other topping flavor (blackberry maybe, it's very fleeting... or maybe it's the perique?), but everything else mellowed enough to let it shine. In retrospect, I think the burley and perique were too much in the way on the fresh batch.  

It's vaguely smokey; the latakia has dulled quite a bit and wasn't too prominent to begin with. It's barely-there, enough to occasionally remind me that it exists. It's possible that I'm only picking it up because I know to look for it, but there you go. It's more vague Oriental I get than latakia, I think. The vanilla/coffee flavor persists, I think due to the matured Virginia and mellowed-but-still-nutty burley.

It stays pretty mellow through the bowl, deepening a bit as it goes, but never becoming significantly richer, and never biting. Even the retrohale is nice and calm, although it does start to pepper my sinuses toward the end. This blend's components have definitely had time marry, and the result is a consistent smoke that, while complex, doesn't develop into much of a surprise as it goes. Some of the younger C&D blends can change quite a bit per puff, as one burns out of one component and into another, but this one is much the same throughout. It's very good, and it's good in the same way all the way through.

**Nicotine:** Very mild nicotine in both, but I have the metabolism of coked-up house fly and am maybe not the best to judge this.

**Final Thoughts:** Epiphany is a good blend, but if purchased fresh, consider letting it sit in a jar 3-6 months. As often the case in C&D blends, the burley comes out swinging. It isn't heavy in burley, but what little it has does get in the way. Old Joe Krantz, Haunted Bookshop, etc, all improve significantly after about 6 months, and I suspect this young Epiphany would do so as well. With that in mind, I might buy a bit to keep on hand, and forget about it for a while as it mellows out. I don't expect the result to be as great as letting it sit for 7.5 years, but it should be fine after 6 months.

The older batch was incredible, as one might expect of any good quality tobacco that has a few years on it. I'm still pleasantly boggled at the persistent vanilla, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it.

**Rating (fresh):** 5/10. With a little age, this might improve the score quite a bit. (**EDIT**: By "a little age" I mean most likely around 4 or 5 more months)

**Rating (7.5 yr):** Holy shit / 10. Wonderful.
====================================
mugwump867: Nice review!  Epiphany is my love/hate blend.  I've been trying it off and on for going on seven years and have yet to get a decent smoke out of it but there's something lurking there in the background that I enjoy and I'm just going to keep on trying it until it clicks or I die, whichever comes first.

chewsyourownadv: That's kinda my feeling too. I'm setting the remainder of what I have aside for a while to revisit in a couple of months. It should turn out better.

antiwittgenstein: Excellent review, one that is very much unique, and quite edifying. Thanks!

damadfaceinvasion: I couldn't get into this stuff by itself, but I'd mix it with some frog morton and enjoyed that a lot more.  To be fair I never jarred it for more than 2 months. I have definitely learned that about C&D blends though.  I did like the "plum" flavor I was getting, so I could see myself getting some more and jarring it in the future.
