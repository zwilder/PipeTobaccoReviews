So I came home from my trip and a package was waiting for me. I went a little nuts on the accessories, and I am glad I did. I was a bit hesitant at first to spend more money on anothrr pipe when the Alan Brothers line was released. Happy to say I don't regret it. 
The pipe is very nice, with a good blast, and lines. The bit is comfortable. The pipe is a bit heavy to clench comfortably without a softy for me, if I am doing other things. Passes a cleaner well. The pipe roll is much more functional then I expected and I am also very happy with the zippo. I was using a bic  before, and I feel this gives me a more even light. The packaging was all top notch and well thought out. The tamper is.... awesome. I really like the shaping end, it does a fine job of pushing the bits of unburnt tobacco in towards the ember. It's my new favorite. Also really dogging the little pipetag/stand. It is a great touch. I woulf (and probably will) purchase another Alan Bros pipe. 
====================================
ChefPD: Really nice pipe, man. You did go all out on accessories, they look really good all put together. Let us know how it smokes for you.

tribial: So far so good. Only puffed one bowl of  haunted bookshop/1q mixed so far and it went really well right to the bottom with one relight. I literally think I bought one of everything in their store. Kept going back and forth then just dove in. Even got both zippos because I couldn't decide. First world problems. I blame you...by the way.

tribial: Also, is there a way to post a photo/link with text? I am using flow so that may be the issue

ChefPD: The alien blue app on mobile allows you to post links and the actual reddit website allows you to post a link, but you have to just write out what you want to say in a comment.  Anyway, of all the things you could blame me for, I don't mind taking the heat on this one. I stand behind my recommendation, hopefully that pipe gives you some good years.

facestab: There are some interesting EDC items in that shot. Is the copper tube a flashlight? 
--
tribial: Yep. A Maratec triple AAA. It's a great little light and a great value.

JAlanPipes: Right on!  Nice spread!  And thanks for giving us a shot.

Comintern: got some nice stuff there. The pipe roll is looking pretty. how's the haunted bookshop? I've got some on it's way right now.
--
tribial: I mixed it half and half with 1q due to it being very dry and a bit harsh. I  kught it in bulk, and wonder if the tin moght have been better. Also just aort of starting with Burley's sl it could have been my expectations.
