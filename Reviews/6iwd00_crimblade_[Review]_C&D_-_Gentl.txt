[Review] C&D - Gentleman Caller

**Blend Name:** C&D Gentleman Caller

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** Grandma always kept a couple bowls of this fragrant blend of Virginias, Burleys, and a dash of Deer Tongue and Perique around as potpourri to make her favorite beaus feel right at home when they came calling. A Robillard blend.

**Leaf:** Burley, Perique, Virginia, Deer Tongue. Topped with Alcohol/Liquor. It's an interesting mix of light brown ribbon cut and smaller green flakes mixed in.

**Tin Aroma:** Fruit, Vanilla with a hint of mint. I can't help but think of canned cherry pie filling.

**Taste:** Unexpected. Sweet with a vanilla softness. A hint of mint occasionally in both the smoke and retrohale. There's only a faint background of spicyness from the perique but the base layer throughout all of it is a bready fruity tobacco. But, and this is a big but, throughout the smoke you will get moments of pure vanilla mint.

**Smokability:** Smokes very nice. Out of the tin it's moisture level is great for a smoke with only the occasional relight. However this doesn't really detract from the smoke as often times you'll find yourself just sitting breathing in the room note the fills the entire area. It does stay lit better with a little drying but honestly it's not really needed as the blend smokes cool.

**Room Note:** About that room note. It's a smokey herbal vanilla that is just amazing. Even smoking outside you get wonderful whiffs of the room note as you sit wondering what exactly it is you're smoking right now. The potpourri description is incredibly accurate. Hours after the smoke you'll still smell that herbal smoke in the area. Days later you'll still notice that herbal smoke. This stuff doesn't just ghost your pipe, it ghosts anything it happens to touch. I'm fairly certain my patio chair is forever haunted by the ghost of the gentleman caller. Do not underestimate this blends ability to ghost.

**Thoughts:** Deer Tongue is one of those components that is very polarizing. Everything I'd read about it, including this sub, basically says it's a love/hate component, more so then lakelands tend to be. It's that controversy that actually made me interested in trying it. After sitting on the back burner for a long while I finally picked up a tin of it. Well as soon as I got my tin I just had to try it. So I popped the tin and was blown away by the tin note. I wondered if this would end up being basically an overhyped aromatic. Well I was wrong. I'd also forgotten about the caution of it's ability to ghost. Long story short I now have a country Gentleman cob dedicated to the stuff. Here's the thing about dedicating a pipe to the stuff, the strength of the deer tongue only grows so that after a few smokes in the same pipe it's a pervasive flavor and scent throughout the smoke. If you decide to try this stuff you have to dedicate a pipe to it, I'm not sure how much you'd have to do to get that ghosting out otherwise. 

**Recommend to:** If you enjoy vanilla or mint in your aros. If you're not a fan of aros but you'd like to have some interesting flavors in your smoke, without the danger of tongue bite. Anyone looking to experience a flavor they're unlikely to experience from any other smoke. 

**Summary:** I really enjoy this blend, but it's ability to ghost anything and everything in it's vicinity frightens me a little. Thankfully the ghost is a pleasant aroma and it has one of the best room notes I've experienced. I think the only way that this blend could get more ghosty is if you were to stick some grape in it and watch nations crumble. Gentleman Graper, is what I believe that particular variant of grape would be called. I only regret I don't have any grape to make that atrocity happen. 

In the end it's not an everyday smoke for me, but damn is it good when I do reach for it, my only real problem with it is that it is such a powerful flavor and experience that it ends up being too much for an evening where I want to ponder the world rather than the smells that surround me.

**Drink Pairings:**  Green Tea, usually just water, anything else just got weird with the vanilla mint of the deer tongue.

**Final Rating:** 3.5/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp and GLP Quiet Nights.

chewsyourownadv: Nice review. I've got a little on hand, and trying to decide whether to stock up a bit on it or Crooner.

>Gentleman Graper, is what I believe that particular variant of grape would be called. I only regret I don't have any grape to make that atrocity happen.

You know who I bet has some of both? /u/thesillyoldbear, that's who.

Yes! /u/thesillyoldbear make Gentleman Graper a reality please.
