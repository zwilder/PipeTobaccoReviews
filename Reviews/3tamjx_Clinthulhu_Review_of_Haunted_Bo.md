I’m going to be honest; this was a really difficult review for me to write. I wanted to like Haunted Bookshop in the worst way but unfortunately I just couldn’t make it work for me. Something; and I’m not entirely sure what, has gone really… really… wrong with this blend. All the right ingredients are there for a good pipe tobacco, Burley, Virginina, Perique, but something just isn’t working. 
I will be the first to admit that I was completely sucked in by the name of this tobacco. Haunted Bookshop is just a kick ass name for a pipe tobacco blend. Then, after reading The Haunted Bookshop by Christopher Morley, I was even more excited to get my hands on this stuff. So last month I added 2 ounces of it to my shopping cart and started watching the mail like a hawk. When it finally arrived I ripped open the box, pulled out the zip-lock bag full of Haunted Bookshop, (it was a bulk blend) grabbed one of my corn cob pipe from the shelf and ran to the back porch. What happened next was kind of like watching Clubber Lang beat the shit out of Rocky in Rocky III.
 
**Round One**
As a non-aromatic blend I wasn’t expecting anything amazing when I opened the pouch. It smelled like fresh tobacco, earthy and a little like grass with a hint of smoky spice mixed in. The tobacco is course cut but there were a few big chunks floating around in it. I found this to be a bit odd since C&D usually does a fantastic job keeping the “mulch” out of their blends. The moisture content right out of the bag was great and I didn’t need to dry it before smoking. I used the Frank Method to load my cob and then with much excitement I fired it up. 

Wow… this was not at all what I was expecting. I puffed a few more times to make sure it was lit, tamped it a little, then let it calm down before taking another. Man, does this stuff comes out swinging!  Before I continue I should mention that I’m a big fan of strong, robust tobaccos. I like a good robust cigar and I have smoked non-filtered cigarettes for years. But damn! This stuff was strong with a capital “S” and for the first time in a long time I got a lump in my throat. I battled my way through the first bowl and as I went it became harder and harder to enjoy this blend. The flavor wasn’t bad, leather with a peppery quality to it but the smoke was incredibly sharp. As the person doing the smoking, it isn’t always easy to tell the “room note” of a tobacco. I usually I count on my wife for that information but even I could tell that this stuff doesn’t smell good. The smoke coming out of the bowl burns your eyes and nose and is horribly acrid. I soldiered on through that first bowl, bobbing and weaving to avoid getting sucker punched but over all I was sure that I lost the first round. 

I honestly can’t tell you where things fell apart here. I did a little research and one mystery I have uncovered is that tobaccoreviews.com lists Dark Kentucky as one of the ingredients of Haunted Bookshop. I can’t confirm if this is true as Cornell & Diehl doesn’t listed it as part of the blend on their web site but after fighting my way through several bowls, it sure seems to me like it could be in there. 

**Round Two**
I’m not one to throw in the towel and I try to take a lot of different factors into consideration while trying a new tobacco. If my first impression isn’t good I give it a few days and then try again under different circumstances. For round two I selected a larger cob, (my MM Country Gentleman) with the hope that a larger bowl would let the tobacco burn a little cooler and deliver a better experience over all. 

I’m not going to go as far as to say that it was a night and day difference but my second attempt was much better. Part of this may have been the fact that I knew what to expect this time around so I could brace myself for the punches this time.    

For those of you who are cigarette smokers looking for a blend to help transition to the pipe this would be my first recommendation. It is definitely a blend that doesn’t screw around and if you are having a hard time finding a tobacco that has enough nicotine in it to curb your desire for a cigarette you won’t be disappointed with Haunted Bookshop. As I said earlier, the fact that this blend might contain Dark Kentucky could be the problem for me. Even without an accidental inhale you get a major throat hit with Haunted Bookshop. On the second attempt I took my time, making sure I didn’t overdo it and I still ended up with a lump in my throat. On the plus side however I do believe that the larger bowl of the Country Gentleman helped to make the tobacco less “bitey”. I finished the second round with a little more success than the first but I would consider it a draw. 

**Final Round**
A few nights ago, with a beer in hand I grabbed my Country Gentleman, packed another bowl of Haunted Bookshop and got back in the ring. I decided I wasn’t going to go down without a fight, so I pulled on my “big boy pants” and came out swinging. As I’m sure you can imagine, things it didn’t improve much. I will say that the beer did help and again I imagine that if you are trying to quit smoking cigarettes this would be a great blend to try. I could definitely see myself smoking a bowl of this while drinking beers with my friends around a camp fire. Aside from the overall strength of the tobacco it does have some good qualities. I enjoy the flavor and in the right conditions, (outside) it is possible to get past the harshness of the smoke coming out of the bowl. It will give even a seasoned veteran a nicotine buzz and it complimented my beer pretty well. But pound for pound I think I was just out of my element with this one. I’m not going to say there won’t be a rematch but I think it will be a long time coming.

Overall I really wanted Haunted Bookshop to be something I could add to my daily tobacco rotation. Unfortunately it’s just not out of my weight class. I had high hopes, (perhaps too high) and with such a cool name and its relationship to the Morley novella I was completely bummed out that Haunted Bookshop gave me such a beating. If I had to call this fight I would say that I did much better in rounds two and three after I had my ass handed to me in the first but I still count this as a loss. Maybe in a few months I will try again.


====================================
annoyingbeggar: This is one of my favorite blends but is absolutely a slow sipper for me. I love it for exactly what you mentioned, hanging out with friends. I can light it up, take a couple of sips, set it down and pick it up again 10 minutes later. 
--
Clinthulhu: It is definitely a blend that has it's merits. I didn't absolutely hate it by any means. I think I just need to smoke it in the right context. Thanks for reading the review!  
--
====================================
BWeice: I bought a 4oz bag out of impulse, I love the stuff and how you described it is pretty accurate. Maybe I love to suffer but also when you get it just right it taste like Hearth and Homes Anniversary Kake ( to me anyway ) with a burley kick to the gut.
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: Jar it, give it about 3 months, and try it again. HB is one of those C&D blends that's a little too punchy for a lot of people when fresh.
--
Clinthulhu: Absolutely! I usually cellar tobaccos I don't immediately care for and then revisit them after they have sat for a while.

====================================

chewsyourownadv: C&D's own descriptions imply there is more perique in OJK:

>**Haunted Bookshop 2oz**  
Another of the late Bob Runowski's blends, named in honor of the famous novel written by Christopher Morley. A Burley and VA blend with just a touch of Perique.

vs.

>**Old Joe Krantz 2oz**  
Dark and cube cut Burley with red Virginia ribbon and Perique create a smooth, all day smoke. It's named in honor of the man who taught Bob to smoke a pipe: his grandfather.
--
hedonaut: Old Joe is way way heavier in the perique department. I think the throat reaction is coming from the white burley.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice review. Thanks for posting it here - I am too lazy to click those links and scroll down. How does this compare in taste and strength to some other tobaccos? OJK, 3 Friars, etc.?
--
hedonaut: Dryer and more mellow than OJK, heavier and more burley forward than 3F. I'd place it as a bridge between, with the nic content being closer to OJK.
--
tennesseean_87: I'd call it brighter than OJK, too. 
--
====================================
hedonaut: Well done on the review! Toys blend is one of my most favorite, and my typical morning smoke (though Pegasus has been featuring a lot lately). After it's sat for a few months to key the white burley give up some odd its ammonia, try a really loose pack on a big bowl. HB is predominantly cube cut burley. It will expand greatly when it starts to burn. This means if you pack the pipe normally, it will become over packed and have a tendency to burn too quickly. That might be some of the trouble you're having with it.

--
tennesseean_87: I need to get the Pegasus back out. It's been a few months, and I bet it's maybe rounded out into something even better than my first impressions. 
--
====================================
C-Ray6: I'm a fan of this one. This blend smokes a lot like a cigar.
--
====================================
NapalmBBQ: Brilliant review and many thanks for it. I also tend to get roped in by the name. I'm going to pass on this for now. 
--
====================================
jirohen: exactly what you've typed is what I'm dealing experiencing with old Joe krantz. I had a bowl of haunted bookshop two nights ago and it was wonderful to me, but this stuff... wow, it Dees like I've got a hairball in the back of my throat, and I've stuck two lit cigars up my nose. I'm half way down and I can't finish this.
--
====================================
GanDuff: Thanks for the review, pretty enjoyable read, like the last two. The way you describe it reminds me of Bayou Morning; that stuff is stout as all heck, and knocked me on my ass. I also really liked the name of Haunted Bookshop, but alas, it seems I'll have to pass on this one.

Cheers
