Simple strong and shaggy review #1 - g&h dark birds eye
By: professor_throway

As part of /u/antiwittgenstein ‘s review contest, I am doing comparative reviews with strong shag cut burley blends Dark Birds Eye, Kendal Kentucky, Kendal Dark from Gawith and Hoggarth and Five Brothers Pipe Tobacco! The idea is that these tobaccos, while different in flavor, all sort of serve the same purpose high nicotine, simple but strong flavor profiles, and an easy burning shag cut. 

For the review contest this is #4

**Gawith and Hoggarth Dark Birds Eye**

* Description on Tin: None bulk only

* Description on tobaccoreviews.com: Manufactured from Dark tobacco 'whole leaf' rather than strips, the mid-rib (or stem) gives the 'birds eye' effect when cut. A strong smoke which was particularly favored by the fishermen as the finer cut meant the tobacco was easier to light and to keep-in on board ship when the weather was bad. Notes: This is a combination of dark-fired whole leaf Virginias and mid-rib fine cut Kentucky leaf rolled and sliced to make 'bird's eyes'. This fine shag cut was preferred by fisherman and sailors because it was very easy to pack and light.

* Component Tobaccos: Dark Fired Kentucky, Virginia

* Cut: Nice shag cut. Long and stringy. Hard to pull a small pinch out of the jar. Thicker cross-cut tobacco veins, like little discs peppered throughout.

* Jar Aroma: Unmistakably dark fired. Also a weird smell, like something fermenting and not necessarily in a good way. Smells a bit like dry cured cigars that use Kentucky. 

* Taste: Has a lot of qualities similar to HH Old Dark Fired, however...  **more**. The taste is strong but monochromatic. It doesn’t change from top to bottom. Again is the taste of something fermenting which I assume comes from the VA. It tastes like rotten fruit but in a good way. The Kentucky is smoky and stronger, a little earthy and nutty. Overall the blend is sweeter than I would have expected. It is sweet in the way dark chocolate is sweet, it just takes the edge off the bitter but doesn’t flood you with sugar.

* Strength: Strong. These are not lightweight tobaccos. The nicotine effect may seem slighter due to cut. As it burns faster you are not physically taking as much in. Still try in a small pipe first with something sweet to drink on hand.

* Smokability: Packs and burns like a charm. Pack significantly tighter than you would for a nice ribbon cut. It will help slow the burn. The strands are long and stringy you may need to pack then rip or cut off the extra hair sticking out.  Burns cool. Don’t think you could get to bite if you tried.

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. Seems pretty potent in the garage. Pretty potent, lingering cigar like odor. 

* Thoughts: I tried this for the first time a few months back, when I got some in a trade. I quickly burned through that and purchased 4 oz more. It is an effortless tobacco if you can stomach the nicotine. When I smoke it I am reminded constantly of Old Dark Fired. I recently tried smoking them back to back. When compared side by side really they are different blends that share some common attributes. The ODF is much mellower and less thuggish on the taste buds. Dark Birds Eye can be rough around the edges (but not as much as Kendal Kentucke or Kendal Dark). If you like dry cured Toscano style cigars, this is a great blend for you. I like this blend a lot but couldn’t smoke it everyday, it is too monochromatic for that. It has some attributes of an all-day blend, in that the flavor is simple and constant, plus it burns well. However the strength and shear volume of flavor sort of knocks it out of that category. Since I only smoke or (rarely) two bowls a day I generally want something with a bit more complexity. The shag cut and quick burn mean that this is a great tobacco for when you are outside in the cold or bad weather. I have taken to brining this along when walking the dog at night, you can do a small bowl in a 15-20 minute smoke and feel satisfied from a flavor and nicotine point of view. This is my favorite out of the G&H shags and I will always keep some around.

====================================
professor_throway: I should note that I don't get any Lakeland Essence or floral flavors in Dark Birds Eye.

antiwittgenstein: That was exactly what I was gonna ask. I mostly foreswore all of the G&H blends because of too many soapy surprises. It's a shame because they have some truly amazing stuff.

iGamerz_mge: Great review.  This is one of my favorite smokes.  Love Kendal Kentucky also.

====================================
Alligator_Gar: You may be smelling a little Tonquin and molasses. As far as the cut, it acts similar to a bowl full of pubes.

SmokeOnTheWater17: Tonquin in DBE? 
--
Alligator_Gar: I know the word on the street is ‘no tonquin’ but I think I detect some in mine.
