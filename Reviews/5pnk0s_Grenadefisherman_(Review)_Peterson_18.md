====================================
Grenadefisherman: 1865 The end of the American Civil War, The assassination of Abe Lincoln, The introduction of a speed limit in the UK and the year the Messrs Kapp and Peterson got together in Grafton Street in Dublin to create a dynasty that continues to this day. What better place to start?

Blend Name - Peterson 1865 Original mixture.

Details - 100g tin Â£24.99 obtained from my local B&M.

Description - A luxury blend of the finest tobacco leaves and Latakia provide a full bodied smoke for the experienced smoker.

Environment - 0600 hours (I am one of those Nightshift warriors) enjoyed with a decent french pressed Italian coffee with the BBC news propaganda machine on in the background.

The tobacco - An obvious ribbon cut blend of Virginia with unmistakable Latakia. Room note is pleasant but not overpowering which I was expecting. A nose of the tin offers leather with a pleasant must finish.

The smoke - Good consistency being ribbon cut and the tin was ready to smoke from opening, moisture content was bang on. The first light was strong and the second perfect with an even burn all the way through the bowl. Good white ash formation. A 'smoky' blend with an overt Latakia but not overpowering the room, note is pleasant.

Summary - Personally I was surprised, I was expecting a far strong Latakia taste/smell but a quality English (Irish) blend. I normally take the notes from the tin with a pinch of salt but in my humble opinion they are bang on, not a tobacco I would point inexperienced smokers in the direction of but those who know...... Well..... Know!

anxst: Great review, sounds delicious. I'll have to think about adding a tin next time I order.

It's always weird to think that they started this company in Dublin in such a disturbed time in Irish history, and they made it all work. It had only been 17 years since the potato famine. The Poor Relief Act had just gotten passed, and in two years the Fenian Uprising began.

p4ttythep3rf3ct: Sounds like a perfect time for a bowl or two.

Grenadefisherman: I think that through the darkest of times the human race can find solice in the most basic of needs. Food, drink, tobacco and especially the arts. A couple of mouthfuls of porter and a bowl of this sure would have reset my sorrows for a much needed short term breather.....

Furthermore I would like to thank everyone for the kind words. I am new around these parts and the welcome is warm and at the risk of sounding threatening I'll be hanging around!

WhenSnowDies: That looks really nice. Thanks for the review and for bringing awareness to this tobacco. As soon as I'm not on such a strict budget, I'll be giving it a try.

Boy!  Glad you didn't die!

Grenadefisherman: Yeah me too, saying that breathing in and out will kill you and that's before we factor in crossing the road without looking both ways, getting too much direct sunlight and eating red meat!
