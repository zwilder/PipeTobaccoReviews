Once again, dear readers, we delve into the mire, on this trip of conflagrant confectionary. Join me on this adventure as we try a classic- Dunhill Flake!

As always, a history lesson: [this man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dunhill#/media/File:Alfred_Dunhill_in_1893.jpeg) is Alfred Dunhill. This is the man responsible for many of our favorite blends and brands. He started his career as a Luxury retailer, specifically to the Motorist ( cars being a luxury item at the turn of the century). To this day, you can still find that Dunhill of London, aside from our preference towards tobacco and pipes, is still a luxury brand (i have a Dunhill suit and wear Dunhill cologne). His original pipe was developed to provide the perfect smoke for the motorist, and had a [shield](https://pipedia.org/images/0/08/Dun_012.jpg) to allow a better light and smoother smoke. His tobacco shop opened in 1907, and he later opened shops in both NY and Paris, as his aspirations were international. 

On to the tobacco! So this is a pretty decent VA, fresh and sweet in the tin. There are no other tobaccos used in this blend, just straight VA goodness. God bless the commonwealth. Seriously though, its got just enough topping to hold it together during the press process, and all that comes through is that bright smell, like walking though a sweetgrass field in the summer time. 

Packing: These are wide flakes so your options are either to use half, rub out, or have a big bowl. I use a big bowl, and the fold and stuff method. NOTE: For those of you that are uninitiated, when lit, flakes expand. Hence the need for a bigger bowl for a whole flake. 

Smoking (or, what you all really want to know): For a flake this lights easy. Granted, I dried for a bit first, so that could have something to do with it. Char is easy, and once that takes place, a couple of long pulls will get it going. The first half is sweet. Think, mowing the lawn and having a beer sweet. The VA with that light, sweet topping is relaxing in it's own right. The flavor tends to last, although the topping becomes less noticeable, and the VA shines through with its earthiness. Now, to be noted, I did have to tamp less with this than other blends. It may be the consistency of the flake, or maybe I have just gotten better at smoking. Either way, it does seem to hold a coal better for some reason. The second half gets bolder, stronger in flavor. What was sweet becomes cloying, earthy becomes gritty. Now, for those of us that are recovering Cigarette smokers, this is not necessarily a bad thing. However, I can see where if you weren't a cig smoker before, this may not be the smoke for you. There is very little dottle, and the nicotine is pretty level. I would equate the nic to EMP, not very high, but consistent top to bottom. 

Drink pairings: Don't ask me, I have a heathens palate. It went well with Builders (English tea), Boston Lager, and surprisingly well with my Grandad's eggnog (recipe, granddad died 4 years ago) which is equal parts Maker's Mark and Egg Nog. It doesn't pair well with my morning coffee, nor does it pair well with Moscato. 

Well, you have been regaled with history, literary commentary, a weekend safety brief, and closing with more history. I found I have fun with these things, and may do more in the future, however, only time and tamping will tell. There you have it /u/antiwittgenstein. Until next time readers, drive on, and drive classy.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for another entertaining review. I hope you just mean the last review this month, not the last you'll ever do. I think I can speak for the sub when I say you've got a great, individual style, fun and entertaining that we'd like to hear from regularly.

aelmer2821: Well, last one for the month. As the holidays approach, I am sure to get more tobacco as Christmas gifts. And then I shall be forced to regale all of you with my musings and ramblings lol.
