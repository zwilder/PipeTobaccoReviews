Review #42

**Blend Name:** Davidoff Green Mixture

**Description on Tin:** Davidoff Green Mixture pipe tobacco is comprised of cured Virginia, Burley, and Black Cavendish tobaccos which deliver an aromatic, well-balanced experience. Fruity, slightly sweet, and aromatically complex, this tobacco is exciting and unique.
 
**Leaf:** There is a lot of variety from yellow to several shades of brown to black, in long ribbons to dusty shake.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Rum, juicy fruit gum
 
**Taste:** Nutty burley with a bit of Virginia tang. Very full, velvety mouthfeel. Casing sugars with a hard to place taste. Kind of like rum extract, vaguely cinnamon and coconut like. Cornflakes? Yep. There is almost a peppery note – is that dark fired? I don’t think so – I must be hallucinating again. Or confusing spice with tongue bite. Cigarette and juicy fruit gum – a kind of off putting artificial sweetener taste. Devolves into a nutty burley again, with a vague chemically sweetness. A bit of chicory coffee comes on top of that, mixing with the juicy fruit. Once found, this becomes the dominate taste of the blend.

**Nicotine:** Surprisngly strong for an aro. 1 shot of bourbon.

**Smokability:** I had a little bite on my first bowl but none after that. The range of flake sizes makes it a bit strange to pack, especially in a smaller bowl. I broke down the leaf even further trying to get a roughly homogenous size.
 
**Room Note:** Rich and elegant, sweet and pleasing, but hard to place or define.

**Thoughts:** Another respectable aromatic, of the kind I am beginning to call a type II aromatic. My sub-categorization being:

Type I: Cavendish based aromatic. This is where Captain Black, MacBaren 7 Seas, and the Sutliff Aromatics I have tried fall. Type I has no discernable flavor from the tobacco leaf so any flavor comes from the topping or casing.

Type II: Cased or topped Virginia, Burley, etc. leaf. Examples include Firedance Flake, Erinmore, Autumn Evening, and perhaps Navy Style Flakes or ropes. This is an aromatic which tries to harmonize the additives with the natural underlying flavor.

This is my one of my first fruit style aromatics, and it being a Type II(Patent pending), it is a bit strange to have the fruit flavors mix with the coffee and tobacco notes given off by the underlying leaf. It makes me fear the Cherry Aromatics I see coming up in my queue. 

**Similar Tobaccos:** Autumn Evening, Erin Go Bragh, C’est La Vie, MacBaren 7 Seas, Sutliff Barbados Plantation

**Summary:** A fruity-coffee aromatic with real tobacco flavor.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
hedonaut: Interesting observation with the aromatic types. We could expound on this observation by positing a type III. A semi-aromatic where the topping acts only in support of the underlying tobacco flavors such as Bob's Chocolate Flake, English Chocolate, and Blackpool. The separations between the tobacco genres are really points on a continuous number line rather than hard values.

antiwittgenstein: I agree wholeheartedly - the terminology is as true as it is useful. It frequently breaks down at the corners - what is Mississippi River? Frog Morton Cellar? 

Type III is probably then where Navy Flake would belong, which didn't feel at home in II.

Thanks for playing along!
