[Tobacco Review] McClelland x30 - Pressed Burley
By: ScowlingIntensified
---
**Blend Name:** McClelland Bulk x30 - Pressed Burley

**Description on Tin:** N/A- Sold in bulk

**Leaf:** Deep, dark red pressed burley in a ribbon cut. There isn't much variation in color or size; this is all burley all day.

**Tin Aroma:** Very sweet with a dried fruit note (not exactly raisin) and just a hint of something rich and spicy like high quality chocolate.  

**Taste:** My biggest gripe with this blend is that it is spicy with a tendency to bite on the initial light and first few puffs. However, once the initial lighting it mellows into a cool, nutty, slightly spicy and slightly sweet burley flavor; it is something to behold. There are very few flavors to use as a point of reference for the puff because it is such a pure and unmistakable burley. Halfway through the smoke the spice in the blend, which I imagine is due to the pressing process, and the nuttiness in the puff lets on to a sort of uncious, buttery quality that plays well with the rest of the blend's flavor. The retrohale removes a great deal of the natural sweetness and brings the burley's nutty characteristics to the foreground; an equally tasty experience.

**Smokability:** I dry this blend almost to crispy due to my own preferences, but it lights and stays lit right from the pouch. It's tendency to bite is worrisome, especially if you smoke too fast like I occasionally do, but it can be avoided. The burley creates a rich and smooth smoke that burns even once it's lit and is a joy to smoke. Much like Carter Hall and Prince Albert, this is light it and forget it sort of blend; it tends to itself besides the occasional tamping. x30 produces a lovely and satisfying amount of smoke.

**Room Note:** Sweet and pleasing; it's smells how a nice summer afternoon feels, and it is one of the best room notes I've experienced short of a true aromatic blend.

**Thoughts:** This is a great, accessible straight burley that offers the flavor profile many burley fans adore. I enjoyed this blend and it's surprising complexity for being a single leaf. I also think that in the hands of someone more talented and experienced than I am this blend could make for a fantastic seasoning or addition to other tobaccos.

**Recommend to:** Burley fans looking for a new smoke, blenders trying to get that special something in their mix, and aromatic smokers looking to branch into some new tobaccos. 

**Summary:** A surprisingly complex burley with nutty, sweet, and buttery notes and an impressive bit of spice considering the blend composition. This blend rewards the careful smoker for some delightful burley flavor.

**My Background:** I've tried a lot of tobaccos from aros to englishes in my past year of being a piper. I couldn't say that I have a favorite blend, but my preferences tend toward sweet and I'll take Virginias over englishes nine times out of ten and I stray from latakia heavy mixes.

gestalt162: What is the nic level on this guy?

ScowlingIntensified: For me it was null. I smoked 4 bowls of the stuff back to back and didn't get so much as a hint of nic.
