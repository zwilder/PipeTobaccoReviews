====================================
erkpik: Was pretty funny. I kept replaying his cough as it was funny to me.

====================================
mgvsquared: Been watching John for ages! The funny and unique thing about this review is he rarely has a bad thing to say about something. The vast majority of his reviews are positive (which he told me once that is one of his biggest concerns...he wanted to find something to balance out all the positivity, hah!). You'd be hard pressed to find something he just straight up hates. Well here ya go!

====================================
Pluize: Am I the only one who really dislikes reviews where the person smokes the whole time between sentences. It makes the video twice as long and I already know how somebody smoking looks like. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Eh. When I watch a Matches review I know what I am in for - a slow conversation about pipes and sometimes life in general. When I first started smoking I thought video reviews were great, as they showed some of the things I couldn't pick up from text, cadence, tamping, draw, etc. Now I almost always skip the video reviews and go straight to tobaccoreviews instead - reading is much more efficient for direct information transfer.

pylorns: This was funny, so my question is, because I don't watch a lot of youtube reviews, how do his usually go? Positive? Negative? Or a good mix?
--
antiwittgenstein: Most of what I have watched him review is stuff he has smoked and loved for years, with a smattering of new things he finds interesting or have been given by the youtube pipe community - I actually have never seen him review something he didn't like before (but I haven't watched his entire oeuvre). He might say this wasn't as great as that, but that is the extent of it. I still haven't watched this video, I should though...
--
pylorns: It was funny as hell. 
--
erkpik: I can take it or leave it.
--
====================================
hicetnunc37: Lol. Matches is the man. So this stuff is nasty huh? 
--
antiwittgenstein: I've had a few bowls and thought it was okay - Matches mostly likes big burley blends so I am surprised he took a jab at this one.
--
erkpik: I'm amazed he could taste anything since his tongue is so fried from burleys.
--
givemeyours0ul: Not nasty, but it failed to deliver. Jar note was enjoyable though.
--
====================================
DoubledPawns: Loved the review! I couldn't stand the stuff. 
--
Highball2814: What he referred to as the gym socks note I think I had labelled as a bream bed smell.
--
givemeyours0ul: I'm not a fan. I have yet to finish a bowl. I usually get to the heel and give up and dump it.
--
====================================
matches626: Subbed to him just for the sweet name
