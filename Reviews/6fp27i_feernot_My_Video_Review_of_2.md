feernot: "I personally don't store my tobacco in the tin, because I find that it dries out. So... I personally store it in a ziploc bag."

matthewsmokes: I like you're video feer, you did a great job ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
--
feernot: I should probably do more, eh? Lolol
--
====================================
feernot: I guess we'll just fully merge our Reddit community with the fine intelligence of the YTPC. In all seriousness, how is it that u/linearone video was better than most I've watched from the YTPC? Haha.

====================================

====================================
blsmothermon: It wasn't smoking the tobacco that gave me cancer...it was this video. 
--
feernot: This. ^ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

blsmothermon: Your assignment is to watch [this](https://youtu.be/EqEeqN2WQD8) five-part video on how to smoke a cigar and report back on what you learned...if you actually survive it.

feernot: "Dutch Masters are some of the best..."

====================================
Pipezilla: I give the guy props for making videos.  I stutter and would never post any thing.
For school I had to post [This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ow--A_mdyc)

====================================
JollyGrueneGiant: What are those other Dunhill blends, the ones you said are hard to find / not as common? Just curious
--
feernot: Never you mind that mindless rambling. I was drunk when filming this. 
--
JollyGrueneGiant: Hahaha it's all good man, I was just wondering if it was some old Murray-Dunhill blends that I never heard about or something obscure.
