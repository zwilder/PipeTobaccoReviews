professor_throway: Great review. Shirt sweet and to the point.

For those who don't know you can get ODF ready rubbed in bulk from the major online retailers. The ready rub is indistinguishable from the flake to me so. It is reasonably cheap about $4 for a single ounce and cheaper as you go up. As a sample to you next order. It is a fantastic blend and a staple in my rotation.

eldritchpipes: Thanks. If you like dark fired you'll love this. If you haven't had dark fired before you'll find it very interesting.
