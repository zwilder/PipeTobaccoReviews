Cornell and Diehl Small Batch - The Beast [Review]
By: inwithbacchus
---
Hey all,

A few people had an interest (like /u/briarboy) in the new Small Batch blend coming out on Friday from Cornell and Diehl. I got a sample tin (not sure what fates aligned for that to happen) so I figured I'd throw a quick review up before I do a formal one tomorrow. So, you guys get the scoop! It'll be quick and dirty but here goes.

***Note: This tin was sent to me, for review, by Smoking Pipes / Laudisi Enterprises / Cornell and Diehl. I don't know why but they did.***


***Blend Name:*** The Beast

***Description on Tin:*** 
*Legend has it that Aleister Crowley, famed adept of the Order of the Golden Dawn and founder of the Ordo Templi Orientis, is purported to have made a habit of smoking rum-soaked perique as a meditative aid.*

*To date, many a dabbler has pursued his own manifestation of this concoction out of sheer curiosity. We have too. And so in the spirit of the nefarious occultist himself, we sought to tame the Beast with our own rendering of the recipe, soaked for seven days in spiced rum, so that we might share our vision of it with the most inquisitive and brave of pipe smokers.*

***Leaf:*** I'd call it ribbon cut. Small chunks here and there but a ribbon cut Tin says it's a mix of Acadian Perique (St. James Parish), Red Virginia Cavendish (North Carolina, single origin, 2008 vintage), Black Cavendish (Dominican Republic), and dark fired burley (Kentucky).

***Tin Aroma:***: Boy...what an aroma. At first you get the rum vapors (fainting couch not included) but once that fades it's heavy pie spice and berry.

***Taste:*** Lot going on here. Topping comes out right away and tastes like rum and berries. As that fades, the underlying tobacco comes through. Heavy pepper and zest, rounded out with a bit of body from the Virginia and nuttiness from the Perique. As you smoke it, the topping begins to meld in with the tobacco flavors and become one giant buffet of things going on.

Smokability: Very smokeable. It's a bruiser though. The tin wasn't lying; this is a blend for slow, meditative smoking. It comes VERY wet in the tin so at least a half hour of drying is recommended otherwise it burns feebly and gurgles a bit. But let it dry and smoke it slow and it's an absolute joy. Would do admirably in a churchwarden, I think.

Room Note: I smoked it outside so I can't QUITE comment on it because it was a bit blustery but it did smell delightful. I wouldn't call it a traditional rum aroma but more of a berry tart soaked in rum and lit on fire.

Thoughts: It's good. It's DANGEROUSLY good...provided you give The Beast it's proper due. Smoke it reverently and it will reward you. Cross it and it will not forgive. Hell, it might even cellar well.

Recommend to: Va/Per lovers who aren't afraid to dabble in aromatics, aromatic lovers who aren't afraid of strength, cultists.

Summary: An aromatic with a spine like concrete and a taste like blueberries and brimstone.

My Background: I'm In With Bacchus. I've been smoking pipes for about 10 years now, off and on. I'm on the internet, if you want to find me.

====================================
carnesy: Got a sample tin myself and am smoking some now. Infact I was about to do a first impression post like this myself, but saw yours when I pulled out my phone. My thoughts are as follows:

Tin note: So this is where all the rum has gone! Followed by an old timey candy smell. Can't place the exact candy but definitely a black liquorice/anise based one.

Tobacco Moisture: Damp feeling but also silky smooth to the touch. I let it dry a bit but didn't let it go as long as I normally do.

Taste: Now that you've placed a name on it I'm certainly noting a blueberry note to the smoke. Perique spice is there but not as heavy as I'd expect given the Crowley reference. Rum is in obvious attendance with tobacco notes there but subtler than advertised.

Room note: Like waving bottle blueberry shnops under your nose with a fresh cut piece of extra rummy fruitcake infront of you.

Nicotine: I have a weird relationship with dear old Nic, some blends people find overpowering don't phase me in the least, while others will hit me as people warn. On the opposite side blends people generally find weak may put me down on the couch for an hour or more. This isn't hitting me at all and I haven't really eaten all day so I guess I'll rate it as YMMV and leave it at that.

Final thoughts: I feel C&D erred on the release timing. This would be a great late fall/winter time blend. It's a hardcore aromatic for people who don't like aromatics. If you gave this to someone who only smokes 1Q and the like, they'll feel as though they're smoking a kick to the teeth.
--
inwithbacchus: Yeah, the blueberry thing kinda threw me. I wasn't expecting berry from spiced rum but there it was. 

As for the timing, yeah, I think a winter release would be better. At least fall. It's a bit heavy for the heat. That being said, it'd be interesting to get a tin and cellar it until December and see how it does.
--
carnesy: Exactly what I'm planning. If Jeremy could make something like this as their holiday blend, Golden Days of Yore/3 kings style (though maybe in Light and Heavy varients for those who mainly smoke aros and the rest of us respectively), I'd buy the crap out of it. Or given that the small batch line is "to experiment and play around" chalk this as a success and see if they could make a regular production blend as close to identical as they could to this one. As to the heat I was lucky in that a series of weather fronts blew through over the last two days and dropped the temp from the 80s to the mid 50s so I got to smoke this in our mutually "idealized" fall like weather.

====================================
FullFrontalNoodly: Any word on how this compares with Haddo's Delight from those who have smoked both?


--
inwithbacchus: Huge difference. It has a bit of that sweet, raisin-y, grass thing from Haddo's but the spiced rum topping really changes it a lot. I'd also hedge my bets on there being more Perique in this blend but I can't QUITE tell because rum.
--
====================================
None: Thanks for doing this.
--
inwithbacchus: Pleasure was all mine. 
--
====================================
DoctorOdd: This isn't even available yet and we've got two favorable reviews! I'm excited to give it a try. I wish I could get my hands on a sample. I've always been fascinated by Crowley and this sounds like a hell of a pipe.
--
====================================
notmynamebutreally: Fuuuuuccc....nice review
--
====================================
GanDuff: I dislike blends that are heavy on the nicotine, so I'm wondering just how much of a nicotine kick there is to this blend. If it's anything even close to Bayou Morning, I want nothing to do with this blend, but if it's your normal nicotine strength or lighter, I'd be really interested in giving this a try.

I think Bayou Morning kind of ruined Perique for me, in a way. If a blend is too stout peppery, I'd also rather avoid it.
--
carnesy: Like I said in my comment, nicotine and I have a weird relationship. Some "weak" stuff puts me on my ass while other blend are just as weak as others say and sometimes strong stuff hardly phases me. I really can't say what the nic content will be like for you.
--
GanDuff: Yeah, I was hoping that OP would give me some clarity regarding this.

Still, thanks for the input.
--
inwithbacchus: Sorry about that! Was busy.

To preface this, I smoke just shy under a half-pack a day of cigarettes. I know it's bad, I know. I'm smoking a pipe more to try and quit. That being said, I was able to skip a cigarette after smoking this blend. So I'd put it maybe middle to high level of nicotine. I think if you smoke slow after a meal and drink something with it, you'll do okay. I'd recommend a Knudsen Boysenberry Spritzer, actually. I think it'd go really well. It's no Black Irish but it's still got some nic to it.
--
GanDuff: No worries, and no need for any apologies. I used to smoke plenty until I quit about 4 years ago. Still, somehow my nicotine tolerance disappeared over time, and now I can't do nicotine heavy blends; they just ruin my enjoyment of pipe smoking.

Pipes and vaping help plenty if you're looking to quit cigarettes, but do so at your own pace.

Thanks for the feedback. I'll definitely keep the blend in mind, assuming I can get a hold of it before it's all sold out whenever I decide to buy some tobacco, haha.

Cheers

chewsyourownadv: I can't very well be interested in occults and pass up on another gimmicky esoterically-themed novelty. It sounds yummy; I'll be putting in an order on Friday. Thanks, I didn't even know this was a thing.

====================================
SupraMario: Really enjoying that so many new blends still hit the market each year...time to put this on the list as it sounds fantastic. Nice review.
--
====================================
Bohater_: I'm pretty new to the C&D small batches put I'm pretty excited about this blend, does anyone know where I might be able to get a tin come Friday morn'?
--
inwithbacchus: I think this is online only so your best bet would be to camp Smokingpipes.com. I don't know who else has it in stock, unfortunately.
