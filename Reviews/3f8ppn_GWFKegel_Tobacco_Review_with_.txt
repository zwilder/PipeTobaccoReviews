Tobacco Review with Photos: Sutliff Frosty Mint

====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Thankyou, I have been trying to get my wife to quit smoking her menthol cigarettes, this could be a good substitute and a good introduction to pipe smoking for her .
--
GWFKegel: Totally. This tobacco feels a lot like menthols, but it tastes and smells much better, IMHO.

====================================
None: Thanks for the warning.

====================================
csobod: Yeah, I got a bag of this stuff a while back. Ghosted the shit out of a churchwarden I have within one smoke. Protip: if you really want to try it, dry the ever loving hell out of it before you pack it. It seems to reduce the ghost. I was able to clean it out, and after smoking straight burley in it for a while, I kind of neutralized it (especially in the stem, that's where it was the worst).

That being said, I have another semi-decorative churchwarden that I only bust out for the Renaissance Festival to complete my wizard costume. I've been blending it with this and that in tiny batches and letting it sit throughout the year, and I think that combined with the right aromatic, it will turn some heads (and noses) while I circle the festival grounds.

GWFKegel: Nice. Yeah, I couldn't tell if it ghosted my pipe much, but the stem I really noticed. Great tip!

GWFKegel: The text from the images:

##Sutliff Frosty Mint

It’s a mix of Virginias, Burleys, and Cavendishes, topped off with mint and a hint of chocolate. I couldn’t find any information about how the flavor is added, whether as a **casing** (the leaves are dipped or sprayed with the flavoring agent and allowed to sit or dry, resulting in a strong flavor) or as **flavoring** proper (a flavoring agent added toward the end of the process, often producing top notes, or something more subtle or shorter-lasting than casing). It’s a nice ribbon cut tobacco, full of deep browns and blacks.

##The Taste and the Burn

Mint! You have to *enjoy* mint, or else you’ll hate this. Seriously. The experience reminds me of smoking a menthol or clove cigarette. The mint is incredibly strong. My first bowl, that’s basically all I could taste. A few other bowls, and I could really begin to taste a bit of the chocolate, and a lot of the subtle sweet flavors in the Virginias and Cavendishes. Everywhere the smoke touches tingles—on the inhale on the tongue, on the exhale in the nose. The blend itself required a few relights each smoke for me, and it smoked a bit hot. But overall, it’s a decent smoking tobacco.

##Final Verdict / Recommendations

This is unapologetically aromatic. **The good news**: the room smells good when you smoke, and so does anywhere you store this tobacco. It’s also quite light on nicotine, so you don’t get the rush of harsher blends. **The bad news**: if you don’t *outright enjoy* mint, you will not like this. If you want more of the firewood, leather, or savory profiles, you should stay far away from this blend. 

So who should try this out?

1. If you love mint or strong aromatics, this is a must.
2.  If you’re more cautious about mint, but enjoy it as a note, this is a great tobacco to blend into things. I originally got this in a trade with /u/Chuzordie, which worked out nicely for me. I could have a few bowls without committing to a tin. Also, /u/PipeSmokingGal recommended I mix this with Sutliff Hearth and Home to get a sorta mint-chocolate flavor. I enjoyed that blend a lot too.

If you’re not interested in either thing, skip this one.

[Oh, the pipe in the photo is a little Bent Bob nose-warmer. I smoked this through a Missouri Meerschaum cob and a Peterson full bent, as well. I think the cob might have been my favorite, but there wasn't a huge difference.]
--
Chuzordie: Glad you enjoyed them.  My better half /u/PipeSmokingGal  will gladly share her recipe if anyone wants more information.
