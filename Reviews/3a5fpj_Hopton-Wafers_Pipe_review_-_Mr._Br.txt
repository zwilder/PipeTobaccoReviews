Pipe review - Mr. Brog 'chochla'
By: Hopton-Wafers

Okay, this is my first review, so those who're experts at this, please, be gentle.

I decided it was time to try one of Mr. Brog's budget pipes.

Taking advice from here and other places on the internet, especially all the warnings about (over) heating, I opted for the 'chochla' because of the thick bowl, and also because I think the design is interesting in itself.

Before smoking it for the first time, I used a 'tip grip' both to protect the end of the stem in general, and also because Mr. Brog's pipes are said to suffer from brittle stems. I also placed a metal screen net ball at the bottom of the pipe to try to help the pack breathe more easily.

The pipe also comes fitted with a filter, which I left in, not least because I don't really care for strips and bits of tobacco coming up the stem with the smoke.

Finally, using Frank's method - as best as I can do it - I filled up with Squadron Leader, a year old tin that may be a little dry but which smokes (in other pipes) just fine.

Impressions.

Pipe tip - bad idea.
The tip of the stem is so small that the tip didn't really fit well, and I was left sucking up more air than smoke. It may protect against reputed brittleness, but this pipe is not a 'clencher'.

Net ball - good idea
This was the first time I'd used one of these, and it seemed to help for an even and gradual burn, needing only one tamping and a relight after I had to take a break (intrusion of real life issue).

Pipe - good
The bowl, even as large as this, did get warm - and I tried not to puff away at it too much - but I found it a very comfortable pipe to hold in the hand. The draw was a very little on the light side, but it drew well enough overall, kept alight without needing attention, and smoked evenly down to the ash. In terms of size, it's not so heavy as it might look, the stem is a little on the small size, and the bowl is not as generously sized as it might be.

Overall
On a first impression, it smoked well, lasting me about half an hour or so, caused me no problems, and the filter didn't get in the way of enjoying my Squadron Leader. Whilst it's not about to supplant my MM cob as my favourite, but for sitting and enjoying rather than clenching and getting on with other things, I was quietly impressed. I certainly found it a good advert for Mr. Brog's pipes, and may well search out another in the future.

KanpaiWashi: Nice.  

One of my first pipes was a Brog Amigo.  Hated it at first because it smoked hot and developed this sour taste.  Then when I realized that not being able to fit a pipe cleaner through the shank was a bad thing, I redrilled the hole, and it's one of my better smoking pipes.

Hopton-Wafers: Redrilled the hole? How to do that? What tools for that?

KanpaiWashi: Yeah, I redrilled the shank hole using a regular household drill with a 5/32" bit.
