Review: C&D Golden Days of Yore

A while back, /u/TurnerJ5 posted a [joke contest thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3a1jok/golden_days_of_yore_a_contest_win_an_exclusive/), the winner of which would get some swag, including a bit of C&D Golden Days of Yore. I got one of the prizes; who knew that enemas were so amusing? Thanks, Laudisi!

Anyhoo, I finished the sample; here's my tale.

**Blend Name**: C&D Golden Days of Yore

**Description on ~~Tin~~ Ziploc Bag**: Golden Days of Yore ^review ^me ^:).  

**Leaf**: It's pretty, first of all. It's chunky, so the components are very visible. Visually, it lives up to its name. Lots of bright, gold Virginia, and I'm guess some of the golden coloring comes from the Katarini. It's mottled black with some Cavendish, and some other dark tones from the Kentucky. It was a bit moist on arrival, so I let it stay in the bag to dry. Over the course of a month or so, it dried to what I think is typical of other C&D blends I've had.

**~~Tin~~ Bag aroma**: It's hard to really nail down the sauce. I'm wanting to say vanilla and rum, maybe, but it's really mild. I can smell the Kentucky quite a bit more, and the Katarini has really got me intrigued. At this point, I'm actually thinking this could be a bad smoke for me, given my low tolerance for Kentucky. Spoiler: loved it.

**Taste**: I struggled on the first two bowls, trying to figure out what was in it, while instinctively shying away from the Kentucky. The sauce is pretty vague in the taste, but I'm sticking with rum/vanilla. The taste doesn't mask the tobacco, which seems to be pretty good quality, and like most aromatics the sauce disappears maybe 1/3 into the bowl.

Now, the weird thing about this is I'm liking the Kentucky. There are just a couple of blends that have Kentucky in them that I could abide, being Sextant and Sixpence. My palate is shifting, perhaps due to this blend, but maybe for the first time I can really get some good Kentucky flavors. It's not strong or overbearing, just distantly BBQ-like and with a hint of molasses.

Next, I like different Orientals and have been on a Drama kick for a while. So, with a blend containing a bit of Katarini, I'm just finding myself fascinated with that piece. I can definitely pick up the typical Oriental floral and oil notes, but it tends to weave itself in and out of this blend. This has got me wanting to try McClelland's Katarini Classic.

The Virginia and cavendish are a pretty constant note, a bit of bread and spice, slightly sweet. They make up the baseline that the Kentucky, Katarini, and sauce weave themselves around.


**Smokability**: It needs some dry-time. After letting it dry, the sauce was less pronounced, but it smoked much easier.

**Room note**: Beats me. I smoke outside. My wife never complained about it.

**Thoughts**: This is a complicated blend that I enjoyed picking apart, and it has possibly turned me on to some components (Katarini and Kentucky) that I haven't really thought much of, yet.

**Nicotine**: Pretty easy to handle. I've smoked this blend both on an empty and full stomach and didn't feel worse for it.

**Rating**: 3 / 4. 

**My background**: Pipes. I smoke 'em.

**Edit**: [About that topping...](http://s12.postimg.org/hf20ridr1/paul.jpg)
====================================
TurnerJ5: You delivered, excellent! Thanks for typing this out. Good review and I agree that it's pretty complicated for a holiday blend.

chewsyourownadv: > You delivered

NO U!

====================================
pylorns: Didn't I hear someone say... ginger?   I got a sample from Chris himself week before last and have had a couple bowls.. i'll say its good stuff but the first bowl didn't do it justice. The orientals I smelled from the "tin" note are great. 
--
chewsyourownadv: What, the topping flavor? I never heard/read anyone from C&D or Laudisi describe it.
--
pylorns: Chris Tarler and/or /u/hedonaut mentioned it I think he or /u/TurnerJ5  said something like " we smelled him making the sauce for months..."
--
hedonaut: He cooked it in the company canteen. All sorts of spices for weeks, test batch over test batch. The final product was good enough to drink with a spoon.
--
pylorns: But did you....
--
thesillyoldbear: I tried, but was quickly (and violently) discouraged.
--
====================================
hedonaut: Great review. It's certainly not your standard aromatic. It's pleasantly strong, too. 
--
chewsyourownadv: I enjoyed it, but I'll be damned if I can really define the topping taste.
--
hedonaut: Spices... lots of spices. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Edited my review to account for this.
--
hedonaut: THE PIPES MUST FLOW!
--
====================================
tennesseean_87: This sounds good. 
--
chewsyourownadv: It *is* good. Get ya some.
--
====================================
thats1hottooth: I was almost hoping for eggnog or GlÃ¼g (mulled wine)
--
chewsyourownadv: > (mulled wine)

Maybe this instead? I've had it, and while the tobacco itself is nothing special, the topping is alright: https://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/Sutliff/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=155440
--
thesillyoldbear: I think that was what they were going for originally, but it came out tasting of goddamn Cheerwine.
--
rkdc: Cheerwine is amazing in soft drink form - I think I need to try this blend when it comes out. If I can't get the soft drink out here in Narnia (aka the west coast) I should at least be able to smoke it. 
--
====================================
Mordenkrad: Honestly this sounds a lot like last year's blend "We Three Kings". but with less Cavendish and more kentucky; I wouldn't mind giving it a shot. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Oh does C&D do a yearly Christmas seasonal release?
--
hedonaut: We do, and it's different every year. There's also Mixture Monster for Halloween. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Cool! Is Mixture Monster the same every year? I just read the [reviews](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/9168/cornell-diehl-mixture-monster), so I'm wondering if that's what I would expect to see this year.
--
hedonaut: I believe it is, but the tins have different labels and are made in very limited quantities. It's a collectors thing like the old special glasses some companies used to do. 
--
====================================
lakerstud32: Great review!  Enough to convince me to order a tin.  On its way!
--
chewsyourownadv: Cool! I'm really curious what other people think of it. Maybe come back with your thoughts after you work through a few bowls?
