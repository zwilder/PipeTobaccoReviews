This should be the right blend to dispel all those [funny myths about English blends and Latakia.](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/faq/article/142/a-little-bit-about-english-blends-latakia-101)  I mean this recipe is at least 100 years old, and I’m sure it’s changed as the British Empire was [dismantled](http://i.imgur.com/FCOKhJC.jpg), but it’s very, very English and very, very Oriental-forward.  So all those Americans saying that English blends are Lat-dependent, please smoke up some EMP.

Also, Oriental is a stupid term.  We don’t call Virginia tobacco Occidental because it’s not 1800 any more and the line between East and West was never that clear to anyone anyway.  Balkan might be closer to reality but you can’t call it Balkan because of the marketing department at Sobranie of London.  Mediterranean might fit the bill except that a bunch of this stuff comes from Macedonia and it’s landlocked, dammit.  Turkey and the coast of Syria were really the only parts of the Orient that grew Oriental tobacco anyway, and a bunch of that was fire-cured and named after a port city instead of sun-cured and named after [academic shorthand for Western condescension.](http://www.amazon.com/Orientalism-Edward-W-Said/dp/039474067X)  This is how we end up using offensive and deprecated terms for things, isn’t it?  The whole curing method is the fault of the Ottoman Empire, blame them for losing control of so much of Europe and confusing the issue.  We can blame them for lots of things … I did an art history presentation on Ottoman pornography, and their tobacco is very mild by comparison.

Anyway, EMP.  Not [Electromagnetic Pulse](http://i.imgur.com/uW8YbvQ.jpg), which Wikipedia tells me is also called a Transient Electromagnetic Disturbance, which is a better acronym for a TED talk than whatever TED is supposed to stand for … images of white noise, scrambled brains, fuzzy logic and then poof, it’s gone off into the ether, never to be thought of again.  Also, unavailable in a Faraday Cage.  No, nothing about Early Morning Pipe makes me think it came from a nuke.  Named during an era when folks were more refined but also wanted a little bit more of a kick in the teeth first thing in the morning than a kale smoothie might provide, everything is in balance, everything in service of that Ottoman tobacco flavor.  It’s medium in taste and doesn’t deserve the mild label everyone hangs on it.  It’s mild in Latakia but the Turkish leaf would overwhelm without some Lat to calm it down. The taste of red Occidental tobacco is pretty constant, it’s there and it’s fine and necessary but it’s not what this blend is about … although if you smoke it hot you’ll lose all that flavor and the only thing you’ll be left with is a sour and hot Turkish bowl.  It’s medium in nicotine, maybe a surprise for such a gentle mix, but we can’t blame the Ottomans for that, probably it is the fault of the British, who don’t mind a punchy tobacco, in contrast to their incredibly bland national cuisine (not curry.)

Everybody who smokes a pipe encounters EMP sooner or later.  It’s got 450+ reviews on TR, but I almost never see people complain about this version vs. the last manufacturer vs. the one before, and so on to the beginning of recorded history.  They do that with MM965 and Nightcap, two of the three blends that have more reviews than EMP.  Maybe nostalgia isn’t as strong with Mediterranean-forward medium blends?  Lat-heads will harsh on it for being weak and bland, but I assume their tastebuds have finally given out.  Side note: the 7 blends, in order, with over 400 reviews on TR are:

* Nightcap
* My Mixture 965
* Full Virginia Flake
* Early Morning Pipe
* Squadron Leader
* Prince Albert
* Penzance

Three Dunhills, two Samuel Gawiths, one Esoterica, and Prince Albert.  I am making the [psyduck face.](http://i.imgur.com/5ryKVlg.gif)  

I popped a fresh tin of EMP before writing the review, and smoked it in a nice house pipe from [Edward’s in Englewood.](http://edwardspipeandtobacco.com/)  Briarworks is doing their house pipes now, they smoke pretty dreamy.  Kind of a perfect combination of pipe and blend, **four stars.**  If you’re looking for something with more artisan cred, Greg Pease’s Chelsea Morning is explicitly NOT an EMP match, but it’s like *A New Hope* and *The Force Awakens* … they both taste the same in the end.  You’ll get less static from your friends for waxing poetic about the Pease blend though, everyone takes EMP for granted.

corncobhobbit: Nice review, thoroughly enjoyed.

facestab: Best review I have read in a while. Thanks

WayOutWest: Great review!
--
pixeechick: Well. Now I want to see a duelling review between you and /u/antiwittgenstein . Please, please happen. 

Loved reading this. Well done.
--
None: Thanks!  He'd wipe the floor with me, all those off-the-wall flavor descriptions and the 10-point rating scale ... the duel would go something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/EClJOdi.jpg) without the tophats or the political career.
--
pixeechick: Ha! I think both styles bring something valuable to the discussion and exploration of a blend. I still want to see it. 
--
antiwittgenstein: I agree, /u/blindsamples has chops. I would be up for it as long as reddit has enough drive space to handle a double barreled blast of profuse verbiage.
--
None: It's like a tl;drfest!  /u/pixeechick is all ["Let's have a duel!"](http://i.imgur.com/lnh8uzK.jpg) (Those are actually Andrew Jackson's dueling pistols, just to keep everything topical with the previous image.  These things matter.)

Sounds fun tho.

====================================
WayOutWest: I'll start by saying I love Early Morning Pipe. It has been one of my favorite mixtures for the decade that I have been smoking. It's light, subtle, and simple. It's clear in other reviews that this is an issue for a lot of pipemen. For me, however, this is it's strength. It packs easily. It smokes so easily, so effortlessly, that it's hard to for it to turn on you. This is EMP's best quality, it's simple smoking mechanics. As much as I love a dense Pease blend or a rich Gawith flake, it's pure joy to pack a bowl of Early Morning Pipe, char light, tamp, light once more and forget about smoking a pipe while I smoke a pipe. 

Isn't this what you want for a morning English mixture? I mean it says it right on the tin, Early Morning Pipe. 

This is a tobacco for the beginning of the day, when blowing out your palate with a full flavored leaf is ill advised. This is a blend that you can puff on while you go about some chore or duty. This is a utilitarian blend to be smoked when the act of smoking your pipe isn't your focus. 

I can see why all the reasons I love Early Morning are the same reasons other pipers find it boring, lacking in flavor, or not worth their time. But I love EMP all the same.

4/4


Side note: just cracked a tin of Chelsea Morning which, other than the added perique, is supposed to closely resemble Early Morning Pipe. I'll edit my review with my thoughts on this comparison.

None: You should definitely update us on the Chelsea Morning - I'm super curious about other pipers' reactions to it.

crimblade: **Blend Name:** Dunhill Early Morning Pipe

**Description on Tin:** Sweet Oriental carefully blended with Bright and Red Virginias, pressed and lightly stoved. Great as the first pipe arousing the palate for the further pleasures of the day.

**Leaf:** Ribbon cut of a nice brown and tan leaf.

**Tin Aroma:** Pleasant with a nice sweetness and dare I say a hint of smoke.

**Taste:** A nice balance of sweetness and smoke without being a Latakia hit or really over the top in anyway. It has an interesting sour note that I can't decide if it's a plus or minus. 

**Smokability:** This blend is very smokeable at any time of day, it pairs extremely well with coffee which makes sense since this is considered to be a tobacco you'd smoke at the time of day you'd be enjoying a cup. 

**Room Note:** Not 100% sure because I smoke outside but I got a very distinct cigarette smell on clothing I was wearing afterwards. 

**Thoughts:** It's not surprising that EMP has been a staple of pipe smokers cellars for as long as it has. It's a good solid smoke and delivers consistently. But despite this I've found myself always going to something else when the opportunity presented itself for a smoke. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it has never been something that I would choose over anything else. Perhaps if smoking were an everyday event for me than EMP would make a place for itself but when there's so many more interesting and relaxing smokes out there I find myself hard pressed to make time for it. I think I enjoyed this tobacco the most when sipping a cup of coffee with it, which I did go out of my way to do just to get the full experience. Perhaps this will change as the weather warms and I find myself outdoors more often, I guess I'll see. 

**Recommend to:** Anyone looking for a good, reliable smoke. What EMP does well is give you exactly what you were looking for without having to try and detect it's subtle nuances of depth or flavor. 

**Summary:** EMP is good, it just doesn't stand out to me in any way, nor does it fill any void that is not already being better filled by a different blend.

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for a year and a half with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Mortons Cellar, White Knight, and Quiet Nights.

**Final Rating:** 2/4

====================================
eurotrashcan: **name:** Dunhill Early Morning Pipe  
**Leaf:** latakia, oriental/Turkish, Virginia  
**Tin Aroma:** savory smoky latakia, sweet woodiness, bready/biscuit, Christmas spices, leathery, floral, barnyard
Taste: at the start of the bowl I got a lot of hay and straw flavors. Towards the middle and especially towards the end I started getting a very pleasant biscuit taste  
**Smokability:** stayed lit extremely well with little babying. Even when I thought it should have gone out and I was getting ready to relight I was surprised to still find it lit.  
Room Note: Wife never complained so It must have been tolerable. I got mostly incense aromas from the room note and not much else  
**Thoughts:** I knew going into it that this would be a milder blend, which I don’t really appreciate fully right now. I think since I am only having a pipe about once a week I look forward to a full flavor punch in the face when I do sit down for a smoke. It’s a special treat for me right now so I'm not as intrigued by the mild flavored all day smokes. I know this is naïve and I am very possibly not giving the credit this blend deserves but I did still enjoy the subtle flavors EMP had to offer. The things I enjoyed the most were its smokability and the biscuit notes a got from the smoke later in the bowl.  
**Summary:** smokes easy, cool, light, and subtle  1.5/4  
**Background:** been just me and my cob for a little over a month now.

anxst: **Blend Name:** Dunhill Early Morning Pipe (Bulk)

**Description on Tin:** Sweet Oriental carefully blended with Bright and Red Virginias, pressed and lightly stoved. Great as the first pipe arousing the palate for the further pleasures of the day.

**Looks:** Mottled brown ribbon cut with a smattering of lighter and darker leaves

**Tin Aroma:** Pleasing. Moderate sweet virginias with an undercurrent of smoke and spice. Smoky and toasty. Reminds me of baking bread over a campfire in a way.

**Pipe Choice:** Freddy Prieto Nosewarmer

**Paired with:** Kona blend coffee with cream

**Age:** 2 ounces fresh from smokingpipes.com, jarred last week. It arrived with perfect moisture content.

**Flavorings:** None Detected

**Taste:** The orientals are the major note, with hints of smoke and sweetness joining in the party. It's flavorful, but without being overwhelming. Medium in body, medium in flavor. Retrohaling brings up more spice and smoke, but isn't something I advocate doing a ton with this blend. It strengthened the flavors, but didn't add much to them.

**Smokability:** An easy smoker. 2 lights for the whole bowl, and smoked down to white ash.

**Room Note:** Lightly smoky, seems a bit cigarette-ish, which is no surprise as the blends are composed of almost the same things in different proportions from what I understand. As usual I smoked outside, so room note observations are from my shirt and beard 45 minutes after I came in the house.

**Ponderings:** I like this blend. It does in fact wake the palate without being overwhelming. Made for a beautiful morning here in Minneapolis sitting on the front step, with the birds chirping as the day warmed. It's a thoughtful blend, in that it requires no attention whatsoever.

**This smoke is for:** Anyone looking for a simple smoke they could have all day that's quite balanced. People looking for an easy entry into English/Balkan blends. People looking to work on their pipe packing/smoking technique, as it packs and burns easily.

**Summary:** Overall I like it. Since it's not too pricy I'll probably always keep a few ounces around.

**My Background:** Smoking pipes for four years now, smoking cigars for almost ten. Favorite cigars: Drew Estate Liga Privada Unico L40 and Feral Flying Pig, Warped El Oso, and Crowned Heads Headley Grange. Favorite pipe tobaccos: Just for Him Shortcut to Mushrooms, Peterson University Flake, and McClelland 2035 Dark Navy Flake.

**Tobaccoreviews.com Rating:** 3/4

**My Scale Rating:** In the world of Clint Eastwood movies, this is In The Line of Fire. It's pretty good, it has its moments, but it's not The Good The Bad and The Ugly or Dirty Harry, or even The Outlaw Josey Wales, by any means. 6.8 of 10.

Jumile: As a new pipe smoker, I bought a tin of this based upon this review after trying a bag of Mac Baren 7 Sea Royal Blend (thinking that the raw smell correlated with the smoking taste or exhaled smell). The Mac Baren smelled beautiful raw, but like beer and coffee the consumption wasn't as nice as it smelled. 😄 

So tonight I tried Early Morning Pipe for the first time. Have to say I'm unimpressed with the raw smell - it's just not appealing - but the taste during and the smell after smoking is lovely. It's light, smooth and very pleasant.

Apart from these two, my only other experience with pipe tobacco is the raw and exhaled smells of the Three Nuns (black, orange and gold square tin; possibly only exists in Australia, as that's where I grew up) that my grandfather used to smoke. Loved that smell - the whole smell memory is probably why I got into pipe smoking in the first place.

Anyway, seriously impressed with this tobacco, so thought I'd provide some feedback. It being the second one I've ever tried, and all that. 😊
