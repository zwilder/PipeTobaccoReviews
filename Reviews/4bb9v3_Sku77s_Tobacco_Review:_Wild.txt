Tobacco Review: Wilderness by McClelland

Blend Name: 
"Wilderness Pipe Tobacco" by McClelland 

Description on Tin: 
	This remarkable blend formulated by Fred Hanna provides a multi-layered, rich taste experience. The highest quality Syrian Latakia combines with small amounts of Cyprian to form the base for an exquisite array of rare and precious Orientals - sweet Drama, exotic Yenidje, and more. Red Virginia's complement the blend, adding sweetness, richness, and creaminess. Smoke this mixture and listen for the echoes of savored memories. Dated 2'2013

Leaf:
Syrian and Cyprian base. Varied Oriental body with a Red Virginia topping a nice ribbon cut.

Tin Aroma:
Smokey Latakia and if you could imagine nightcap and margate had a love child. 

Taste:
 	Really the tin description hits this perfectly. Aside from the last line its a no BS description which really surprised me. The Latakia is just a base for the flavor to start before you go on a roller coaster of Oriental flavor. I didn't really taste the Virginia's but my smoke was definitely creamy so YMMV on that aspect.

Smokability:
 Easy light. Its a ribbon cut so I suggest the spiral method. Just sit back and enjoy there is alot of flavor to be had here. I suggest enjoying a couple times in a few pipes. This is a great blend to play with because you can make the flavor vary so much as the smoker.

Room Note:
	My SO "Didn't mind it" which means its not a favorite but not worth freezing outside as punishment. She often get burning rubber smells from lat blends which puts me in the garage.
	I'm not sure how to describe the smells provided by the orientals, I enjoyed them regardless. Almost like an incesnse but more exotic and tamed that what you would find in most churches. Followed by the smell of old books/paper that I find in Lat's alot. 

Thoughts:
 	I drove a while to a B&M and purchased 4 tins. Orignially this mixture had not made the mix. I'm a Va-Per lover who only flirts with Latakia. BUT the owner who is a generous and wise character said I would regret not buying this particular blend. It was this or St. James Flake. I hate to say, but I imagine he was correct because I regret nothing. Man knows his stuff.

Recommend to:
 	Oriental Fans over Latakia Lovers. And anyone who likes having a blend you have to smoke more than once to really taste all it has to offer. Also if you've had blends that have orientals in the mix but didn't really get the taste this is a good spot to start in my opinion to a more oriental heavy blend.

Summary:
 	A blend that surprised me so much it became my first ever review. I've always found orientals to be muddied by lats. This blend uses the familiar lat taste to really springboard the orientals to the spotlight. I imagine the lats might be aged before hand to stifle them a bit so I'm not sure cellaring would benifit this blend.

My Background:
 	3 years smoking a pipe, previous nail smoker. I sometimes enjoy a cigar. Tasted this in a briar, cob, and a clay.

Pandam: This is one of my favorites. I wish they sold it in bulk so I could just stockpile it.

Pipezilla: I wish they sold all tobacco in bulk. To me, it's strange that they don't.

crimblade: Thanks for the review! I have a tin of this that I'm saving to enjoy on a Backpacking trip I'm taking over Memorial Day weekend. It just seems appropriate for that.
