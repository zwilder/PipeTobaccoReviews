Tobacco Review: Stokkebye Luxury Twist Flake
By: ScowlingIntensified
---
**Blend Name**: Luxury Twist Flake

**Description on Tin:** N/A: bought in bulk

**Leaf**: Golden virginias swirled with black cavendish, pressed, topped, and sliced into flake.

**Tin Aroma**: A lot of unexpected sweetness here; the virginia and cavendish combined with the (very light) caramel topping create a slightly grassy note. 

**Taste**: Packing light and puffing slow brings the two tobaccos to life here. What you get is that lovely, grassy and earthy virginia being followed with the natural sweetness of the cavendish and a barely noticeable tinge of burnt caramel (in a good way). A lot of reviews claim to taste vanilla in this blend, but I've gone through 4oz now and in 3 different pipes did not detect any. The retrohale is one of pure virginian twang and that shiny caramel-like top that can sometimes taste a bit buttery, but not sweet.

**Smokability**: The flake came a bit moist, and I found letting it dry for a bit produced a better, cooler smoke.This is a slow and steady sort of smoke; working it too hot can result in a little bit of tongue bite. I also found this blend to get a little ashy about 3/4ths of the way through; a narrow pipe and some ash management helps. It produces a moderate amount of silky, unctuous smoke thanks to the cavendish. This blend does not seem to have much in the way of nicotine; as a non-smoker I experience no noticeable nicotine at all.

**Room Note**: A little sour but much more pleasant than a heavy lat or english blend. Definitely not an aromatic room note.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed this blend, but I can see it not being a favorite for some because of the top and it's aromatic leanings. It's a sweet, cool smoke that manages to feel full bodied without being overpowering. I think it would make a great daily driver for me personally, and prefer it to it's Navy Flake brother.

**Recommend to**: Virginia fans looking to try something a bit different and aromatic smokers who want a tasty blend should give this a go. I would also recommend smokers with wounded wallets, as the price is absolutely great for the blend quality.

**Summary**: A slightly sweet and overall pleasing virginia/cav blend whose price makes it worth, at least, a try.
My Background: I've been smoking and learning for about a year now. I've tried a pretty wide range of tobaccos from cheap aros to nightcap, and while I can't say I've found a favorite, my preferences lean away from latakia/balkans in all but a few blends.

Riquaphugee: Can you comment on how this compares to PS Luxury Bullseye Flake?

ScowlingIntensified: I cannot, but I'll get back to you in a week or so when I get my hands on some Bullseye.

Riquaphugee: As I need to get my hands on some Twist.

ScowlingIntensified: Let me know what you think! I really enjoyed the blend.

rwvolkl158: This has much more of an artificially sweet taste (mostly carmel) to me than luxury bullseye flake due to the topping.  IMO bullseye is a much more reliable goto where as I only pull out twist when I want something sweet that doesn't qualify as an aro.  

Both are still solid blends though, I'd highly recommend grabbing a couple ounces of these and luxury navy flake and if you don't like them at first let them age a bit.  I liked Twist way more after I left it alone for a few months even though it is my least favorite of these three.
