Dueling review with /u/antiwittgenstein. Be sure to check out [his review as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2yej5a/review_chieftans_islay_mixture_dueling_review/). 
**Blend Name:** Islay Mixture

**Tin Description:** *CHIEFTAIN’S ISLAY MIXTURE Limited Edition. Strong, full bodied, spicy these are the main characteristics to describe this tobacco.*

*Here is combine the classic taste of past times with today's art of sophisticated blending, the result being a pure delight for experienced smokers. The blend is based on a complex Ready Rubbed formula bringing together the finest Virginia, Kentucky, Burley and Black Cavendish. The full body of this tobacco is then enhanced by just a hint of Perique. The final mixture is then fermented for months in original Chieftain's Caol Ila Islay barrels a process that brings a wonderful smoky taste to the tobacco. Original - barrel - storage (Chieftain´s Caol Ila Islay)*

*Family: Scottish*

**Leaf:** Was springy, moist, and almost sticky on first opening. Shag cut, some stuck together indicating that it was once more of a cake. Browns from rich mahogany to cocoa. No visible discernibility between different leafs.

**Tin Aroma:** On first opening, the tin was thick with the aroma of Islay scotch. I have since dried the whole thing out to a near crisp.

Presently: boozy. Some brine, and a sweetness like honey on granny smith apples. This smells like a heavily cased blend.

**Taste:** 

Charring light: Hm. This is not as bad as I remember it. It's sweet and has a hint of dark-fired in it. I wonder if this is ghost from the Irish Flake that was in the pipe previously.

True Light: This one's hard. I'm not getting much out of it. The faintest whispers of a draw bring out some caramel and sweet hay. The retrohale is a bit harsh. There's no scotch left in this for flavor at this point, now that it's so dried out. The tin aroma is there, but there's not that flavor that /u/antiwittgenstein was getting.

Giving the draw a bit more pull I can feel a tingle rising, and I know that can only be the burn that put my tongue out of commission for two weeks last time we met. I back off and return to the gentle sipping I started out with. I gain some nuttiness, say, brazil nuts, but not for long.

As I progress through the bowl, I find myself getting bored. For the complexity of the leaf this should be much more interesting, but I am not tasting the perique or the kentucky that is supposedly in here.

I let it go out briefly and relit the bowl. I again got some of the nuts and a little brine on this light. There's a hint of vanilla in there. Maybe a little chocolate too at the end of the bowl.

**Smokability:** Packed light and fully dried out, it takes to light well, burns dry, and resists going out.

That said, I intentionally packed this into a small bowl with a big filter as the previous two experiences put me off pipes completely for weeks while my face healed. Not a fun experience. This time was better, and perhaps the extreme drying and filtration, along with super-slow smoking is exactly what this blend needs. For the experienced smoker, indeed.

**Room Note:** Straight tobacco.

**Thoughts** This tobacco should remain a limited edition. Without perfect cadence and perhaps heavy filtration, this will bite scorch and fry your tongue for little reward. It's not easy to smoke, offers little in flavor and may be downright harmful.

Given my adoration of a nice Islay, I really wanted to like this one, but I can't.

**Recommended to:** Masochists and other lovers of pain. Anyone who needs a quick lesson in not smoking to quickly. Filtered pipe users. Leathertongues. 

**Summary** This tobacco should remain a limited edition. Without perfect cadence and perhaps heavy filtration, this will bite, scorch, and fry your tongue for little reward. It's not easy to smoke, offers little in flavor and may be downright harmful.

I really wanted to like this one, but I can't. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FfJ89rGPc 

**Rating**

**0.5 Stars**. If it's the last leaf on earth, it's a gamble. At your own risk. 

- 5/5 - I'm going to cellar several pounds 
- 4/5 - Worth picking up a tin/a couple ounces 
- 3/5 - Acceptable to receive in a trade 
- 2/5 - If you're running out of tobacco, it's alright. 
- 1/5 - Only if it's the last thing at the B&M 
- **0/5 - Not even if it's the last leaf on Earth.**
====================================
antiwittgenstein: I think yours is meaner than mine. For some reason, that makes me envious.

pixeechick: Ha! I didn't want to be mean, but maybe somewhere deep inside I wanted to eke out some revenge for my tongue.
--
antiwittgenstein: I meant to be meaner, but I ended up liking most of what I tasted. It is a shame, as the negative half of my scale rarely gets used. I should do a bad tobaccos month so I can see what a ------ tastes like.

====================================
TBSA60: Sorry this tobacco hurt your tongue so badly you had to wait weeks to smoke again, that sounds awful! 

If I was you and had this happen I am not sure I would go back to it. Brave of you that is for sure!

Thank you for review, keep em coming reading them is so much fun, even if the tobacco is not.
