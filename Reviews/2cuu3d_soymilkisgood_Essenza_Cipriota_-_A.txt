Essenza Cipriota - Another Review

Because we don't have enough reviews of this one I'll throw my hat into the ring. I'll be brief.

Smoked In: Briar Bird Black Blasted Devil's Anse with Bakelite Stem

Tin note: That artificial candy scent you get from runts, nerds, gobstoppers, smarties, etc. Very strong and up front. Can't quite put a finger on it, but it's just that general artificial fruit scent. Not what I expected.

First light: Is this an English? Tastes like a topped Va with a tiny bit of lat. Nice fruity cereal type of taste. It's enjoyable, but not for the reasons I expected when I first decided to pack a bowl.

To mid bowl: You know what this reminds me of? I finally got it. Shisha like you smoke in a hookah. That's where Pie got the grape - it's that artificial grape that's in grape soda. Nothing close to an actual grape you get from a vine with seeds in it.

Summary: Tastes like a nice toasted wheaty piece of bread with a generous slather of grape jelly. Different? Yes. Good? Eh. 

Ratings are arbitrary. That being said, I'll give it 3 stars out of 5.
====================================
facestab: I've been holding off on my review until I had a another bowl. The tin description was so far off from the smoke that I thought there was something deeply wrong. But you got the same thing I did - this is an aromatic dressed in a cryptic tin description. I don't know how many stars I would give it but I had no desire to smoke a pipe for a few days afterwards.


note: Pie = /u/ChefPD

InfiniteHal: Just goes to show that not all English blends are lat bombs.

CovenantHeart: Interesting...I still haven't found the artificial notes that you guys taste. I got the toasted cereal flavor, though...I was thinking like toasted honey nut cheerios and smoking oak. Definitely get the VA.
