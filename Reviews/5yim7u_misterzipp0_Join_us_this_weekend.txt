We are launching the official review thread this weekend for the inaugural mystery review!  

For those of you that don't know what this is, we sent out 24 packages containing two different types of tobacco and the users have had a few weeks to try and determine what they are. We got some great prizes from smoking pipes.com and we will be ordering them on Monday, March 13.

If you are participating and have not PM'd me your guess before the thread goes up you will be in eligible for the prizes so don't miss out!
