Armentrout Pipe

Today I received my new Armentrout pipe, Brandy in shape, and all of the wait and anticipation was well worth it. I wanted to share with this community my new pipe, opinions, experience, and my long journey on obtaining a masterpiece from Nathan.

Dimensions
5.40 inches long
1.82 inches in bowl height
Chamber is 0.80 by 1.20 inches deep 
Weighs 1.80 ounces (52 grams)
The stem inlay is spalted tamarind.

The pipe has an amazing feel to it and is deceptively light. The pictures don't do it justice, sporting a nice dark coffee stain with a lighter, smooth contrasting rim. The sandblast job is beautiful, pulling out some very nice but subtle ring grains, giving it a nice soft feel in the hand. 

&nbsp;

Smoking this pipe is like a finely tuned machine. The draw is perfect, no gurgles or whistles, and the chamber is shaped very well; allowing me to pack the tobacco a bit tighter than I normally would with some of my other pipes. I am currently located in a very hot and humid location where I will need to use 4-5 pipe cleaners to keep the moisture in check; with my new Armentrout I did not need any. Lastly, the way it controls the heat is phenomenal, where unless I really push it, the heat of the bowl only registers as comfortably warm.  

&nbsp;

Working with Nathan via email was seamless. He responded very quickly to my correspondence and from start to finish only took a little more than three weeks to receive my pipe. I couldn't of asked for a better experience.

&nbsp;

Now the back story...
I first heard about Nathan Armentrout in October of 2012 when I was in Afghanistan looking to buy a new pipe. Late one night, I was browsing one my favorite online retailers and low and behold, there was one of the most beautiful pipes I have ever seen for sale, an Armentrout Bent Egg. Unfortunately, the internet  connection I was using was so poor, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to check out; only to be devastated that it had already been sold during my attempt to purchase it. I had been patient so long looking for a pipe that really stood out from the crowd that I for a brief moment, I thought I found the one; instead it would take nearly three more years before I would get my Armentrout. 

&nbsp;

About two years later, I discovered he had website and decided to send him an email and see what his commission fees were and about the possibility of having a pipe made for me. Nathan was very polite and told me his fees and schedule, though soon after the Army would have me on the road again; making me push dream pipe to the back burner.

&nbsp;

About a year later again, I send him email, still seeing if has room in his schedule and I luck out. I kept my request very modest, well hopefully, and asked for a pipe with little to no bend, sandblasted with an inlay that would contrast with the finish. After a few conversations we settled on the Brandy shape and the rest is history.

&nbsp;

If you're in the mood for a finely crafted pipe, I can't recommend Nathan Armentrout's work enough. I know I will be getting a few more added to my arsenal as finances permit. Thanks for reading.

bt40k: Thanks! I think over the past two days I had hit refresh on the USPS tracking number page at least 50 times. Though, despite its charming good looks, smoking out of it is a dream.
