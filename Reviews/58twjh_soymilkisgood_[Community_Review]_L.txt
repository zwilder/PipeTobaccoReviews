====================================
crimblade: **Blend Name:** Upvote (No. 8 Slice)

**Description on Tin:** Initially blended and pressed for a club, No. 8 Slice is a stout Virginia and Perique flake with added Burley. Spicy and complex with full flavor and a cool, even burn.

**Leaf:** Virginia/Perique and Burley, dark brown crumble flake that is just begging to fall apart

**Tin Aroma:** Dark Stone Fruit. Sweet and earthy, very nice.

**Taste:** Earthy, with a nutty bread spine. Occasionally a taste of dark stone fruit will slowly come in only to leave again. Almost no spice from the perique, only really noticeable on the retrohale. The after taste is a very nice fruit. with a hint of bready sweetness.

**Smokability:** This stuff is wet, when it arrived it was soaking wet. Drying for an hour does not seem to fully rectify the problem. Microwaving helps more, but it still seems to retain moisture in a way I've only ever experienced with Samuel Gawith blends. Constant relights needed. You do have to be careful with it since it is so eager to crumble that it can get too small and you end up with bits flying into your mouth.

**Room Note:** Decent, slightly cigaretty but fairly mild and sweet.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how I feel about this one. The tin note is amazing and instantly made me want to love it. But whether it''s due to my inability to get this to dry properly or find a packing method that works better for the crumble cake I just haven't gotten a great smoke out of this. On every smoke the bottom third of the pipe was dumped due to it being a goopy mess that wouldn't burn, or would scorch my tongue if I had tried. I got 4 ounces of this so my hope is that given a winter of aging it will become something delightful next spring. Maybe with fresh eyes I'll get the drying a packing down in such a way that this blend stays consistent. It has a medium nic hit for when it does play nice. I just smoked one last bowl before finalizing this review and it performed the best it ever has, which really makes me lean more towards this being a blend one must become intimately familiar with to really coax out it's true flavors. Time that I just haven't had yet, so it's entirely likely that in a years time my thoughts on this blend will have changed drastically.

**Recommend to:** When it tasted good it was a good VaBur, with a suggestion of perique. Good for people who want the VaPer experience without the Perique being a major player. I found it rather similar to sixpence at times which is a good thing.

**Summary:** This could be a great blend but I fear it's my lack of familiarity with it keeping it from being better. 

**Drink Pairings:** Caffeine free Diet Pepsi, something about it just really brought out the stone fruit flavor which were my favorite times of this smoke.

**Final Rating:** 3/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 2 years. My current favorites are Frog Mortons Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.

Epochelyptikal: **Blend Name:** Upvote (No. 8 Slice)

**Initial Experience:**  I'll cut to the chase, as most of the reviews here cover very well what my first oz of this was like:  Flat, bordering on flavorless.  Prone to gurgle with excessive dottle.  Too broken up and often clogging the pipe.

**Where I'm at Now:**  A full body with an excellent sweet/sour tang and slight pepper on the retrohale.  Relatively one dimensional, in that the sweet/pepper riding on burley body and mouthfeel stays from initial light to about the final quarter of the bowl.  Things flatten out after that, so I'm usually done.  But the first 3/4 of the bowl is so good I'm OK with that.  It has more body than most other VaPers I've smoked and I like that.  I'm not a big fan of burley forward blends, but the burley in this holds the VaPer up so well that the blend wouldn't be the same without it.

**What Works:**  As was stated earlier, the first oz of this that I smoked was pretty flat.  The pouch note and taste of the leaf when just nipped between the teeth was so good though that I was really hoping that there could be more in the smoke, too.  What finally did it was the dry time.  Pack a bowl the night before or even the morning before.  Let it chill out until the next day - late morning.  Smoke.  Enjoy.

I pack some of the bigger flake bits in the bottom of the bowl and then pile in the fully rubbed out granules.  The flake acts as the filter to keep the granules from clogging the pipe.  I tap the bowl to settle the tobacco in, gravity feed style.  Top up with another small pinch of the fully rubbed out granules and thumb that down very lightly - VERY lightly.  Whenever the flavor thins a bit I'll tamp (again very lightly) while drawing on the pipe.  As soon as that sweet/spicey flavor comes back that's where I'll stop until it's repeated again based on the recommendation of the flavor changometer.

Also, I've found that I can't even think about smoking this in Minnesota in the summertime.  With the humidity here in the 90%+ range it doesn't matter how long this tobacco sits out; it's going to be too wet and it's going to taste like steam.  Even if it's dried in advance and stored in a jar.  Smoke it with that much moisture in the air and it's over.  My mouth is going to pay for it, too...

Once the humidity drops down to a comfortable range, though - whenever a cold front moves through or when fall settles in - it's about perfection for me.  So sweet/sour it makes my mouth water during the smoke or even when I'm just thinking about what that smoke is going to be like.  I have a sweet tooth, so I realize this blend might not be for everyone, but damn...  It works for me.

**Similar Blends:** If you started with No. 8 Slice and took out the burley, then added orientals and latakia, you'd have Mississippi River.  I swear.  If I want an English version of this flavor base I smoke Mississippi River.  If I want a VaPer+, but hold the smokey, I smoke No 8 Slice.  I love both blends and both make me want to smoke too damn much tobacco for my pocketbook to deliver.

**Recommendation:**  Wait for drier weather, pack a bowl a day (or more) before, and give it another go.

EDIT:  **Final Rating:** 4/4

misterzipp0: Up vote (No. 8 Slice)

My first few smokes with this were lackluster, like 1 star flat.  I ordered 2 oz and 56g went in the jar but there was another 10g or so that stayed in the bag and they were the introduction.  Even though the moisture was right I just got nothing out of it, almost like smoking an aromatic with no topping, just a lot of hot air.

Today I cracked the tin that had 4 weeks of aging and I pulled out a nice piece of jerky.  The slices remind me of the underside of a Little Debbie brownie as they are very dark brown with some striations from the pressing.  The smell was earthy and as I began to cube cut it I kept getting McClelland like wafts of tang.
I let the cubes air out for 30 mins, then 15 seconds in the microwave (800 watt Cheapo takes 4.5 mins to boil 2 cups of water) and then another 15 mins to air out.

I gravity fed the cubes into a medium size bowl and capped it with some of the tiny bits at 2/3 full.  The bowl lit up nicely and finally provided me with *some* flavor!  The burley is straight cocoa dust, a very dry chocolate taste.  The perique is very sharp on the retrohale at almost wasabi levels of heat.  I'm having a tough time figuring out what flavor it provides; I can't discern any mustiness, dark fruit, or the usual flavors that come with the territory, just the subtle heat that's amplified on the retro.  The Virginias are earthy, bready and not too sweet.  They can bite you if you're careless on the relights.  At times they can take on a rusty cigarette like taste.  I want there to be more flavor in this blend but I simply can't find it. Sadly the further into the bowl I go the more apparent this becomes.

If you have the discipline to sip this very gently and allow a side stream of air you'll be rewarded with a very sweet smoke, imagine a sopapilla without the ice cream, slightly sweet with just a hint of cinnamon.  The downside is that the smoke will be so wispy that you'll chase the sweetness to get more volume and it will vanish.  I lack that discipline so I'll settle for the heavier smoke.

I wonder how old the blend was when it was shipped as 4 weeks tinned really brought this one up.  I want this blend to taste like a flourless Mexican torte but I don't know if it will ever get there.

Nicotine falls just shy of medium.  I smoke on an empty stomach 90% of the time and I've been smoking a lot of C+D blends lately so take that for what you will.

Colors tasted in this blend are manilla, rust, and dark brown.

Summary:  If Anniversary Kake and Burley Kake had a kid that went to a prestigious art school and received a liberal arts degree and sat down with you for a 45 minute conversation you'd have Upvote.  Enough substance to keep a conversation going but maybe that's because he couldn't convey himself properly.

 2/4 stars

givemeyours0ul: Repost from last week:.  
Finished my sample of No 8 Flake this morning. Been smoking it all week. 7 bowls, 4 pipes. None of them save the last impressed me in the slightest unfortunately.  

 I started with my VaPer pipe, three times. Never came together. Next the English pipe, just to try it. Next, my Demon Prince from Eldritch I'm still breaking in. I tried various amounts of rubbing and drying. Every smoke was lackluster, smoked hot AND went out. Flavor was monochromatic, all I got was raisins, and a hint of some spicier richer flavors in the retrohale.  

Finally I used a Meerschaum I've only smoked a few times which usually gurgles, I've been wondering if it's pressed as opposed to block, but I don't know how one would tell. The case says block but who knows.  

Anyway, I rubbed it all the way out, and let it dry about the same time I had been dying the partially rubbed leaf, meaning it was theoretically dryer, although AC was off and evap was running so atmospheric humidity was much higher. I codger stuffed it, fired it up and sat down to play a video game with some friends. I smoked it hot and heavy, much harder than in my briars and it responded beautifully. More dark fruit flavors, more spice, and surprisingly no gurgle. The dottle produced a fascinating Lakeland flavor,  but I've never detected a Lakeland ghost in this pipe before, did it come from the pipe or the tobacco? Very interesting. The only downside is that my fast smoke has left me with some tounge bite this morning.

I had written this blend off as not for me, the Peretti blends cost as much as the inflated esoterica prices people cry so vehemently about ($44 with tax for 8oz + shipping), and I couldn't get a good smoke out of it. Now I feel I need to secure another ounce or two and engage in further testing.

Follow up: Another redditor sent me a bit more of this. Very wet, seemed more like a crumble cake this time, but the aroma was the same. I rubbed it all the way out and let it dry, loaded it in that same Meerschaum. Unfortunately it was back to my earlier experiences. Was the pipe ghosted last time by something more delicious? Not much there for me, no body. I'm going to sit on the rest of my sample for a few months and see what happens. For now, more for the rest of you. Shoutout to u/supramario for the sample!

Current rating: 2/4

Edit: I forgot to mention, the new sample had A STRONG McClelland ketchup aroma, which is unsurprising as it's well know Peretti sources their tobacco from McClelland.
--
PhysicsNovice: Interesting about the Lakeland. I also thought I noticed it in their 333 blend. 
--
givemeyours0ul: Yeah, it was very strange. I sure welcomed some flavor at that point!
--
Epochelyptikal: It's my understanding that this particular blend involves sutliff somehow too, and although that may just be the pressing and slicing I was lead to believe some of their leaf is in there.
--
misterzipp0: I had read the same rumor as well.

====================================
crimsonrat: Yikes, kind of feel like the batch I had was the best one. I only have smoked the original, from 06/2014. Definitely better with the age on it, like most Virginia heavy blends.

On the tin note, I got the sort of dried fruit aroma with a tiny tiny pinch of a McKetchup scent. As far as smokability, the slices/cake rubbed out really easily, almost like a classic burley cake. I had no issues getting it lit and staying that way.

Taste is awesome for me. It is mostly Virginias, and I get some of the sweetness from them, but the perique seems to have gotten a little more subdued than I remember fresh. I could have just torched my taste buds in the past two years. The burley it there, but not strong, and it adds kind of a nuttiness to the haylike sweetness the majority of the blend has. 

I'll give it a solid 3/4. Maybe higher, depending on my mood. Definitely better with 2 years in a sealed jar. 
--
Mordenkrad: Its interesting, because I've tried some stuff from about a year and a half ago, your stuff from 2014, and this new stuff. They definitely fucked something up along the way.

It could just be the age, though. 
--
crimsonrat: Reckon if the availability of some of the leaf changed? I talked to a pipe restoration guy that's been around since the 70s, and I remember him remarking about all of the different leaves they did not produce anymore. Once the cigarette companies really got to hitting hard, a lot of the grades and less well known strains disappeared. That, and time, are why "remake" blends don't always taste the same, I think.
--
Mordenkrad: Could be. I wonder if one of the guys at Peretti would actually let us know if that's what went down. 

I'm actually wondering if they changed their secret big mac sauce that they treat all the burley leaf with. 
--
crimsonrat: Possible. How does the new stuff smell in the tin/paint can?

--
Mordenkrad: Pretty much the same as always, but my sinuses are a bit fucked at the moment so it might be user error.
--
SupraMario: When I ordered my latest batch of #8, they put in a note saying how they had a huge influx of orders and they had to cook up a brand new batch. I'm thinking most of us got this new batch and it's so new it hasn't even had time to rest yet.
--
givemeyours0ul: How did you feel about the batch you sent me? I know you said you really liked the blend in general.
--
SupraMario: TBH? New, like really really new. This is a blend I feel needs a month or two of relaxing to start to carry its flavor profile. I only have smoked a few bowls out of it, but jarred the rest, I'm thinking around Jan/Feb trying it again. 
--
givemeyours0ul: Sounds like a plan.

====================================
PeskyPrussian: **Blend:** LJ Peretti No. 8 Slices

**Type:** Virginia/Burley 

**Tin Note:**  Brown sugar, almond butter, some underlying tangy hay.  Generally pretty reserved.

**Cut/Prep/Mechanics:**
This blend is essentially a sliced crumble cake of which many famous blends are (Plum pudding, Miss. River, Penzance).  My issue with this sort of cut is that the result of rubbing out a flake is generally a pile of tobacco dust and chunks rather than a nice, easy to pack ribbon. When they arrived to me the flakes were still very wet. I generally like my tobacco on the dryer side, so I crumbled up a flake and left it out for quite a few hours before attempting to smoke it.  When I still found it moist on returning I decided to throw it in the microwave for a few seconds. Even then, keeping this blend lit was extremely irritating.  They must have mixed some asbestos or something with this because it is an enemy of flame.  In addition, this tobacco did have a tendency to bite me on relights and continued to do so regardless of how wet it was or how I packed it.

**Flavor:**
Before discussing any tasting notes or fanciful gibberish, let me say that in general this blend is pretty medium in terms of flavor intensity. The flavors are there, but they don’t jump out at you.
This tobacco reminds me of walking through an old barn with a woodshop inside of it. Directly after lighting I get a combination of fermenting hay, loamy wood, sweet but nutty grain and fresh sawdust. Dry burley notes dominate the early flavors, especially since I’m used to straight Virginia flakes.   As you get further down the bowl the Virginias start to poke out with some tangy red VA sweetness like brown sugar, toast and honey, getting spicier and more rustic as it goes.  The aftertaste reminds me of black pepper and coriander.
That said, the shocking thing about this blend is how variable it is in terms of flavor.  I smoked this in a variety of pipes and got different experiences.  The very best that I got out of this blend occurred when I smoked half a bowl of it and then left it for the following day (some call this “delayed gratification technique”).  When doing this, the flavors of the virginia and burley seem to integrate and mellow out into something simple but much more enjoyable.  When smoking it this way it tastes to me like a toned down version of SPC’s Mississippi River.  At worst (particularly in a tall, narrow bowl) there are some very strange almost chemical off flavors (detergent and wood varnish?) that dismantle what would otherwise be a decent subtle flavor.

**Conclusion:** 
Sometimes during the bowl it has a generally nice flavor, especially if you leave the bowl for a long time, but even then the flavor intensity is pretty light for a pressed flake. At worst, the strange flavors make this tough for me to smoke and as best it tastes subtly decent.  If I add in my general dislike of the cut and the fact that it isn’t terribly kind to my mouth it is difficult for me to rate this highly, particularly since there are other blends with similar flavor profiles which I enjoy much more. 

**Rating: 2/4**
