Blind Sample Review - from /u/blindsamples

Yesterday, a mysterious manilla envelope arrived in my mailbox from a fellow Coloradan. Though I didn't recognize the name or return address, I had a sneaking suspicion I knew what it contained.

My suspicions were confirmed, as out of the envelope fell a nice note from /u/blindsamples and a ziploc baggie of some sweet smelling brown leaf. The sun was setting as I'd just made it home from work, but I just knew I'd have to give it a shot, so I loaded up a trusty cob and settled down outside for a smokey treat. I took some notes as I smoked, and repeated the experience again this afternoon to make sure I had another chance to sample this tobacco. So without further ado, here are the results of my blind taste test.

**Bag Notes:** This tobacco smells like figs, prunes, or raisins. Not overpowering, I think it's minimally topped or cased if at all. Appearance seems to be  rubbed out flake, a bit moist. Not sure if /u/blindsamples rubbed it out himself to disguise the cut, or if it just comes "ready rubbed". Pretty dark brown, not a lot of tan or yellow to suggest brighter Virginia leaf or burley.

**Tasting Notes:** I don't think this is topped, has a very pure tobacco flavor. If there is anything it might be a little bourbon or rum. Definitely tastes Virginia based, if not pure Virginia. Sweet, but not too sweet, almost bready. Creamy, but not cloying. A background of stewed dried fruits, perhaps fig. Also some earthy notes, and a certain mustiness. Just a tickle of pepper in the back of the mouth and retrohale, I am pretty sure there's some Perique in here. Not getting any sense of Latakia or Orientals at all.

Mid-bowl develops a certain smokiness, reminiscent of oak or some other hardwood. An edge of creosote or charcoal, but not pungent like lat might be. This overlays the bready, musty sweetness. I think the Virginias are stoved or flue-cured, reminds me a bit of FVF, though I'm pretty sure it's not.  All in all, very tasty.

**Other Thoughts:** The nicotine content is medium to medium-high in my opinion. Not quite break out in a dizzy sweat, but enough to put a  lump in my gut by about 3/4 bowl. Room note is hard to gauge outside, but from what I can tell, it's a pleasant, toasty pure tobacco smell. Burns very well after about 10 minutes of drying, easy to light and keep lit with just a little tamping here and there. Seems to like the narrow chimney of my cob.

**Conclusion:** I am reasonably certain that I'm smoking a very nice stoved/flue-cured VaPer here. Mostly VA, not super strong in the Perique but I think it's there. Formerly flake or coin cut, but rubbed to be easy to deal with. Bears a striking resemblance to PS Luxury Navy Flake, but isn't quite it. Whatever it is, it's not in my open cellar, but it tastes great and now I want to know  what it is!

Thanks /u/blindsamples, this is super fun and I can't wait to smoke the rest of this bag!
====================================
None: Nailed it!  Your description of the flavors is fantastic :) 

I think it's heat pressed though, not stoved ... That is Wessex Brigade Classic Virginia, a pure red VA.  It reminds me of what would happen if you sent McClelland's Christmas Cheer to finishing school in England.  A much more immediately refined VA, I think, but not one I see a lot of press on.

Thank you so much for participating!

mtn_mojo: Ahh heat pressed! That's what was reminding me of ODF, that almost steamy quality to it. Awesome. Man, this is some tasty stuff. Could have sworn I tasted a little perique but I guess not. This might have just become my favorite straight Virginia! How old/aged was it? And did you rub it out or did it come that way?
--
None: Reverse order: it comes ready-rubbed, the tin was maybe 6 months old, and they make one with Perique that I haven't had a chance to try yet but this is just really well made red VA.

I was tasting all sorts of sun cured tobacco in Stonehaven too.  It's crazy how we taste ... like you can't taste wrong, nobody's going to tell you that you tasted a banana the wrong way or anything ... so something in that blend just hit your idea of what Perique tastes like.  Very cool.

mtn_mojo: Very cool indeed. I really like going in blind, really makes you concentrate on what you're tasting/smelling/seeing. Turns out I also really like heat pressed red Virginias!

I gotta tell ya, u/blindsamples, this is pretty a interesting and fun idea to say the least.
