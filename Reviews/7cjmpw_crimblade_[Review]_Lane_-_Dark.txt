[Review] Lane - Dark Red

**Blend Name:** Dark Red

**Description on Tin:** (From SmokingPipes.com) Lane Limited's Dark Red is a rich Cavendish blend that offers a unique balance of cherry and vanilla notes for an irresistible smoke.

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish. A very consistent dark ribbon.

**Tin Aroma:** Dark Cherry nice vanilla smoothness. 

**Taste:** Initially very nice vanilla cherry, which quickly descends into a somewhat sweet smoke taste. The cherry vanilla comes back occasionally, and only if you've been sipping gently. I'm not sure I get any caramel, I might but the flavor is so short lived anyways who really can say?

**Smokability:** I got it in bulk so it might be different from the tin, wait can you even get this in a tin? If you can don't bother it's not worth a tin price and I'm not sure why you would age it. Right back to smokability, it's damp, like damp damp, like the kind of damp you get between your toes when you've been hiking with wool socks on all day. You know the damp? Where you step in a puddle and your foot goes squish all day? Well at any rate it's damp. The trouble is that the more you dry it, microwave it, the more the flavor diminishes. So you really run a fine line between damp flavorful tongue bite and subtly flavored smoke and no tongue bite.

**Room Note:** Vanilla cherry, really delightful.

**Thoughts:** I'm not an aromatic lover. I'm really not, I got an once of this on a whim and really enjoyed it initially, got a couple more ounces and now very rarely revisit it. I often revisit it as an add on to other blends. For instance a pinch or two in FMC and you have yourself an old fashioned. A pinch with the brown bogie and you have cherry induced coma. You get the idea. Basically I love it for what it can add to a smoke since in the short moments you'll get the flavor it will be there, but on it's own, well it's mostly a practice in hoping for just one more taste of that soft cherry sweetness. It has an incredibly mild Nicotine content, I'm not even sure there is any nicotine content really. 

**Recommend to:** I dunno someone who's looking for a cherry aromatic that's pretty tasty for 5 minutes followed up by an eternity of wishful hope.

**Summary:** It's a cherry aromatic, you get what you'd expect.

**Drink Pairings:**  I really don't know, Whiskey's ok with it but I mostly stuck to milk as a prohibitive to tongue bite.

**Final Rating:** 2/4 (only because it's a nice add on, if not for that it'd be lower)

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp, Quiet Nights, and Dark Plug.

crimblade: *Disclaimer:* I hope you're happy /u/antiwittgenstein? I'm reviewing  aromatics I don't really care for now. WHY AM I DOING THIS?!?!
--
antiwittgenstein: Yes, yes I am happy. Not just by your suffering. But it is important to review the bad or just meh stuff to warn off the rest of the hobby from underperforming blends. Thank you for your sacrifice. 
--
crimblade: I definitely agree about reviewing the meh/bad blends. My problem is that I tend to only smoke blends enough to review when I enjoy them. So this push was nice for potentially clearing some thoughts out on other blends that I haven't touched in some time.

====================================
HandsomeRalphy: I did not enjoy Dark Red by itself. I do however like it mixed with another vanilla aro (1-Q, MacBaren Vanilla), and some burley.
