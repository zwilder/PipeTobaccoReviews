Tobacco Review: Gawith Hoggarth and Co. Brown (Happy) Bogie
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 64

**Blend Name:** Happy (Brown) Bogie

**Description on Tin:** This Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. dark fired and dark air cured Twist is also known as Happy Bogie. This brown twist is actually a bit stronger than the black twist and is made to slice into coins for smoking, or small plugs for chewing - as done by many sailors.
 
**Leaf:** Curled deep brown rope about ½” (13mm) in diameter. Looks like a warped cigrarillo.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Faint. A little earth maybe.
 
**Taste:** Spicy and hyper earthy. Rain on dry soil. Reminds me a Padron cigar. Intense burley mouth. I feel like Kris Kristofferson sounds. Rich, coffee and cocoa, deeply peppery. It is like I crumbled up a cigar and put it in my pipe. Oh so slightly sweet. There is almost a vanilla quality to it. But the king here is burley. It is a big ole Studebaker of burley riding on a Sunday afternoon. Very flavorful, dark and still creamy chocolate. The pepper is big too, pepper with a fruity edge, almost Perique or stoved Virginia. Earthy as anything you will ever find in a cigar, the darkest maduro. Very consistent through the bowl and from session to session.

**Nicotine:** Instant pipe-drunk. Eat a full dinner beforehand. Have some desert. Still sit yourself down because the ride is pretty hard. I usually smoke this in small bursts, 10-20 puffs, till I get a hiccup, then I let it go out, so I don’t pass out. The strongest thing legal thing I have ever smoked.

**Smokability:** Uphill both ways through the snow. Hard to dry out, easy to get too dry. Doesn’t light well, goes out. You have to be extra careful not to crush too hard with the tamper.
 
**Room Note:** Rich tobacco. Heavy and thick, again like a cigar. You might want to smoke this one outside if you have the option.

**Thoughts:** /u/bonehead sent me to this to me about a year ago (Thanks again!) I believe in response to the [Haddo’s Delight review](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2rx5ze/tobacco_review_gl_pease_haddos_delight/) I did, in which I commented on how cigar like the experience was. This was indeed more cigar like. I would say it is more a cigar like experience than many cigars – I am looking your way Connecticut wrapped air sticks. 

The other salient aspect of this tobacco – besides it being a rope – is how mind erasingly powerful it is. I have just now, after a whole training montage and a litany of burley reviews, gained the tolerance I need to withstand a half a bowl of this stuff without having to eat a fist full of sugar and lay down. If you aren’t sure about your ability to handle stiff smokes, well maybe pass on this one for awhile – or use it as a goal. Contrariwise, it might be a great blend for anyone looking to kick their three-pack a day habit.

It is hard to smoke. It has turned me green a number of times. But this is an intense, flavorful tobacco, as big as burley probably can get. I won’t recommend everyone go out and get some of this (it is hard to find right now anyway), but I would suggest those of you on the tobacco pilgrimage, you ought to stop by Brown (Happy) Bogie. 

Also thanks again to /u/CHHolmes who also gave me some of this.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Padron cigars, most full bodied Maduros, Haddo’s Delight, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop

**Summary:** A cigar masquerading as a rope tobacco with enough nicotine to put all of Cleveland to sleep.

====================================
peckerbrown: This is my all-day smoke...lovely, no nonsense stuff.
--
antiwittgenstein: All day? After half a bowl of this stuff I am in a coma...
--
peckerbrown: Yeah, I'm kinda weird that way.
--
====================================
Terence_McKenna: Awesome review as always... you have definitely piqued my interest.
--
====================================
SupraMario: This and Irish X i keep saying...Pass...the vitamin N is going to murder me lol, nice review though
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! Yeah, if you feel hesitant in the least you should stay away unless you need an otc stomach pump. 
--
SupraMario: Lol yeah my tolerance for it is not exactly high 
--
levins0: I'm a lightweight with nicotine, but this stuff really is delicious. I usually wait for a nice weekend in the summer when I can smoke it after lunch in a cobwarden in my hammock until I pass out.  :)

--
SupraMario: If I could just pass out or enjoy the buzz like I do with scotch or beer I'd be all over it, but the buzz I get from nicotine makes me nauseating, gives me the sweats and makes me want to puke. 
--
levins0: Ah, that's not so happy, then.  :(
--
SupraMario: Yeah it sucks, it's like I'm getting nicotine poisoning or something.
--
====================================
carnesy: I haven't had this one but can handle BLIX pretty well. BRIX though... that's a devious one. Smoked cool and fine and tasty like with out issue for about 20 minutes or so, then as I'm driving I suddenly feel 3/4 out of body and not quite woozy and not quite sleepy but some combination of both. If HBB is same or more so then we need to get the industry to add warning labels not to drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how BRIX/HBB will effect you.

EDIT: BRIX= Brown Irish X

BLIX= BLack Irish X
--
antiwittgenstein: Man BRIX had me swimming - it was the strongest thing I smoked before the Brown Bogie. I have BRIX I mean to get to soon and I am suddenly scared. You are right about the warning labels, but as a rule I don't smoke before I have to do anything important like drive or appear in court.
--
====================================
crimsonrat: How strong is the perfume with this one?
--
levins0: Extremely light if you can taste it at all. I can send you a bowl if you want to try it. 

--
crimsonrat: I'm good, and appreciate the offer. I trust both of yall, but I'm still gun shy. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Non existent otherwise I would have thrown it out my window at the first orphan who wandered by.
--
====================================
None: So I'm interested, it usually takes a LFD 700 to make me dizzy, do you think I could handle the bogie?
--
antiwittgenstein: Probably at that level you will be fine, but I am not quite sure tolerance is always one to one, since there are differing rates of absorption and decay, etc. However, with that level of cigar nicotine tolerance I wouldn't be scared off from even the ropes. Yet, sip slowly as always and watch your gills.
