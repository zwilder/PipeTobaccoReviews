Review: Bell's Three Nuns (Mac Baren revival)

**Blend Name:** Bell’s Three Nuns 

**Tin Description:** None Nicer. A blend of dark fired and sun cured tobaccos mixed with the finest Brazilian Lights to produce the unique flavor and mellow smoking characteristics for which Three Nuns is famous.

**Leaf:** Kentucky, Virginia

**Appearance:** Slightly rubbed out coins with a lighter exterior and slightly darker centers.  

**Tin Aroma:** Hay, grass, and a slight sweetness that reminds me vaguely of dark stone fruit. I like the tin note - well balanced and pleasant. Maybe it could have been a bit sweeter, but the earth tones are decent as well. But it’s the smoke that will ultimately determine its taste.

**Taste:** I have to admit it’s not as great as I had hoped. There is a slight grassy and nutty note with hints of sweetness. I really wonder what this blend was like with its original Perique formulation. I think the pepperiness of the Kentucky is a bit different than that of Perique in a blend like Escudo. I guess it’s a bit stronger in a way, but it has an altogether different character. Sweet, spicy, and a bit nutty, but all in mild amounts. I wish there was a little bit more depth of flavor regardless. 

**Strength and Nicotine:** Decent nicotine kick. Won’t kick you in your teeth, exactly, but it’s there in nice quantities. Enjoyable strength – not too much, not too little.

**Smokeability:** Good flavors that work well together, if not lack a little depth and melding of flavors that would probably improve with a few years in the tin. But enjoyable and definitely potentially a usual blend for me to pick out to smoke. Wouldn’t consider it an all day smoke or a special occasion smoke, but somewhere in the middle. I’d have to be in the mood for this.

**Room Note:** Fine room note that is neither offensive nor especially pleasing. On par with other Va Flakes and such. 

**Thoughts:** An very nice Virginia/Kentucky blend that I would reach for again. Not my favorite blend in the whole world, but it is pleasant to smoke certainly. I don’t smoke many blends with Kentucky in it, so this is one of my rarer experiences with the leaf. I think this blend would benefit greatly with a bit of time to age in the tin. I am itching to try the original VaPer version to compare tastes!

**Recommend to:** A Va smoker who likes a little extra punch in their tobacco. Someone who wants to try new versions of old, fabled blends. My grandpa. 

**Summary:** A nice tobacco blend with some good flavors. Good display of what a Va and Kentucky blend can bring to the table. But I’m going to probably let a bunch sit in the cellar for a bit to age. 

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a few months ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and have been receiving gratis Sutliff products in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is one of many that I'll be doing as part of the program.

====================================
tochrais: I'm always bummed out when someone isn't blown away by a tobacco they review. They can't all be amazing though I know.

None: I actually liked this tobacco the more i tried it. Also, it helps to go slow with smoking it. The taste really develops as the bowl goes on and becomes quite delicious.
