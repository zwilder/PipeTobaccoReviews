Review: Cornell & Diehl Bijou
By: PastorPuff
---
Component Tobaccos: Virginia ('03 vintage) and Oriental (Katerini)

Flavouring: Honey

Cut: (Broken) Flake, it's advertized as a flake but good luck getting a flake out unbroken.

Tin Note: This smells like a fresh-cut lawn with the delicate scent of honey wafting over the top. It's delightful.

Body: 4/10

Strength: 3/10

Nic: 1/10

Moisture From Tin: Slightly on the wet side

Mechanics: For a flake this burns surprisingly well, even with it being slightly wet. It can burn hot if you aren't careful.

Taste: At first I don't get any Virginia, just the subtle sweetness of the honey. The bowl begins to taste faintly of curry spice and there is a mouthfeel similar to perique. The Virginias are not very prominent, I can taste them and their bright, grassiness but they are not upfront. There isn't much evolution through the bowl. It's curry, honey and grass all layered together. 

Thoughts: There really isn't too much to say about this blend. It is interesting, Bijou has flavours I have not found in any other tobacco: Honey and curry, mixed with the very familiar bright VA. And I cannot decide weather I like it or not.

Overall: ??/10

Additional notes: So I was curious about the 'curry' flavour and began to look into the profile of Katerini, the oriental that is in Bijou, and found that's where the curry flavour is coming from. It's interesting.

====================================
wheelman406: Great review. I found mine reminiscent of an old bread loaf starting to turn...
--
givemeyours0ul: I've never had bread "turn", unless you mean turn colors. 
--
wheelman406: That's it, particularly moldy colors.
--
givemeyours0ul: Ah, I see what you did there. In that case, I also had some bready Bijou. Took a month plus in the jar though. 
--
wheelman406: Mine was straight out of the tin, right in the center. Actually smoked a bowl first, then noticed while jarring. Replacement should be here tomorrow, though. Laudisi was right on it, no hassles whatsoever.

====================================
wayward_midland: I happen to have some of this in my cellar, but u haven't smoked any yet.  The curry note is very intriguing, I'll have to move this up in the queue. Great review!
--
PastorPuff: Thanks! I've smoked about half a tin and still can't decide if I like it or not.

====================================
pipegrouch: Interesting the smokingpipes link you give says it should peak at 10-15 years? Never heard of tobacco peaking. Wonder where they're getting that number from. 
--
PastorPuff: Says it on the tin too, it may just be marketing buzz.
