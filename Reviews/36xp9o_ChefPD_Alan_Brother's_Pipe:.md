Alan Brother's Pipe: Mini Review
By: ChefPD
---
How does it smoke? Perfectly well, as it should. Passes a cleaner, stem/shank have a flush fit, shaping is symmetrical. I think for this line, that's all obvious, though.

Perfect cross cut complemented by a crisp blast. Beautiful stain, comparable to Jeff's main line of pipes - this color combo is called midnight, simply a black blast with oxblood accents. 


Very comfortable pipe both in mouth and hand. Lightweight and easily clenched, or held, and I choose to "claw" this pipe with the shank on my middle finger and my index wrapped around the shank. Superbly thin bite area and a great button make all the difference to compose a comfortable pipe for me, and this has both. 


Speaking to this shape specifically, I've seen a lot of comments critiquing this pipe as a standard, boring billiard. I don't find this to be a standard billiard, nor is it boring, even in its simplicity. It's subtly stylized and if you're familiar with J Alan pipes, recognize able as such. A hint of Danish and a hint of American sets this, to me, far away from your Dunhill billy. It's really all in the angles, and maybe it takes holding one to understand what I mean. 


I won't really dive too much into price point, as there aren't too many options to compare this to. Owning three of Jeff's main line pipes, I can say it's a formidable value in the pipe marketplace. I do absolutely recommend this pipe.


The only two things I've noticed that I would change - the stamping was placed a little too far to the right and creeps into the blast where there was space to make it center, and the stem is acrylic. I understand the decision to go acrylic, but it's not my preference and fortunately the comfort of the stem makes up for it and I barely notice once I'm clenching. My reasons for preferring vulcanite are predictable, comfort being the big one, and hue saturation being second. 
To conclude what I meant to be a much shorter overview, very nicely done @alanbrothers [xposted from instagram]. This is a pipe I would buy again and happily recommend to other pipe smokers.

====================================
mile_high_me: Oh man I cannot wait!!!! I got my shipping info this morning so sometime next week I'm hoping. Thanks for all the reviews and pictures you put on here. This will be my first "new" pipe. All of my others have been gifts or ebay/antique store find. I'm way more excited than a 43 year old man should be.

ChefPD: Absolutely, and no reason not to be excited, I think you made an excellent choice for a first new pipe. I wish I had known the same thing when I started. Congrats!

Comintern: I don't know how anyone can be upset by a billiard. It's *the* pipe shape. It's simple and elegant.

Comintern: Also thanks for the review. There's a lot of options in the semi-artisan market right now with J&J's Sierra line, these Alan Brother Pipes, Wayne Teipen's Heritage line, Clark Layton's sloth pipes. I'm having a hard time deciding what to get.
