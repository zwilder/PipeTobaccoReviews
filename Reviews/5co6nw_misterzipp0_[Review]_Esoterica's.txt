I received this blend in a trade and I had a tin in my cellar already so I figured this was a good time to crack it open. I grabbed my trusty half dollar and slid the coin under the lid and heard the familiar hiss and was greeted by the aroma ofâ€¦ Olives?

Once the initial blast of olives was over the familiar scent of perique came through. The smell of this blend reminded me of Mac Barens Mature Virginia. It also has a similar red wine/olive topping to it but the similarities between the blends end there.

The cut of this one is very unique. The blend is pressed into slices and then fully rubbed out so you are greeted with long tan strands with a bit of mottled black.  It is a bit moist so I left this out to dry for a few hours while I did some work around the house.

I grabbed a plug of this and shoved it in my Sav 320 and lit up.  I overpacked it a bit because the strands spring to life like a cheap black fireworks snake.  After a few lights things calmed down and I could get into this one.

The first taste is of the mixed Virginia's which provide a hay/bready taste. The perique shows up very quickly and goes back and forth between a hot and spicy taste similar to cinnamon and Cayanne pepper.  The Virginia's are a great background for the perique as it transitions from spicy/hot to a bit of mustiness and some occasional chocolate.  It is not as chocolatey as Anniversary Kake and it does not show up much but it pokes through sometimes.
The mustiness is amazing! It is more of a damp earth taste than a wet basement. Imagine walking to your deerstand in the morning as you walk through the forest and get to the edge of a cleared hay field while eating some red hots.  When this one is on it's on!

The end of the bowl is plagued by re-lights and it can get a bit hot if you push it but not near the level of fussiness and sipping that a flake requires.

The room note is not great, however. This one went with me to run some errands and when I came back to the truck it smelled like a construction worker had been smoking Marlboro Reds in there while I was gone. I finished this one off in the house with a chicken in the oven so hopefully the wife won't be able to tell.

Colors in this blend are red, green, grey, and tan.

Nicotine is fairly mild.

This blend is not as hard to get as some of its brothers and sisters in the rest of the Esoterica line so you should have a better chance of snagging some when it pops up.  If you are a VaPer fan I highly recommend giving this one a shot.


====================================
lightningserpent: Is it good enough that you would buy another tin or would you move on to something else?

nita_losa: I just recently got to try this for the first time also, thought something was wrong when getting cinnamon. This is so good I'm gonna buy all I see, it moved to my 3rd fav VaPer.
--
misterzipp0: I'll have to give it a few more smokes before I can make that call.  There's so many VaPers I haven't tried yet.

====================================
majkeli: It's much better with some age on it.  I like it with at least two years.

====================================
Ifuckinglovepron: Imo it is very very sweet.  Has that sweet topping all of their VAs have.  Not a bad thing, just different.

I prefer Elizabethan Mixture as a more pure VaPer, but that is just me.  I found Dorchester quite similar, but much more peppery.
