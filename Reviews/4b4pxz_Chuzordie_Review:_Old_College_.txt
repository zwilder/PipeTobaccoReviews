Review: Old College by C&D
By: Chuzordie

**Blend Name**: Old College

**Description on Tin**:  Since mine came in bulk for the Smokingpipes.com description states that Old College is an outstanding blend of Latakia, Black Cavendish, Virginia, and Burley. A well balanced and surprisingly smooth taste for you and a delightful fragrance for the crowd. 

**Leaf**: Latakia, Black Cavendish, Virginia, Burley

**Tin Aroma**: A bulk order so no tin, but the bag note is shifted slightly more to the latakia and the burley.. smokey earthy sweet

**Taste**:light and flavorful, the latakia is present but not overpowering and I would consider it a good introduction into it.  To me this feels like a lighter version of MM965 with the orientals subbed out for more burley.

**Smokability**: I can smoke this all day without getting tired . Takes to a match easily with no detectable bitterness on relight.

Room Note: pleasant, lightly smokey

Thoughts: In a cob this is easy going and delightful,  in my briar bulldog, which is rather shallow compared to my cob,  it seemed to be  a bit smokier with more earth tones. 

**Recommend to**: a narrow bowl with morning coffee,  I see this as a non offending introduction to  an american english with the virginia and cavendish being there as a guide for those getting there feet wet in the nuttiness of burley and the caress of latakia.  Epiphany from C&D might be a big brother to this blend imo being that its lighter in the nicotine hit to me than Epiphany and Star of the East.

**Summary**: If you want to get started with a mellow english then try this one.

**My Background**:  Pipe smoker for about 2 years, lover or burley and chaser of the perfect english.

tittleton: You mean "caution"

FullFrontalNoodly: Heh, that is probably a more appropriate warning.

carnesy: Grabbed 3 ounces each of Poplar Camp and Bayou Morning with my last order. Should be here Monday, just wish I knew when those batches were made up so I can gauge when they'll be mellow enough to smoke.

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the write up. Any similar blends to this? Or how it compares to some of the touchstone Englishes out there?

Oh, and how is the nicotine?
