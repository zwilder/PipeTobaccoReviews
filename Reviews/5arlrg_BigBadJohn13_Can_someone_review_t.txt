Can someone review tsuge tobacco?

I'm looking at both the Four Seasons series and the Gods series, but would like some of your opinions on what's good and what sucks with this tobacco as I haven't heard too many opinions on it. Thanks!

Edit: This is exactly the type of feedback I was looking for. Thanks Reddit for not letting me waste my money.

Zapotecorum: I have some Tsuge Gunjin. Its not bad, very heavy on the orientals though. I bought it to get a better idea of what orientals added to a blend without latakia. But not something i smoke everyday.

Would i recommend it? Only if you're really into oriental/turkish tobaccos. Otherwise pass this one up

soymilkisgood: Don't waste your time. They are all bad to mediocre.

BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: I tried all of the 4 seasons and was highly unimpressed.

luthiermark: Based on the descriptions, I was really looking forward to trying them.  I bought one of each as soon as they were released. I tried 3 to 5 bowls from each tin, and was thoroughly disappointed & unimpressed with how mediocre they all were. I ended up giving the tobacco away (but keeping the tins for the fantastic artwork).

I realize that's not a blend-specific review, which is what you're looking for, but if I were you I'd save your money. There's not a winner in the lot.

ColinOnReddit: Sweet. Got a review?

givemeyours0ul: The tins are beautiful. As I said I haven't gotten around to opening them.

phonkubot: I have The First Days of Spring. Quite an understated aromatic to me with a gentle, almost floral taste. FWIW I enjoyed my tin so much, I bought another to cellar. I usually prefer English/VA/per blends so I was pleasantly surprised.
