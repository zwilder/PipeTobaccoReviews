**The Review**

I received my pipe roll about a week ago and have had the pleasure of using it while moving.  This consisted of many trips back and forth moving stuff, so it saw a good deal of use.  

The roll has a canvas outer with a softer, cotton lining on the inside.  The inside has a pocket for a healthy amount of pipe cleaners, a pipe pocket, a tobacco pouch laminated with vinyl, and a small pocket behind the tobacco pouch for lighters/tools.  It comfortably holds one pipe (pictured is my Savinelli pot), but you could possibly fit two if you don't mind the roll being a bit bulky.  A handy flap covers the cleaner and pipe pockets when rolled up.  When everything is rolled up, it is secured with two leather laces that can be cinched around themselves.  This offers a simple, yet classy design that allows easy adjustment for whatever size the pipe roll ends up being with your chosen contents.  

The quality is top-notch.  The stitching is solid and straight and the outer and inner lining look like they'll hold up for many years to come.  Comparing the price-points and quality of other pipe pouches, honestly, I believe this is worth more than the $59 price tag.    

For my needs, I can't be any happier.  It's the perfect size for an afternoon away from the house or even a weekend outing.  Form and function are spot on, and I've already recommended this roll to several of my friends, so I have no remorse promoting it here!


If anyone has any other questions about it, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer!


====================================
NiceAsShit: Personal it's got to be leather for me.

mile_high_me: Just curious as to why? Is it a strength thing? Appearance?
--
NiceAsShit: Both.

debraypiper: To me a waxed canvas outer can be better. If the roll is ever exposed to the elements say a rainy say waxed canvas can bead off water better without fear of damage or conditioning.

DOMIDANN: The canvas outer seems really durable and I don't have to worry about taking care of it as much, though I do understand where you're coming from.  [Walt actually made a custom roll a month or so back with a beautiful leather outer!](http://i.imgur.com/nmaGlGQ.png)  Not sure if he plans on making any more.  If you're interested in something similar, may be worth an email to him!
