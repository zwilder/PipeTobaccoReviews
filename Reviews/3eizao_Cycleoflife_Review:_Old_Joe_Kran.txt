Review: Old Joe Krantz
By: Cycleoflife
---
Thanks to a trade with /u/dope-as-heck, I acquired a couple ounces of OJK. I've been wanting to try this blend ever since /u/hedonaut praised it so profusely in his recent Burley is God post. My only other exposure to a Burley blend has been H&H Classic Burley Kake and I was not taken with it. I wanted to know, is Burley really not for me? 

**Old Joe Krantz**

**Tin note**: Dirty sock, mushroom, pumpernickel, touch of honey 

**Moisture**: Dry as a popcorn fart 

**Smoke**: Thick, voluminous clouds of rich blue smoke. Cool burning, easy to manage. Needed 2 relights, but that was from me backing off the vitamin N. 

**Flavor**: on char light, cigar leaf and that's it. Reminded me of smoking bidi's in high school and choking hard. Ephemeral hints of rabbit cage and lavender soap punctuate a background of ashtray and brimstone. It literally feels like I put multiple cigarettes out in the back of my throat at a whiskey bar just to prove that I could... but I've never done that...ahem. 

**Nicotine**: Monstrous. Praise the maker, but is Burley mouth the price I have to pay for a solid N hit? In any case, I'm glad to know where to go when I'm looking for love. 

**Aftertaste**: ashy, but short lived. I'm happy about this. 

**Notes**: I measured, and my testicles now hang 3mm lower. My man boobs haven't shrunk, but they've sprouted a promising mane ala Tom Jones. I've sealed the beast, for now. Hopefully it will develop some manners in a year or so, or I will become the man it deserves. Either way, I have confirmed my ambivalence for Burley. Perhaps 3 Friars will be my next foray, but I'm in no hurry.

**Edit**: grammar
====================================
Chuzordie: Good review, nice use of imaginative wording.   Nearly spewed my coffee at popcorn fart.

====================================
chewsyourownadv: OJK is a pretty heavy burley. I enjoy it on occasion, but can't smoke it regularly.

Hit that 3 Friars soon. It's **much** more tame than OJK. It's a bit heavier on Perique, and a lot lighter on the burley.

====================================
hedonaut: This smoke is a difficult one. I wonder if my open love of it has neglected that part. Jar it, let it rest for a few months, and come back to it. OJK needs to be smoked extremely slowly to get more out if it. It's a hard smoke to handle, but the rewards are great. In any case, great review. 
--
Cycleoflife: I tend to smoke on the fast side, so that may be part of the issue. I'll keep that in mind when I unseal the beast. Thanks! 
--
hedonaut: That would do it. It doesn't help that it's a full 25% perique. Have you noticed a theme with C&D yet? Anywho, when burley ferments, there's a lot of ammonia going on. If you've ever gotten a harsh sting from a cigar, it's the same phenomenon. Some folks are more sensitive to it than others. Let it age a little, and take it as slow as can be. I recently opened a tin of OJK that had five and a half years on it. It was sweet and mellow while still being powerful. 
--
Cycleoflife: You know, I never met a cigar I liked particularly, and burley blends strike me in the same way. Harsh, ashy, and cigar-y. The ammonia explains the rabbit cage flavors I was getting, and the red Virginia explains the brimstone, something I particularly enjoy from red Virginia. I'm surprised that the perique went pretty much over my head, but I'm still new to the perique world, too. 

I will come back to this blend again, for sure, after a little age.

====================================
tennesseean_87: I felt like the Perique was pretty prominent here, with a fair amount of VA sweetness for a Burley blend. If you thought this was tough, don't try haunted bookshop. It's a bit harsher to my palate. 
--
Cycleoflife: Thanks for the tip
--
hedonaut: I absolutely agree with /u/tennesseean_87. OJK was a god slug of Red VA to sweeten it up. Haunted is even more burley forward, but, oddly enough, less full bodied on account of the particular burley blend. OJK had a good dose of dark burley, which is what lends it those cigar notes you tasted. Haunted Bookshop, on the other hand, has more white burley, which is not as thick as dark, but higher in nicotine and more acerbic. 
--
Cycleoflife: I will probably have to try haunted bookshop, too, just cause I'll never back down from a fight and I have to try everything at least once. I won't go buying 2oz, though!

====================================
Titanio_Blanco: Nice review, I bought a few oz of OJK several weeks ago and have been smoking it every day since. Really hits the spot since I typically only have one pipe at the end of the day. It's a strong one, but I tend to smoke it slow and am not prone to any issues like Burley mouth or getting bit. Saludos
--
Cycleoflife: I have to say, it was a very satisfying bowl, it just lacked the smoking pleasure I've become accustomed to with other blends. I will let it age a bit, and then try again with a slower cadence. I could see it becoming a regular in my rotation someday if I can figure it out. Cheers!
