Uncynical Review of Captain Black Grape and PJ Cobb

Someone asked me to review Captain Black Grape after I posted my mail call for this week:  
[mail call](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/5t45lx/mail_call_or_how_1_dollar_at_pc_turned_into/)  
  
First, let us set a frame of reference. My usual smokes: Froggy Style Morton, Cult Conspiracy, Cult Blood Red Moon.   
    
The tool:  
[The PJ Cob UNMASKED](http://i.imgur.com/DPhJXY2.jpg)  
  
This Panama Jack pipe came as part of a promo. It seems to be a [Marcus](http://corncobpipe.com/marcus.html). The promo price is 1.49 lower than the list price. It draws well and is featherlight as you would expect from an MM.  
  
Captain Black Grape's odor was detectable as soon as I opened my package from P&C. The pouch itself was sealed inside a transparent wrapper. When I opened that wrapper to get the pouch out I was taken back to being 8 years old and opening a pouch of [Big League Chew](http://media2.hickorees.com/image/BigLeagueChewGrape_L4.jpg). There was a super heavy artificial grape flavor that practically assaulted me. Mind you, I like grape soda and artificial grape smell. This was pronounced. "Hey, I'm Grape. Deal with it."  
  
So I packed a bowl in the fresh cob. During the char light, I accidentally inhaled a bit. It was tolerable. From that accident, I discerned that this might actually be rolled and smoked in the urban market perhaps?   
  
It smoked on the warm side but wasn't hot. I didn't have aromatic gurgle. It was dry enough from the pouch that it didn't need to decant. It was mild on flavor, smell was okay as it smoked. It wasn't a bad smoke at all for something that is obviously a gimmick tobacco.  
  
Who is this for? I wonder. If you've had Shisha from a Hookah and want that type of flavor at home without preparing a Hookah, maybe this is for you? I certainly wouldn't smoke this every day but I could see smoking it when you feel like Shisha. Or for sharing with friends on a lark. I could smell a hint of artificial grape in my mustache through the night. I liked that reminder since I like getting Fanta Zero Grape from Coke Freestyle machines.   
  
This is definitely not tobacco for a snob or for someone who smokes for their own pretentious self-image. This is a smoke for someone looking for something fun and different. This isn't five star tobacco by any means, but it isn't trying to be.  
  
Here is my ad suggestion for Lane Limited for their Captain Black product line for this particular blend, [the Grapist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh1RkRxnAOs).

givemeyours0ul: I'M GOING TO TIE YOU TO A RADIATOR AND GRAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH!  
That's a favorite.

Fuzzy_Totemz: That should be the marketing for this. Captain Black will Grape you in the mouth.

====================================
Fuzzy_Totemz: Bonus: The 15 dollar random filter briar side by side with a Grabow Grand Duke.  The rando briar draws better, is much lighter, and has a larger bowl than the Grand Duke.

Pipezilla: I can't find it anywhere by me... If you want to swap a couple of bowls I got lots of tobacco I'm willing to part with.  HMU.

====================================
coldsolderjoint: as a pipe n00b, i kind of liked the Captain Black Cherry in terms of smell and flavor. Going to give it another couple tries on the wetness and smokability front. 

But.. I can definitely understand the difference between something like CB Cherry and 965.

====================================
PhysicsNovice: So is tobacco snob what we're calling people who can sense flavor?
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Snob isn't a derogatory term in this sense.  
  
I may know how to enjoy a good cigar but when when it comes to cigars I am a snob. No Swishers, Phillies, White Owls, etc. Heck, there's a list of premiums on I could rattle on as well.  
  
When it comes to pipe tobacco I am less disinclined to be a snob. Probably because the honest truth is that a pack of Captain Black White after 8 years of not smoking was like manna from Heaven (about a year ago when I picked the pipe back up).
  
The difference between drug store cigars and drug store pipe tobacco is the difference between eating someone else's sweaty socks and drinking a McDonald's coffee.  
  
I understand why a pipe snob would never even try this blend, and that's fine with me too.
