[Review] Spaniola's Pipe and Tobacco Co. - Arrowhead
By: HavelDad

Our first Tobacco is a wonderful thing isn't it? No matter if you enjoyed it or not it's something you'll always remember it in one way or another. For me my introduction to piping was at Paul's Pipe shop in Flint MI, the same area this blend is made and sold. This also happens to be the place I got my first pipe, so I'll try to keep the rose tinted glasses off while I give you my first amateur review of this blend. 

**The Blender:** Originally created by Paul Spaniola on accident according to his son, this store has been in business for close to 100 years; first popping up in 1928.


**The Blend:** Arrowhead - Pipe club mixture


**Packaging:** A bag sized at 1.5oz, 4oz, 8oz, or 16oz


**The Tobacco:** A Virginia base, mixed with a mild burly, some unnamed flake, and a touch of Perique. It's a somewhat moist mix, but smokes well without much drying.


**Opening:** The first smell you'll get is a very light vanilla bean scent, and no not that artificial vanilla, something real and pleasant but not too strong as to be off putting. 

**The smoke:** Oh boy if the scent of the bag doesn't get me excited the smell of the tobacco burning and the taste gets my heart racing. The smell of the bag translates to the smoke so well, its a light and beautiful smelling vanilla with an almost light spice (Possibly the Perique?) but also lets your nose pick up the fresh tobacco while you taste it. I'd say this is somewhere between an Aromatic and an English blend, it isn't overtly one flavor or noticeably flavored like the Connoisseur's Choice and H&H Berry Nice I have. The tobacco is tasteful and noticeably there, it's mild and the burly/Virginia's shine through wonderfully. 


**Conclusion/My thought's:** This is my every day blend and my all time favorite. There's some intricacies here I may not quite be able to taste as my pallet isn't entirely developed yet. (The Perique and flake that Paul's son said were in there are lost on me as I'm a novice) But the combination of this strange middle ground between aromatic and English is in my opinion very desirable. You won't have to worry about lacking flavor with this blend like some aromatics, it's profile is there and those around you will likely enjoy the smell as much as you enjoy the taste. 

**Strength:** 2/4 Medium **Room:** 2/4 also Medium **Taste:** 2/4 Medium again **Overall:** 4/4

**Would I recommend this blend?:** Yes especially as an edition to your every day smokes. Even more so for new smokers, its a lovely smelling and tasting blend that doesn't bite and burns evenly, so it's easy to get in to. There isn't too much Nicotine, not an overbearing sweet or English smell, its a nice easygoing middle-ground. However it offers an experience that is unique and may help a new smoker decide what tastes and smells they really want from their tobaccos.

Thanks for reading, hopefully it wasn't awful! 
If anyone has any questions feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer. 

====================================
FL1NTST0N3: Nice review and well put! I just love how the blend has a long history behind it and is their absolute best seller. I'm not a big fan of aromatics but this one is so lightly topped and doesn't offend or require an hour of drying like many do. The way it evolves as you go down the bowl is wonderful. First greeting you with a warm and sweet top note then for me about a third of the way in catches you with the virginias and the perique rounds it off with that ever so slight punch for a great mouthfeel. I'm almost always able to take it all the way to the bottom no problem. One of the few blends I've easily been able to do that with. :D Will always spell home for me.

cmdr_andrew_dermott: Have you tried any actual English, yet? Arrowhead is soundly aromatic. Not that that's a dis; it's decent. I can even tolerate the low dose of Perique. 

I should revisit my jar. I remembered it burning surprisingly well, for as most as it felt.

HavelDad: Yes I have a tin of Nightcap and smoked some Dunhill Early morning pipe.

I might just be an idiot but it doesn't seem to me a full on aro as compared to others I've smoked.

cmdr_andrew_dermott: Could be I'm more overdue to revisit this than I thought I was... It was freaking cold when I got it, so I was probably rushing through bowls. 
--
HavelDad: Its totally worth visiting again either way, I love the stuff, flavor profile is very very nice.

coldsolderjoint: Well that sounds tasty!

professor_throway: Nice review!  

I have a soft spot for these classic burley Va all day blends. I will have to give this one a try.
