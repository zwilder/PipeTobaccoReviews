Tobacco Review: Esoterica Stonehaven
By: antiwittgenstein
---
Review # 94

**Blend Name:** Esoterica Stonehaven
 
**Description on Tin:** A marriage of air-cured leaf and Burley with selected dark Virginia. Hard pressed and aged to produce brown flakes with rich, dark undertones. A traditional flake favored by experienced pipe smokers.

**Leaf:** From the bag, extremely long, say 6-7” flakes, very thin, very dark. They are fairly neat in the packaging but turn to black confetti with just a little touch.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Vinegar, musty, earth, very faint rum raisin, woodsy

**Age when smoked:** Factory fresh

**Taste:** Light. Or non-existent to start. Takes a bit before it really takes the flame. Dark virginia flavors here, plummy and interesting, a bit of salt. There is a burley earthiness and richness too, sort of in the aged burley line. Gives it a cigar like quality from time to time. The VA adds a very slight tang, nothing ostentatious. Earthy and plums. That is the mainstay here. When it really gets going, particularly when you retrohale, it has a touch of Lakeland, not like that soapy nonsense, but like the one Lakeland that didn’t make me gag, Grousemoor. It is very light, but has that weird savoury-salty-perfumey tang. So faint it is more like the blenders were smoking Grousemoor when they were prepping this stuff. Cigarettes. There is something about this blend that reminds me of stolen drags of cigarettes in my dissipated youth, Camels to be exact. One of the remarkable qualities of this smoke is the softness of it, as if every sharp thing about it had been carefully filed away and sanded down. I noticed this same thing in my last review, of the Medium Flake. Maybe it is the leaf sourced or it could be a processing secret. 

**Nicotine:**4-5. Really heavy for a VA, a bit light for a burley forward blend.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** It is wet but not McClelland or Samuel Gawith impossible. Takes awhile to dry but can be smoked even a bit moist to the touch. The thinness of the flakes makes it easy to rub out or fold’n’stuff as you like. I like to roughly rub it out then recombine it into a bullet or cannonball. Takes awhile to really cherry but hangs tough once it does.
 
**Side Stream:** Earthy, a bit cigarettes

**Thoughts:** Not quite the Johnny Walker Blue of tobaccos, but it is hard not to make the comparison. JWBL is a legendary scotch which everyone slightly interested in Whisky has heard of. But those that build up to it after digging through Single Malts for awhile invariably find it disappointing. It isn’t that it is bad. It is just that the blend has such a pedigree, such presentation, such a reputation of exclusivity, that the tasty but not overly complex experience falls short of much more pedestrian offerings. 

Unlike JWBL Stonehaven can and should improve with age. Even after the sampling and the giveaway I have ounces of this stuff left. I will check back in from time to time to see what happens to it. And if I can wreck the sub with unaged Stonehaven, I can positively destroy it with some aged flake I think.
 
**What you should smoke instead:** This is really the only point of reading this review. Either you have some of this lying around, know a generous hoarder, or more likely, won’t have much opportunity to smoke this. So why read this review? So I can tell you what other blends can most closely approximate the experience.

* Solani Aged Burley Flake – While being purely burley, the SABF in my opinion has a very Virginia like taste as well, giving a really, really close flavor profile to Stonehaven.
* Full Virginia Flake – While missing some of the deep earthy notes, FVF has the same or probably better plummy flavors.
* Erinmmore – hear me out on this one. Not Erinmore directly from the tin. Take it out, rub it out, let it dry out for a few days so that the apricot topping evaporates. While it doesn’t totally lose the apricot flavors, the remaining smoke is incredibly Stonhaven-esque, with deep VA and earthy burley tastes.
* Carter Hall – Now snobs really won’t like this one, but they are incredibly similar. Carter Hall’s VA is brighter, less plummy, the burley’s less rich, but to the less nuanced palate they would be fairly indistinguishable from one another.

What if you want something in the same vein but objectively superior?

* C&D Haunted Bookshop – my favorite burley. Deep, rich burley flavors more distinct and satisfying than the ‘haven can deliver.
* C&D Burley Flake # 1 – Similar to Haunted Bookshop but more stripped down and perfect for that smoker who is weaning themselves off of horse tranquilizers.
* McClelland Blackwoods – Possibly my all time favorite smoke. Deeper, plumier flavors. Bright citrus-vinegar tang. Meaty, salty, and savoury. You can taste the McClelland Worcestershire Sauce tin note distinctly.
* Black Irish X – Texas style BBQ brisket for your pipe. This stuff will make you hallucinate if you don’t build up to it first.

**Summary:** Stonehaven, Carter Hall for the Polo set

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

I've tended to think the same when folks go raiding and pillaging the stores for Stonehaven. They're not the same, sure, but if you like Stonehaven, you'll probably like these two just as much.

> Erinmmore 

... did not see that coming.

Your comments in general make for a pretty fair evaluation of all Esoterica blends I've tried. They're **good**, but I consistently find blends that I like more.

chewsyourownadv: > Black Irish X – Texas style BBQ brisket for your pipe. This stuff will make you hallucinate if you don’t build up to it first.

I do have to say, though, this one seems out of place. The dark fired bits make it a pretty different experience.
--
antiwittgenstein: Those recommendations at the end are not meant to be replacements, but something around the same box that I think are fantastic and much more worthy of superlative and hoarding behavior.
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: What is your rating!?!? 
--
antiwittgenstein: Pending consistent availability - mythical beasts don't get ratings from me.
--
givemeyours0ul: Ah! Fair, I guess. Could you put that under Rating:? 
--
====================================
mgvsquared: Ugh, now I want to crack open my tin on Blackwoods. I bought a tin on a whim and its still sitting in my "to be smoked soon, not aged" cellar.

Fun fact about Stonehaven, at least from what I hear, the only topping is molasses.

Anyway, great review and matches my experience with it pretty to the point, though, I feel it can be pretty wet or syrupy because of the topping. I've consistently had to leave it out for an hour or two or else it is bitey to me. But I chug pretty hard sometimes, so that's probably just my inability to "sip" the baccy.
--
antiwittgenstein: I would suggest you open the Blackwoods now and let it sit for a month before smoking. Maybe it will be ready by New Years if you are in a dry climate. I am not joking either. I did this with both Blackwoods and Dark Star and it was the only thing that made them combustible. 

I never heard the 'haven was topped, but a light treacle makes sense. Of course I try to keep myself fairly ignorant of what I smoke beforehand, so that I don't go looking for tastes.
--
AuRelativity: Blackwoods vs Dark Star?
--
antiwittgenstein: I really prefer Blackwoods but this just a preferred flavor profile, not that one is clearly superior to the other. Blackwoods is big citrusy and juicy and sweet, Darkstar more plummy-vinegar and more dry. If you are a big FVF fan, Darkstar is going to be your tin, if you prefer OGS, then shoot for Blackwoods.
--
AuRelativity: Thanks a lot!
I really like the sweet, juice, plum ... less-so the vinegar, dry...
I've got some Larsen Signature which has a super citrus note.

What I'll do tonight, is smoke some Orlik Golden Slices and see what I think about it....

If I can find some FVF, I definitely want to try it.

Thanks again!

====================================
Nicepuro: Excellent review, thank you. This is going on the saved folder. 
--
====================================
VilaFrancaWeimar: Great review, but I still don't have the courage to try Erinmore. Really useful list of close and better tobacco to choose from. The christmas wishlist is growing by the minute!
--
givemeyours0ul: Do you find toppings to be very strong? Have you tried Firedance Flake? Some find it to have an "overpowering" berry flavor. I can barely taste the berry. The same is true for Erinmore Flake (not to be confused with Erinmore *mixture*, which is apparently a full goop aromatic).
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Generally yes, I am a really sensitive guy, thanks for the tip. I haven't tried any of them, it is just that I smoked so many cheesy aros that I just don't have the patience for them anymore. They are both probably pretty good tobaccos but I just can't do it right now. Maybe my tastes will develop in the future.
--
givemeyours0ul: To be clear, unlike to goop soaked black Cavendish of most aros, both Firedance and Erinmore are solid flake tobaccos, with good tobacco flavor. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Yes, I understood. I know that not all topings or aromatics are alike or are made for the same experiences. Right now I have some royal yacht in my rotation that I am enjoying a lot even though it has a clear fruity feel to it. In the future I will probably try them, but there are so much more I want to try before, so I will save them for another time 😉. 
--
AuRelativity: A really late reply, but thank you for suddenly making me very excited to try Firedance Flake!
--
====================================
zero-hunter: Aged Stonehaven is pretty outstanding. It gives off more cocoa on the nose and a floral hint in the taste. 
--
eldritchpipes: Yep. Fresh Stonehaven is ok.
Aged Stonehaven is awesome.
--
====================================
eldritchpipes: Great review!
Stonehaven benefits substantially from having a year in a jar though.

What to smoke instead if you're in Europe?: Germain's Rich Dark Flake. Made by the same company and superior to fresh Stonehaven.
--
====================================
professor_throway: Great review. I really love the JWB comparison. To me Stonehaven would be a regular in my pipe if it were available, but I am not going to go chasing it down or pay over-retail pricing for it. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks mate. It is really hard for me to give things like this a fair shot, another reason why I didn't give it a rating. It would be fun to do a blind comparison to see what I think of it sans expectation. I will see if the future-wife is game setting me up for a go.
--
====================================
brainskan13: I finally got a hold of about 1.5 ounces of Stonehaven a couple of months ago in a trade. I smoked 3 bowls of it and am saving the rest.

The first comparison that instantly came to my mind was Esoterica's Tilbury. I smoked a whole tin of that this past year, and I immediately wanted to say that Tilbury is like Stonehaven-lite-ready-rubbed. And Tilbury is much easier to acquire. I don't know about online, but a couple of local tobacconists in my area seem to regularly get it in stock. Am I crazy? Does anyone else who has tried both Tilbury and Stonehaven see the similarity?

I think your comparison with Erinmore Flake is interesting. Erinmore has a similar type of citrus fruit/sour hint that does connect with Stonehaven's deep plum flavor in my brain too. I can really see that.

Stonehaven: I am glad I finally got to try some, for the palate reference. It's a top notch pipe tobacco, an excellent smoke. It's worth trying, but there are many many tobaccos that are easy to get and just as good. FVF and McClelland Blackwoods are good examples.
--
AuRelativity: Thanks for the suggestion! I will try Tilbury now!
