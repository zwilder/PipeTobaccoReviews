Review Contest Results

Fellow pipe smokers, time to crawl back out of your hiding places, it is December 1st and my reign of terror upon the sub has ended. I had hoped for some measure of response to the review contest but I was quite impressed with how much y'all dove into this. There were over 40 reviews submitted to /r/pipetobacco by 17 different memembers. 40. I don't think we normally get 40 reviews in the sub in the average year. Three of you submitted 5 reviews a piece this month. That is commitment or that is greed. Either way I feel like my little Lex Luthor moment has been a dazzling success.

Now for the part you scrolled down immediately to see, I present **The Winners:**

Our high score winners:

* /u/AdamantFinn with 5 reviews
* /u/aelmer2821 with 5 reviews
* /u/professor_throway with 5 reviews
* /u/crimblade with 4 reviews
* /u/Old_Deadhead with 3 reviews

And for the most entertaining reviews, our winners:

* /u/VilaFrancaWeimar who also had 3 reviews and this fantastic review of [Capstan Blue](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7ddy2t/capstan_original_navy_cut_a_review/)
* /u/chewsyourownadv gets to name his own winner from his sub contest in his review of [C&D Awakened Elder](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7cgxpr/cd_awakened_elder_a_review/)
* /u/misterzipp0 for an in depth review of [C&D Speakeasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7bb5y7/review_cd_speakeasy_long/)
* /u/Bragisson for a stout review of [Black Irish X](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7awegy/black_irish_x_review/)
* /u/im_a_lurker_too ruining their user name with a stand out 1st review of [PS English Luxury](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7frwxo/newbies_first_review_peter_stokkebye_english/)

Thank you all and congratulations. Make sure to PM me you mailing addresses so you can claim your prize. 

However to show I am a better villain than most I will still be sending samples to the other six contest entrants (/u/levins0 recused himself). So I also need addresses from /u/TheGooseman_ /u/Super_Maxco /u/petrus_and_coke
/u/JetLife794 /u/IndyPiper and /u/HandsomeRalphy .
If you send along your pipe tobacco preferences I can try to find something interesting to send your way.

Again, thanks to everyone for flooding the sub with high quality reviews all month long. Please keep it up even now when you aren't being cajoled.

====================================
SupraMario: Awesome contest /u/antiwittgenstein! 

And great job everyone on participating in it.

chewsyourownadv: This was pretty neat. It's the kind of thing that helps make this sub a good place. Think we could sticky this post for a few days?
--
SupraMario: Sure why not it's good for the sub for people to see this type of participation and members doing contests

====================================
chewsyourownadv: Ia, /u/antiwittgenstein! 

/u/smokeonthewater17 's [butchering](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7cgxpr/cd_awakened_elder_a_review/dppt5xj/) of Lovecraft's [Cats and Dogs](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/cd.aspx) had me cracking up for a while, and easily wins all of my internets.

====================================
aelmer2821: Thanks /u/antiwittgenstein! It was a fun contest. PM inbound!
--
====================================
VilaFrancaWeimar: Man, I never won anything in my life! Thank you very much for doing this, you really did put some new blood in the veins of this great sub. Congrats to all the reviewers.
--
====================================
AdamantFinn: Thank you /u/antiwittgenstein! This has been a lot of fun to be a part of and there have been so many great reviews!

So good to know about even more tobaccos I now need to buy and try.... 
--
====================================
Bragisson: Haay I won a thing! Thank you for holding the contest!
--
====================================
professor_throway: Thanks for organizing. I promise to get the the other reviews in the "simple strong an shaggy" series as soon as possible.

I also recused myself as I have tried stonehaven in the past. Since /u/antiwittgenstein gave me permission to play as champion for someone else I would like to award my prize to /u/JetLife794 for his great review of Glengarry Flake (provided it is approved by our contest evil overlord).

From the review in question:
>  Typical Lakeland essence at first which waned quickly into soft, warm honey notes and subtle sweetness that is quite pleasant and in no way cloying. More like an immediately post-menopausal woman who hasnt fully taken on the granny scent. Dont get me wrong, she's pinching children's cheeks and sometimes wears a house dress, but she hasn't yet begun keeping Werther's Originals around the house or getting the walking farts at the grocery.

--
antiwittgenstein: Yes of course I will allow it. That was indeed a *memorable* review.
--
JetLife794: Thanks so much man! As someone who's never tried the infamous Stonehaven it means a lot. 
--
professor_throway: Cheers. Hope you like it! Try to enjoy it for what it is, a pretty good burley/VA flake. If you let it adopt a mythical personal you will be let down when you taste it.
--
====================================
crimblade: Thanks for the great manipulation I've been blessed to be a part of!

Thankfully it didn't completely tap me out of my in progress reviews, I just ran out of time with the holidays. 
--
====================================
misterzipp0: Thanks again for putting this on!  I miss doing my "first impression" reviews, here's to hoping that I can start finding the time in 2018!
--
====================================
Old_Deadhead: Hey, just noticed this! Thanks to /u/antiwittgenstein for putting this together! I have discovered I enjoy writing these reviews, so I will definitely keep it going, even without the reward system!


--
====================================
Bragisson: Hey /u/antiwittgenstein I sent you a PM. Looking for an update
--
====================================
im_a_lurker_too: Thank you /u/antiwittgenstein for setting this up (and making sure I found out I was a winner)!

I thoroughly enjoyed writing my first review and look forward to contributing at least a couple more over the holidays!
