Tobacco Review: H&H Cerberus

Review # 73

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home Cerberus
 
**Description on Tin:** Created for International Pipe Smoking Day in 2012, Cerberus is the most Latakia-forward of all the Hearth & Home Marquee Series blends.
Named for the three-headed hound that keeps the denizens of Hades from returning to the world, Cerberus' name refers to the fact that this robust, yet cool-smoking blend contains the three main condimental tobaccos - Latakia, Perique and dark-fired Kentucky. In addition, there's some excellent matured Virginias, and enough exotic Orientals to brighten the flavor, while making Cerberus' aroma even more intriguing.
The Latakia is a finer cut to deliver as much smoky goodness as possible, and it's best to pack this with a light hand. You'll be rewarded with lush, creamy smoke that will remind you of the outdoors. But don't take our word for it.

**Leaf:** Brown and beige hodgepodge.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Smoky soap, earthy, dirt in the rain, 

**Taste:** Smoky bright and rich. Very tangy, more lemony than anything else, either from the Virginia or Oriental. Or should I say Oriental or Turkish, as this blend is confusingly said to contain both (which is like saying this parenthetical statement is both a simile and a metaphor). There is a noticeable, consistent spice all the way through the smoke, less white or black pepper and more like the unflavored heat of cayenne. The Latakia gives a bit of a soapy-lavender edge but not in a way that offends me. Of course that floral element could be exuded by the Perique too, but it is so well married pulling out the contributions of each component is fairly impossible. As it moves towards the middle it becomes very creamy, like a thick spicy-smoky cream soup. This creaminess comes with a push of a the latent woody tastes forward, which with the smoke, reminds me a bit of a well charred bourbon or a bit of smoked brisket. There is just a faint hint of beef about the whole ordeal as well. This is a poor choice for an early July smoke, as it belongs more to Winter, with cold held at bay more by will than by clothing, with a thick tome of something brooding and Russian to read when you are done. Oh well, this is the sample I have now and I am bound to review it, damn the thermometer and calendar. After the midway point it pulls itself together in a lemon, spice, cream, wood, smoke. This rolls back and forth, favoring one taste given any single puff, but that is larger picture. Oh and it is vaguely sweet, not so that you would necessarily call it sweet, but enough to hold it all together and make each flavor pop.

**Nicotine:** Extremely mild considering it has Latakia, Dark Fired, and Perique. About a 3-4.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Easy-peasy.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but I am gonna guess smoky?

**Thoughts:** I was prepared to be underwhelmed by this blend, as the last Russ product I had, RO Firestorm, seemed a bit overdone. I looked at the laundry list of ingredients and thought it was gonna be another one of those modern kitchen sink blends that try to throw too many tastes at you at once without working to make sure all the components work together (Yes I am talking about Mississippi River). But all the tastes balanced and complemented each other: the sour played off the sweet, the smoke with the cream, the wood with the spice and every other permutation of tastes. So Russ, let me tender my apologies, this is a work of art.

As for how Cerberus compares with more standard fare, well it is sort of a cross ways between the ‘Vanilla’ English of Squadron Leader and the more smoky-spicy Nightcap. It has the balance of Squadron Leader, but has say, about half the heat of Nightcap, with maybe, carry the one… 32% more smoky goodness, much of that I believe coming from the combination of Latakia and Dark Fired.

And in reference to the unfortunate cloud under which all pipedom waits in fearful anticipation, in the middle of me reviewing this blend I found out it is going to be withdrawn from production. I hope, I truly hope this is just a marketing ploy, but just in case it is going the way of Revelation I plan to grab a tin if it is still around the next time I order. Just so I can enjoy this stuff in the proper weather and maybe save my grandson a pinch for his 21st birthday.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Squadron Leader, Nightcap
 
**Summary:** A well balanced, well married hodge podge English with a sour-woody-creamy-smoky-spice that might haunt you for decades.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
ax_and_smash: Great review!

This wasn't even on my radar but, since you compared it to squadron leader and nightcap, I'm going to have to buy a tin or two.
