**Name:** L.J. Peretti D-7485

**Type:** English (American English)

**Leaf:** Burley, Virginia, Oriental/Turkish, Latakia

**Blender’s Description:** A masterpiece of the blender's art. A rich, spicy blend that lends itself to gracious living. A luxury tobacco which is cool and mild. Made originally for the late Hon. Ramsay MacDonald. A blend that lends itself to gracious living. D-7485 blends a number of tobaccos to provide a cool, mild smoke. It is considered by many to be a perfect "all day" smoke.

**Old Deadhead’s Opinion:** This is the second tobacco I am reviewing from the [L.J. Peretti “Hybrid Sampler”](http://www.ljperetti.com/specials/hybrid-sampler.html) of “American” English blends, another of their offerings with a rather generic nomenclature. I’ve smoked this out of several pipes but, for the purposes of this review, I enjoyed a bowl from a Savinelli Unfinished bent billiard. 

The cut is a bit irregular, which seems to be the norm for Peretti, [a mix a tans and browns, some dark bits of Latikia, and a bit of loose leaf](https://imgur.com/eUn0il1). Smells somewhat sweet, a bit tangy, and packs fairly easily, just don’t tamp too hard, the chunks like to breathe. 

The charring light is unmistakably burley; smooth, nutty, and just a bit sweet, possibly from a hint of the Virginias. Upon getting the bowl lit, the orientals take center stage, spicy on the tongue, but tempered by the burley. The Latakia and Virginas are supporting roles until about halfway through the bowl. Even at a moderate pace, there’s no bite, although the spice is a nice treat. It might take an occasional relight, but smokes fairly consistently. By the time we get to the second half of the bowl, the Virginias really take over, and their sweetness becomes very noticeable, the burley still present, but the oriental spice diminishing. A little moisture in the bottom of the bowl, but that may be remedied with a little more drying time. 

**Summary:** This seems like a very similar blend to [D-9575](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/7asrkr/review_l_j_peretti_d9575/), with the addition of the Turkish/orientals. A thoroughly enjoyable blend, and a likely candidate for an all-day smoke for any Burley lover looking for English blends. I will likely purchase more at some point in the future, but there’s nothing so unique about it that it will be on my Christmas wish list, at least not this year. 

**3.5/5**

Scale:

5/5: This is Heaven, man!!

4/5: This deserves to be in my regular rotation

3/5: I'd probably revisit this at some point

2/5: Well, that was...interesting

1/5: WTF did I just smoke?

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Another nice review. Care to compare it to any more blends?

Old_Deadhead: Good call! I would say Ashton's Consummate Gentleman is probably the closest I can recall. Neither is overpowering in the Latakia department, both are a "sweeter" English but still have a nice spice from the orientals, and both have some burley in the mix. The difference is the amount and flavor of the burley, which is much more noticeable in the Peretti blend.

Either is a good choice for a lighter English, but I would say 7485 would be the preference for a burley lover.
