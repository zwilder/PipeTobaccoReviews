Tobacco Review: C&D Three Friars
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #46

**Blend Name:** Cornell & Diehl Three Friars

**Description on Tin:** Three Friars is intended to be similar to the original Three Nuns, but in composition, it’s somewhere between the original and the newer version, due to the addition of dark Burley. As a quality Va/Bur/Per, it can stand on its own without the comparisons.
 
**Leaf:** Short standard ribbon in a light chestnut color.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Very bready-nutty with a hint of sweetness. Honey wheat bread really.
 
**Taste:** Bready and surprisingly sweet. It has that same combination of bready-raisin sweetness found in Carter Hall, where the Burley and Virginia are proportioned so that neither taste is subsumed by the other. Floral and peppery Perique. It is, very surprisingly knowing the MO of the C&D people, delightfully light, so that at points the spice nearly disappears, leaving just the blush of carnations smudged across your perceptions. It grows richer in time, butter, cream, with a touch of salt. It is a warming creamy soup with a couple twists of pepper. The bready-nutty flavors are gone about the halfway point, so the experience changes to this sweet, buttery combination, with just those snatches of spice. It never grows ashy so you are taken aback when suddenly your bowl is nothing but chalk and dottle.

**Nicotine:** Whoah buddy. This will satisfy, pacify, and liquefy the imbiber.

**Smokability:** Dry in that charming C&D way, but you should still let it rest out for a few minutes, if only not to tempt the gods to punish your hubris. This one really expands when she takes light, so be prepared for several light-tamp cycles to get started. Once or twice each bowl I will get good old burley mouth from this – if you are unfamiliar with the sensation it not tongue bite, it is not mouth bite, it is more akin to a momentary spasm of laryngitis.  
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside, but I smell like the Greyhound station.

**Thoughts:** Another swank burley blend from C&D. Unlike Old Joe Krantz though, its close stablemate, it is not as overwhelming, but is a creature of finesse and delicacy. Sure, she is gonna crush your bones with her Nicotine, but the balance of the components are such that it is a pleasant dreamy descent into your pipe induced stupor. A recommend stop on your Burley Pilgrimage

**Similar Tobaccos:** Carter Hall, Old Joe Krantz, Country Gentleman.

**Summary:** A perfectly balanced blend of Burley, Virginia, and Perique.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** ++++

Rating system (interpreted through the world of chain Coffee):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Intelligenstia)

(++++) Great (Starbucks Dark Roasts)

(+++) Very good (Dunkin Donuts)

(++) Good (Ihop)

(+) I think like it (Burger King)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (McDonalds)

(-) I think I dislike this (Any chain, non breakfast, sit down resturant)

(--)This is not for me (Starbucks Pike Peak)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Sheetz – or whatever gas station you choose)

(----)This is suffering (Airplane Coffee)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Cracker Barrel)

Again special thanks to /u/hedonaut for the sample!

antiwittgenstein: Thanks pipemate! I have been smoking on this for awhile, I've tried to review it before but it was never quite clear, either pipe problem, loading problems, age, my palatte. When I smoked it tonight, I was astounded by what I was smoking and new that I had gotten it. 

It is like the first time I heard Built to Spill. It was just noise to me, but after listening to the album a couple of times, it suddenly hit me that those guys are amazing. Man, I should have written this in the review, but was feeling uncharacteristically terse tonight. Welp, it is here in the comment section now.

BWeice: Set in stone... or at least a data bank.. Close enough, I want to get a couple tins and see what a few years can do for this.

====================================
chewsyourownadv: Nice review! /u/hedonaut slapped me with a bunch of C&D samples a while back, and 3 Friars and Epiphany are competing for my favorite burley-ish blends right now. 3 Friars is the first blend I've ever had that seemed to make breaking in a new pipe something to be enjoyed.

====================================
hedonaut: Most ought to know by now that this is one of my main smokes. I really love this stuff. It gets super creamy with a few years of age on it. It's interesting what flavor notes come out of it. My experiences with this blend are [quite similar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2wzeca/review_cornell_diehl_three_friars/) It's strange because, being able to see the recipe now, it's actually quite light on the burley and a full 25% perique, which is quite heavy. 

In any case, great review as always. I look forward to the next one. 
--
tennesseean_87: so this is roughly half VA, 1/4 perique, and 1/4 burley? I've found it very VA forward, with just enough burley to make things interesting. I think that makes sense from the recipe info you've given, but I would never have guessed that much Per!
--
hedonaut: I would actually think it's a bit less burley than that, but there is enough to taste, obviously. C&D uses great Bright VA. I don't know where it comes from, just that it comes in absolutely unsweetened. It's the base of blends like Three Friars and Bourbon Bleu. I think it's that really good Bright that makes these blends what they are and balances the heavy Perique element so nicely. 
--
tennesseean_87: There's a bit of that in VA Gent, too, isn't there? 
--
hedonaut: Indeed. Though their Red is also good.
