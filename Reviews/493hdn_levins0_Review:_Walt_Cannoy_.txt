Last week, /u/WaltCannoyPipes was nice enough to invite our little community here to get a discount in his web store if we would write an unbiased review.  I've been eyeing his "Perfect Pipe Roll" since he announced it, so I took the opportunity to get the discount and check it out.

For a while, I've been carrying some pipes, tobacco and accessories in a 4 pipe pouch I got from Amazon for around $20.  I keep it in my truck, and it works well for that, but it's not great for portability if I'm walking around.

A couple of months back somebody here posted about a waxed canvas roll available on Huckberry.com from Bradley Mountain, which is a site that uses viral marketing (you invite your friends and you both get a discount).  He invited me, I got a $10 coupon, and got the roll for $28.  I give it a solid A-/4 stars.  It's a bit thick, but I like the size overall.  It's got a short pocket for lighter/tool, and two longer pockets for tobacco, pipe cleaners and the pipe.  It folds at the top, and fits nicely in a jacket pocket.  The only issue I have with it is that the clasp is a pain.  The leather strap is quite thick and stiff, and when it's full, the button wobbles around when you try to push it through the hole in the strap, to the point of annoyance.

So, when Walt offered the discount on the "Perfect Pipe Roll", I had to give it a shot, especially since I love maps.  :)

The Perfect Pipe Roll is very well made.  The stitching is high quality, tight and even, and the ends are all finished.  You tend to find stray thread ends in lower quality products -- there are no stray ends on here.  All of the lines are nice and straight and even.

There is a flap that folds over the two long pockets on the left which protects the pipe from falling out.  On the right there's a tobacco pocket that's lined, so you could put tobacco directly into it.  I never do that, because I change blends a lot, so I always use baggies to hold the tobacco and just put the baggies in the tobacco pouch area.  Since I use baggies, I don't need an actual tobacco pouch.  You'll notice in the first pic from the 4 pipe pouch that the tobacco is in baggies.  The pouch came with a little matching tobacco pouch, but I took it out because I didn't need it and it just added bulk.  My preference here would be for just another simple pocket to put the tobacco in, instead of a lined pouch pocket.  However, I can see why some would prefer the lined pocket.  Perhaps that could be an ordering option in the future?

There is a pocket behind the tobacco pouch area, which I would use for a lighter and tamper.  However, with the tobacco pouch on top of it, that area gets a bit thick, and doesn't really hold the lighter/tamper too securely, because the pocket is the full length of the tobacco pouch.  My preference is for the design on the waxed canvas pouch with a short pocket just big enough for the lighter and tamper/tool.  

I much prefer the closure on the Perfect Pipe Roll.  The two leather shoelaces allow for infinite adjustment, and they're very easy to tie several different ways depending on preference.  It's much easier to close, even just to roll up and roll the laces around twice, than the canvas roll and its difficult button.

Overall, it's very well made, and if the pocket arrangement is what you prefer, then I think it's a great value and a very nice pipe roll.  For me, I think if the tobacco pouch were not there and instead there was just a third vertical pocket, then it could be made similar to the waxed canvas roll with a full fold-down flap, which would make it shorter overall and easier to fit in a pocket.  This is strictly a matter of preference.  I'd say overall it's a B+/3.5 stars for me. 

As a postscript, I'll mention that the Perfect Pipe Roll is shown in the photos with my Cardinal House Munn Billiard http://imgur.com/a/9iZnd .  It's an excellent pipe, especially for under $200.  The rustication is evenly done, but simple and unremarkable.  The stem and button are thin and light, which I like very much, and the stem lines up perfectly with the shank as long as it's oriented correctly.  It's not quite symmetrical, so if you push it in rotated 180 degrees, it doesn't quite line up.  The fit of the tenon is tight.  The airway is smooth, free and open, and I have never gotten a gurgle.  The pipe smokes like a dream.  For me, the engineering of the airway is my primary consideration (does it smoke well), followed closely by the stem and button work.  I'm getting spoiled by artisan pipes.  This pipe definitely gets an A+ / 5 stars from me.

DarumaRed: I agree with that pocket - it's a nice touch and shows a lot of care, but more space seems seems appealing. Gorgeous picks and craftsmanship all around.
