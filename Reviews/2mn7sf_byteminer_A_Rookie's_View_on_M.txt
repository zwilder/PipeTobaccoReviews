A Rookie's View on Mac Baren Old Dark Fired
By: byteminer
---
I tried Mac Baren Old Dark Fired for the first time successfully today.  I'm fairly new to pipes, only having been at it for about six weeks now.  ODF is a hot pressed flake tobacco, and it really resembles tobacco colored chewing gum if you've never seen it.  The flakes are about the size of a Big Red stick.  My first attempts with ODF were rather embarrassing actually, but I'll discuss them any way.  On my first attempt I didn't let the tobacco dry nearly long enough and used far too much.  I took about four flakes and just went about shredding the shit out of them, charging ahead with ignorance and enthusiasm.  I then proceeded to pack that into my pipe, using the air pocket method and really cramming that bowl shaped plug in there.  I tested the draw and it was a little thicker than normal, but not bad really.  So then I tried to light it.

And tried...

And tried...

And finially it catches.  Remember earlier when I said I hadn't let it dry enough? This was like trying to start a campfire in the rain.  I'm guessing the heat from the 47th match (hyperbole is the best thing ever) I struck evaporated the moisture enough to let the tobacco burn.  Then it swelled right up out of the top of the bowl and closed up any semblance of an air passage through the pipe. At that point I dumped the bowl, declared defeat, and smoked a pipeful of Dunhill Standard Mixture.

I decided further research was required before I wasted the rest of the ODF so I came begging to /r/pipetobacco for advice which I received.  Thanks to all involved.  After being informed of the Z fold I went and watched this video on youtube:

Which really made me feel stupid for my first attempt.  Nonetheless, I set out one single flake of ODF and let it air out for about an hour before I could sneak out to my spot and try it.  I packed the pipe exactly as the video demonstrated and managed to light the pipe on the second match.  

This...this is better.

The tobacco has a very rich, deep flavor.  Very smokey, very hearty.  It really reminded me of a full bodied maduro cigar, but smoother if that makes any sense.  I imagine it's a bit like a mouthful of smoke off a campfire which is being used to roast chili peppers.  I loved it.  My Dunhill Standard is very smooth and rich but not bitter.  It's just like a nice cup of coffee with a little cream and sugar.  The ODF is like a good shot of espresso...with pepper...but in a good way. My only complaint is mostly due to my own excitement over actually trying my new tin for real.  I forgot to bring a drink.  I didn't want to wander back into to get one, so I just dealt.  The ODF made me generate a ton of spit. That was a little strange.  Usually I have stout or porter with my pipe, so I may always do this and don't notice, but the ODF made me feel like a fountain of spittle.  It was worth it though.  I just puffed and spat, happy as a pig in shit for about 45 minutes until the bowl was done. Not the most gentlemanly way to enjoy your pipe but the hell with it, I wasn't out to impress anybody.

I'll be giving this to my students. 

As for the rest, thanks and glad you got it to work! I got the ready-rubbed version, which was probably a mistake, but I'll roll with it. Peterson's Irish Flake is one of my favs, so I'm looking forward to my second bowl of this sometime soon. 

I hope we'll see more reviews from you in the future!
