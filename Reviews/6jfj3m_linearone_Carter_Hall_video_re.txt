SmokeOnTheWater17: Nice review of a reliable, consistent blend. I mix CH with SV chocolate for a better burn and they work together in the taste department. I think the CH enhances the chocolate flavor a good bit. Still looking for a nice chocolate "English" that punches all of the buttons but this mix is not bad.

Kal-ElofKrypton: Good review. I use the PA to mix though, because I like the CH better on its own.

jazzghost: Really dismissed most of the drugstore brands due to smoking rolled Bugler back when I was broke in college. You convinced me to make up a new SP order. Now some Carter Hall and that grape stuff everyone keeps going on about is on its way... What's going on with this Powdered Toast Man you mentioned? I love Ren and Stimpy so the name alone has me intrigued.
