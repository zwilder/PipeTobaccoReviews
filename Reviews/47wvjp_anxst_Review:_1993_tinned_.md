Review: 1993 tinned Butera Blended Flake

It's finally becoming spring here in Minneapolis, so my pipe smoking sessions no longer involve shoveling snow or huddling in a corner out of the wind for a tiny bowl of something. It's 50 degrees and not much wind here today, so I decided to smoke some of the first aged tobacco I've ever purchased. In this case Butera Royal Vintage Blended Flake tinned in 1993 that I bought from /u/BillCarnes.

By the by, if you've not seen Bill's creations, take a look at http://www.clintonvilleleather.com/ for some fantastic leather products.

On opening, this tin was fantastic. Smells of aged vinegar with woody tobacco and old pressed flowers. After jarring the rest, I loosely packed my old Italian Author and sat in the sun on my front steps with a mug of warmed apple cider mixed with an ounce of Islay single malt mixed in and lit up.

As usual with large flake tobaccos, it took me a few lights to get things going, but even with those initial stop-start puffs I could tell this was amazing. I was met with sweet virginias with a lot of depth, and as the bowl progressed I started getting hints of the perique and orientals. A warm melange of softly spicy and sweet notes contrasted nicely with the smells of the sad earth as the last of the snow melted. It paired perfectly with the warm sweet smoky drink I had, and made for a great morning!

Having had this tobacco without age, I can definitely state that aging adds the depth this lacks when it's young without losing any of the brighter things it has. It maintains the floral sweetness and slight spiciness but has a much greater round woodiness and earthy character that really brings it together. If you have a chance to get some, go for it!

eurotrashcan: 56 degrees on saturday in minneapolis on a bench in loring park I smoked my first ever bowl. Irish Flake in my Cob. well half a bowl because I wanted to be able to walk after.

anxst: Nice! Was a great day for a pipe. What'd you think?
--
eurotrashcan: that it was. my post in piper university sums it up pretty well. a little frustrating, and a little exciting that there is some finesse and learning needed.
