Review: Sutliff Private Stock Metropolitain

**Blend Name:** Sutliff Private Stock Metropolitain

**Description on Tin:** Aromatic blend of golden Virginias, rich burleys and black Cavendish.

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish, Burley, Virginia

**Appearance:** Coarse ribbon cut. Mostly black to dark brown colored tobaccos with a comparatively smaller portion of light colored tobaccos. Somewhat moist in the tin.

**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla, almonds, honey, chocolate. The nuttiness is pronounced, but it is not the typical “tobacco” nuttiness you might be thinking of. More like a Ferrero Rocher type of smell, if that makes any sense. 

**Taste:** Vanilla is the strongest taste I get. Ever so slight nuttiness on the back end, but it’s very faint. A bit of honey and caramel sweetness is present as well. Not much aftertaste either, which I like. 

**Strength and Nicotine:** Nothing to see here. It’s like I’m just puffing on sweetly scented air. Move along now.

**Smokeability:** It’s smokeable. If I liked to smoke aromatics regularly I could see myself reaching for this once in a while. But then again most of the Sutliff vanilla-flavored aros kind of taste the same to me. This one doesn’t really stand out in any way. Like I’ve written before, it’s like drinking Bud or any other run of the mill American lager. Fine, but boring.

**Room Note:** Vanilla is the main note here. Not much else. Maybe a slight nuttiness as well. But very faint.

**Thoughts:** Another vanilla and honey flavored Sutliff aromatic. I can’t distinguish it from the others. I don’t think anyone can really do so in a blind taste test – maybe those super tasters that can tell the farm origin of different coffee beans or something. But I’m not one of those people.   

**Recommend to:** An aromatic smoker and/or someone that wants to smoke in front of non-smokers (girlfriends and wives primarily). Someone who wants to be reminded of grandpa’s aromatics.

**Summary:** A Sutliff vanilla-honey flavored aromatic with some nutty notes in the background. Like someone held two almonds above the tin and blew on them to give some of their scent to the tobacco. But there’s nothing remarkable about this blend other than how utterly boring it is. But hey, some people love plain vanilla ice cream too. This blend would be for them.

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a few weeks ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and received six tins of Sutliff Private Stock in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is the seventh of many that I'll be doing as part of the program!


====================================
Flatticus: Slow down, man, you're making me look bad.  Good review.  Have to disagree, though, plain vanilla ice cream done right is delicious.  This?  Well, anyway...

soymilkisgood: "Done right" is the key word. I'm not talking about Haagen Dazs or Ben and Jerry's here. I'm talking about store brand, artificial vanilla, buy it in the tub for $5 kind of vanilla ice cream.

Flatticus: Gross.

scriptonic: Don't you talk shit about plain french vanilla ice cream made with real vanilla pods. Don't you put that evil on me
