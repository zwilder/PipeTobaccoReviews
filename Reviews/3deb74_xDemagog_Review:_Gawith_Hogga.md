Review: Gawith Hoggarth's Licorice Flake
By: xDemagog
---

====================================
xDemagog: I'm gonna make this quick. 

**Smell:** dark, dank, sticky fire cured tobaccos. A rich tobacco sweetness. You can almost get a licorice scent, but really it's just that leathery smell you get from dark fired tobaccos. 

**Look:** dark, dank, sticky flake. Mottled with bits of brown. It's a good looking flake if you like em dark.  

**Taste:** dark, dank, dirty fire cured Virginias

**Room note:** I dare not smoke this in a room

*No licorice whatsoever to the point that I'm gonna ask Glynn if I got the right stuff or not. I know for a fact it's the GH Dark Flake with a topping, but none that I can detect (not even Lakeland floral). The after taste was reminiscent of your cigar chewing uncle's breath and I think I'm kinda done with fire cured tobaccos, retrohaling irritates my sinuses. I will say, for being so wet and sticky (surprising moist and tacky), it dries out and smokes incredibly easy.*

**Meh/10**

Anybody in the UK fancy a trade?

emblemparade: If you're interested in licorice flavoring, I recommend Esoterica's Blackpool.
--
LegesAequitas: It doesn't sound too terrible to me although I must say I'm very fond of licorice and would like to taste it when it's mentioned. Let me know what Glynn says when he gets back to you. Thanks for the review, bud. : )

====================================
nvaus: Thanks for the review. I'm a fan of black licorice tobacco and it's hard to come by. I probably would have ordered this had I seen it before. Hopefully they improve the licorice and I can try it later.
--
PipeBeard: Me too! Have you tried Orlik Dark Strong Kentucky?  It has a definite black licorice topping, which REALLY comes through in the tin note.  There are only faint notes of it through the smoke, but its still a great blend.
--
BWeice: I just had a bowl of DSK.. I didn't care for it my first two bowls but I actually had a chance to sit down and relax and take my time with it.. I wouldn't say it wow'ed me still but the kentucky finally showed its flavors and made it a heck of an enjoyable smoke 2 of those little flakes lasted 2 hours. The tin note is **fantastic!** It may need some deep aging which I think I'll let it sit a while
--
PipeBeard: Yeah, I'm really interested to see how it does with some age.  I'm with you, I've enjoyed it much more as I've slowed it down.
--
nvaus: I have not, I'll put it on my list!
--
BeggingforQuestions: Just interested, what tobaccos would you recommend that have the black licorice flavoring? I'm a big fan of the candy and wouldn't mind trying a tobacco form of it.
--
nvaus: The only good one I've found so far is just called Black Licorice from Paul's Pipes in Flint Michigan. Actually even that doesn't have a whole lot of licorice flavor, but it's sweet and has a good scent. Probably nothing more than black cavendish and some licorice flavoring.
--
BeggingforQuestions: Wow! I swear half the guys on this subreddit are from Michigan! I live in the Detroit area so I might just have to stop by this "Paul's Pipes" place the next time I'm out that way!

facestab: Damn. I wanted this one to be good.

jarvis400: Detect any dankness?

Thanks for the ~~warning~~ review!
--
xDemagog: I should say, if you like GH Dark Flake then you shouldn't have any issues liking this stuff at all. 

Edit: a word
--
jarvis400: Thanks, DF was actually my first thought from your review.

Dark Flake used to be one of my regular smokes, but around five, six years ago it started to taste acrid and austere and vile. Something had changed. Probably just my tastes. I can't take large amount of burleys of any type anymore.

====================================
SupraMario: That looks soo freaking tasty, sucks that its no good.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Quick and dirty - I like it!
