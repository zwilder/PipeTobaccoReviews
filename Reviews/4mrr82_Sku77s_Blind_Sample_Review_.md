Blind Sample Review #1

Paging u/antiwittgenstein

It's been a while but life has settle enough for me to get to these reviews in some fashion.

I've decided to do the blind reviews first so everyone knows my horrid palette and can discount any thing I post with the word review in it from now on.

I won't be using the proper review template as I'm going of notes I had taken.

Blend Name: Blind Sample #1

Leaf: A fine cut flake finer than most. Light colored Va around some slightly darker leaf.

Tin Aroma: Slightly of rum and sweet VA, I hate how badly bags seem to convey tin note. 

Taste: Almost light VA that burned a little bitey for me. I can't say I tasted perique because after my perique sampler my taste buds for spice were a little shot. There was something there though maybe my pipe was ghosted but I was getting some spice.

Smokability: A fine smoke, steady burning and a nice flake when rubbed out, nicer when stuffed. Smoke slow to avoid it nip though.

Room Note: a ciggerettey VA smell, with a slightly acrid fruit note.

Thoughts: My guess is Dunhills Navy Flake. Best shot I can give it after a month.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Pretty dang close, it was Comoy's Cask No. 4, which is a light navy flake as well. Good review, keep em coming - your palate will grow as your write these things up.

Sku77s: So close ha ha. Well that was the first Comoy's I've ever smoked so mistaking it for another tobacco from England is bad huh.

antiwittgenstein: I mean you got the exact style right and hit some of the same notes I found in [my review](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/3943wz/tobacco_review_comoys_cask_no4/). There is a bit of perique and spice in that which you picked up on. It isn't a blend that gets much notice, which is a shame because I think it is just as good if not better than the PS VA flakes and Newminster Navy Flake. I only gave it a ++ on my review, but I smoke quite a bit of this stuff still, which is remarkable as I try to keep my rotation open for stuff I am in the process of reviewing, but sometimes I just want a no nonsense sweet Virginia which is practically free.
