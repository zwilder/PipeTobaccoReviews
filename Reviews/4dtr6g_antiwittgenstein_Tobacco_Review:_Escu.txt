Tobacco Review: Escudo
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 66

**Blend Name:** Escudo
 
**Description on Tin:** A combination of full bodied Virginia from North Carolina and Virginia blended with Perique from Louisiana are the cornerstones in Escudo. The blend is pressed and matured before it is spun and cut into coins. This process ensures the unique character of “Escudo”

**Leaf:** Classic bullseye shape. 
 
**Tin Aroma:** Fruity, a bit rotten and musty. Winey, like malbec I guess. 

**Taste:** Fruit and hay. Well isn’t this Springy? I’m gonna put on a little Tallest Man on Earth. Yeah, that’s the ticket. Where were we? Fruit – apricot and pluminess. I would only know to call this apricot because of Erinmore and this tastes very much like Erinmore at the moment. The plums, as always are shoved down in the bottom, a base note you have to go searching for, but you know it is there keeping time. And Orlik Golden Sliced, almost an exact impersonation. Just a slight bit hotter, I mean spicy. A surprising amount of pepper in this flake. Previous smokes had the spice much more low key. I suppose all the Perique was isolated, to give a concentrated burst. I like this a bit better than my previous forays when the spice was just a vague haunting flavor from light to dottle. Lager. That is a new note for me in a pipe tobacco, but really, lager – creamy, a bit sweet, a bit sour. Actually, maybe more like a very light IPA. Which I generally hate, but this is rather refreshing and pleasant, the fruit, sour, and touch of rubbery bitterness comes together. I was really on the edge of smoking something else today, but this is a perfect for this kind of early Spring day. The pepper fades from its peak, but it is there and much stronger than I remember. I’ve let these flakes dry out a bit more, so maybe the moisture content is at the heart of the difference?  Towards the end I wish I had a larger VaPer pipe – the Virginias grow richer, some red wine vinegar, and it sweetens a bit. It is never quite sweet as say OGS or most McClelland VAs, but enough to lift up the experience, like the sweetness of a corn chip or a saltine cracker. Those last few puffs are huge and rich, but I’m at the perfect level of relaxed and at peace with the mess I’ve made of things, so I suppose this was the right size bowl after all.

**Nicotine:** I’m gonna float the idea of a (personal, but you can use it if you feel it is useful) more standardized scale of nicotine.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

Escudo is a perfect 3.

I know y’all to be a reticient bunch, ahem, so any comments on the above scale would be appreciated, as the idea is to have this convey information to *you* about how strong each blend is, relative to some common benchmarks.

**Smokability:** Delightful. I crumble these into a mess and gravity feed. Lights easily and usually cherries up nicely.
 
**Room Note:** Cigarettes and coffee, minus the coffee.

**Thoughts:** Let me make some people mad: This shouldn’t be used as the Standard of VaPers as it often is referred to. It is very good mind you, but it doesn’t have that keystone touch. I think a Standard should be sort of a median experience from which you can swim out in any direction and not be caught unawares by what lies beyond. Escudo is far too mild for that sort of position. I would say McClelland 2015 VaPer Flake is more of a representative experience, at least for the 10 or so Vapers I have explored thus far. Maybe that is even unfair because the ribbon VaPers and flake VaPers have such different flavor profiles. Anyway, this falls somewhere between Orlik Golden Sliced and the 2015, closer to the former than the latter.

As I smoked more of this I noticed that the flavor profile changed as I let it get drier and drier. The first bowls were malty, hay like, and altogether bland. Slowly they became spicier, tangier, deeper, and just better. My final bowl out of what I reserved to review from was probably the best. Smoke it however you like, but be forewarned your moisture level is going to drastically change your experience in a way I have not really seen in another flake.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Orlik Golden Sliced, McClelland 2015, Court of St. James, Erinmore Flake
 
**Summary:** A fruity-peppery-malty smokable IPA.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

====================================
Nipsmagee: Just wanna say, I'm In Love with my Car is one of my favorite Queen songs. 
--
antiwittgenstein: These rating systems have a natural bias of course. But you must have huffed one too many cans of starter fluid to enjoy that song...
--
====================================
crimblade: Well done on the Queen Discography ranking! I'm just curious where "I Want to Break Free" would squeeze in there.

Oh yeah, the review was pretty spot on to my thoughts about Escudo when it was rubbed out. Did you ever try it with fold and stuff? I felt it gave a better flavor journey thanks to the perique being all condensed in the center.

I dig the Nicotine rating scale, gives a much more descriptive air to what someone means instead of just low/medium/high. 

Your reviews are always a highlight of my day!
--
first-capri: Completely agree.  /u/antiwittgenstein reviews are superb!
--
antiwittgenstein: You are really too kind.
--
antiwittgenstein: That is really too kind of you. Sorry these have been sparse of late - illness, changing jobs and all that. I am going to do my best to get back an almost weekly schedule. 

I actually never gave fold'n'stuff a try - I half the other half the tin jarred up for the future - I will make sure to give it a go when I come back around to it. 

I think "I Want to Break Free" could easily be a +++. They have such a big body of work, much of it excellent, some of it midling to terrible, that I could easily do another one of these. I would just have to delve a bit deeper.
--
====================================
FullFrontalNoodly: I recently opened my first tin of Escudo and have had a very similar experience so far.  I too found it far too mild and lacking in both body and spiciness, providing a very cigarettey room note, and finicky WRT moisture content.  Normally I prefer to smoke my Virginias on the moist side as I find this provides the best flavor but this is most definitely not the case here.

As a matter of personal preference I'm much more a fan stronger blends like Firestorm and OJK.  In terms of the milder VaPers I've tried so far McClelland 2015 is probably my favorite smoke.  I have heard it gets much better with age and maybe I will pick up another tin for that purpose but otherwise I could completely do without, which really isn't so bad considering the price.


--
====================================
Comintern: I love Escudo it's easily my favourite blend of the moment. Just perfect bread-y, hay with some sweetness and nice pops of pepper.
--
====================================
Prsop2000: I seem to be one of the few who don't like escudo. Tastes very cigarettey to me and smells like cheap Raisin Bran in the tin.

Wasn't a fan so I gifted the rest to a buddy of mine that loves the stuff. 
--
====================================
PeskyPrussian: I find your reviews to be pretty accurate to my tastes, and also extremely enjoyable to read.  I've thought about putting up some reviews of my own, but I'm waiting until I feel like I can put effort and thought into them that you and some of the others do in this sub.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks and I am glad they are at least somewhat accurate - It is really difficult to know if what I am tasting is close to what others are tasting. Do we even see the same shade of blue? I would say go ahead and start, even a poor review on /r/pipetobacco is better than none at all, and the fact that you *want* to write good ones makes it less likely you will do so. You won't just enrich the sub, every review you write really cements your tobacco knowledge and experience. I pay attention to everything I taste, but when I am writing a review, I am fully engaged with the smoke in a way I am not any other time. It is the difference between kissing the back of your hand and paying for a real live girl.

====================================
icookthefood: Great review as always!!  I like the nicotine addition, that will be great for many smokers.  Personally I seem to be immune to heavy nicotine for the most part which has been nice, it awesome to sip on Old Joe Krantz for an hour and a half and even though its pretty much a nicotine IV drip it doesn't get to me much.   I'll have to say I absolutely devoured a La Palina KBII the other day and by the end could feel some affect from it, but that sucker had the most smoke I've experienced on the draw in a long time, I was in smoke heaven, definitely box worthy...sorry, I know I'm not on /r/cigars, back to pipe stuff now.  My experience with Escudo is very close to yours, it was my first Virginia and put me on the path I was looking for in pipe tobacco, but I've lately gone in the direction of VaBurPer's.
--
antiwittgenstein: I will have to look that La Palina up - I still burn a stick every week or so. What VaBurPers have you had? I've been going with more and more burley oriented blends, despite being fairly sensitive to our Lady N and would like to know what I should cellar.
--
icookthefood: I've been loving C&D's Old Joe Krantz but recently had GLP Cumberland and was smitten.  I just commented on this a day or so ago that its like OJK's sophisticated brother, quite delicious.  After a week of smoking mostly Cumberland(and lots of Bayou Morning) I went back to OJK and loved it, I was really afraid the Cumberland was going to spoil me.  I'm stoked, I love having options.  If you find yourself picking up anything up I'd suggest trying Bayou Morning as another option if you like C&D's perique, its a VaPer and I am loving it more and more as it sits in its jar.

I got some Haunted Bookshop in this morning and smoked some and I have to say it didn't grab me from the outset like OJK, but I'll give it some time.  It seemed pretty dry and didn't have near the nose of Old Joe(which upon receiving reminded me of a chocolate brownie on my first smell, intoxicating).  I still enjoyed it though and can't wait to see what happens with a little time on it.  
--
====================================
first-capri: I really like your "Standard of VaPers" summation and found this portion of your review most beneficial as I enjoy a good strong VaPer, Perique strong that is.  Heavy in the Perique is not common in blends though, unless 10% is heavy for the smoker.  I like [Exclusive](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/pipe-tobacco/97538/cornell-diehl-exclusive/#p-188259)'s 50% of Perique, now this is heavy.  I am thinking of making my own mixture with something like 60% Perique, 20% Latakia, and 20% Smyrna.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the recommendation, I will have to check that out some time - though I find Bayou Morning already a bit overbearing on the pepper... But I don't always smoke just what I think I will like.
--
====================================
forwormsbravepercy: I loved reading this.  As a newish smoker: what do you mean by "gravity feed"? Do you mean that you don't tamp it down at all when filling your pipe? 
--
antiwittgenstein: Yes, basically. When you have flake and you rub it gently out or cross cut it with scissors you often end up with little chunks instead of fine ribbon. These burn slow and beautifully, but shouldn't be compacted because of air flow and such.
--
====================================
mk_bway: I love reading your reviews for the great tobacco content, but also for the various reviews embedded in your rating systems.

I'll have to write up my own review of Escudo some time. I was a little hesitant when I first cracked the tin but I warmed up to it. It's a very interesting smoke.
