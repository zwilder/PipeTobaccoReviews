Review: St. Condor Flake-ish
By: Hopton-Wafers

Background: I recently tried St. Bruno flake and, though I enjoyed it, I found it a little wanting for my tastes. Also, being a fan of Condor green (thanks, grandfather) I had recently tried Condor long cut and found it an enjoyable variation.

Insanity: what, I wondered, would happen if I took the two and smoked them together.

Method: take about half of a flake each of St. Bruno and Condor long cut, fold, and stuff.

Pipes used: MM cob & briar.

Results: wow! It has all the freshness of St. Bruno with the addition of a mild floralness from the Condor. It burns well, doesn't need a relight, and, with care, lasts for about an hour.

Warning: about half-way or so through the bowl, you may well find that Uncle N comes to visit, tapping you on the shoulder, removing the top of your head, and leaving you to gibber in a satisfied puddle. You have been warned.

Conclusion: a mad idea that worked well. Now, if I could just find some perique flake to add to this mixture...

carnesy: Not bad but your review could really be improved. Try the subs [pre-made template](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/wlexj/tobacco_review_template/) next time to really go in depth. Using this will make you think more about what your smoking and help you cover aspects of the tobacco you may never have thought of.

xDemagog: St. Bruno and Gold Block mixed in equal parts make for a great smoke.
