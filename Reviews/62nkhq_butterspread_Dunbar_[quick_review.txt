Dunbar [quick review]
By: butterspread
---
I managed to procure an 8oz bag of Dunbar. I'm finishing the first bowl just now. Fresh out of the bag, I got a heap of gold and yellow wide cut ribbon with bits of darker strands here and there. Tin note: fresh grass, very sweet. The leaf is rather wet and definitely needs some drying time. I let it sit for about 45 minutes. It was still rather moist for my liking when I put light to it. I was reather careful not to pack it to tight into my Savinelli Roma Canadian. Took 3 matches to light. Once going though, it kept going with no relights. For the first half of the bowl I only tasted the Virginias. Perique only came to play later on and nicely spiced things up. I really like this stuff. Very bright room note (or as is my case, shed note). It tastes very very similar to SG Cabbie's Mixture but it's much more delicate, much more refined. Just finishing my bowl now and it starts getting a little bit ashy but I didn't get a slightest bite out of it, which I was a little afraid of. The smoke is rich and creamy and there is plenty of it. I like this a lot and will be smoking it sparingly. A really good quality tobacco. If you are into VaPers and have a chance to grab a tin or a bag, then this is a definite "must have".
====================================
majkeli: I don't really like it that much fresh, but let it sit around for a few years and it's just fantastic.
