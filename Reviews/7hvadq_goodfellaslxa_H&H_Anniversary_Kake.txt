H&H Anniversary Kake, quick review

I bought a few tins of Anniversary Kake for the first time a few weeks ago when it came back into stock. I smoked a few bowls while it was still a bit too moist, and didn't find it special. I have since dried my tin out with a few silica packs (#swamplife) and wow, the flavor has become abundant. Smoking some in a CAO meer bent dublin (2nd bowl tonight) and really enjoying it. Smooth, chocolaty. Now I understand why they can't keep it in stock. 

Medium burning temp, but probably needs a bit more drying. No bite. Stays lit quite well. All around great smoke.
====================================
antiwittgenstein: This is one of the few tins I've actually finished. I think it fills in a pretty large gap in the burley rainbow, from the featherweight Prince Albert to the heavyweight Haunted Bookshop, Old Joe Krantz, and Solani Aged Burley flake crowd. The only thing I've had that was comparable is the now discontinued MacBaren London Mixture.

SupraMario: Wait Anni Kake burley? I thought it was a VaPer?
--
brainskan13: Confirmed. Ain't no burley in Anni Kake.
--
antiwittgenstein: You know what - I had some drinks. I read *Burley Kake*. Shame points to me. Anni Kake is amazing too. My apologies...
--
SupraMario: Lol don't worry, I pulled the same thing, on the VaPers thread
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Stuff like this makes me love this sub.

====================================
brainskan13: Anniversary Kake ages VERY nicely too.

====================================
zero-hunter: Ah, Anni Kake. From my first light of it, I remember thinking, "Now this is a VaPer."

ellandrydroid: I just smoked a bowl of the 2015 in my Falcon  and it was good and smooth

TKColo: I love love love the smell of the tin. Everytime I open it, I think this is the time. and then I smoke it and it burns the crap out of me. Worse than anything else I have. Even when I truly just barely sip it. Wet or dry. It's a head scratcher. I think I have a body chemistry aversion to it or something. It smells like the perfect pipe tobacco to me.
--
goodfellaslxa: I'll say that I got burned on my first smoke. I think it's pretty well cased in PG. Leaving it open overnight did nothing to the moisture level. Now, silica packets for 2 days really helped. No burn and a lot more flavor.
