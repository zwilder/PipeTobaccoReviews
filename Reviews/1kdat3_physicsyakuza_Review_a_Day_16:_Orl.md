Review a Day 16: Orlik Golden Sliced
By: physicsyakuza
---
I clearly have a strange definition of per day with these reviews but it's sometimes hard to find time to sit down, smoke and review in my day of super science. 

Also, big thanks to Scrubzyy for the slices. I've never had this (for some strange reason) and I couldn't turn down finally getting my hands on some. Onwards!

Blend name: Orlik Golden Sliced

Tin description: A blend of golden, fully ripe Virginia and a little Perique. Naturally sweet.

Aroma: I'm a little stuffed up, but I'm getting floral notes and dried apricots.

Appearance: Looks like the cross section of a fun size candy bar. 

Z packed nicely into my Peterson Darwin Deluxe. Fit one flake perfectly

Taste:
Initial: Surprisingly light. Berry notes with a slightly fermented, mushroom note (thanks perique!). Hints of hay and floral notes.

Mid: The VA hay is really dominating here. It's sweet, but dry. A demi-sec I'd say. The perique is there, but more of a mouthfeel (creamy) than a flavor.

Mid-Mid: upon relight, WOW, this really pops. The perique is back with some flavor. Nice, slightly sour (SLIGHTLY) with some nice almost toasted oat sweetness from the VA. Picking up to a solid medium body.

Final: Bright leather tones, nutty hay and a nice, round body. Certainly complex, but you can most definitely enjoy this while working or doing other distracting activities. 

Thoughts: I'm always surprised I've never had this before and I can see why it's widely considered one of the best out there. Forgiving and a definite nice introduction to the wonderful world of VaPer without having to worry about the bite. 

PS. I made this my breakfast smoke and paired it with milk. It actually tastes kind of good... Milk clearly was a great choice

farglesnuff: earl grey is my fav pairing with this so far

somedumbjerk: Try lady grey. I don't like tea a lot but man do they pair well. Also rye with a splash of bitters but I tend to smoke OGS in the morning.

mimefrog: I thought the topping on this stuff tasted like lemon Pledge.  Will revisit after a few months of aging.
