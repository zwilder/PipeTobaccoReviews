[Review] Tabac Manil Semois - La Brumeuse
By: claypainter
---
/u/levins0 sent me a sample of this and below is a review.  
  
**Tin Note:** Shoving my sniffer into the bag, I get light cocoa, funk, and wait... What? Grandma's basement couch?! Hard to describe the scent because it is so different.  
  
**Appearance:** I grab a pinch of the Semois and I suddenly think that I may have been sucked into George Orwell's 1984, and this is a recent shipment from the Ministry of Plenty. It is brown, monochromatic, and good grief it is DRY.  
  
**Taste:** I have had 4 bowls of this. And when people say that it isn't like any other tobacco, they are not kidding. I packed it tight, as advised, you get cocoa, herbal notes, the things that keep jumping to my mind are bell pepper, wintergreen, fancy-pants-cucumber-water, and maybe a slice of radish. On the retrohale I get pepper similar to perique. Completely unique and completely satisfying to my palate.  
  
**Random Thoughts:** People say pack it tight, and do so. I am skeptical that there is a too tight for this tobacco. Don't use your finger; Use a tamper and pack that stuff down! It will want to burn fast - If you have the time, don't let it and be gentle on the draw. The bassier notes come out more on the gentle draw and the vegetable and herbs on the bigger draws. Both are pleasant. I really like this as a morning smoke... like a lot. This may be the only blend that I dedicate 1 single pipe to, because it is just so out there. I have been smoking it in a cob, but cobs aren't my favorite.  
  
Did I like it? Yes. Did I order a brick? Yes. 
  
**edit** It can be overpacked. My fresh Semois with slightly higher moisture content, still needed to be packed tight, but not as tight.
====================================
zero-hunter: Excellent review. How is the nic hit?
--
claypainter: Thanks, man. For me, it is medium to medium-high.
--
RustyShackleford09: And for me a mild to medium. Maybe I need to smoke bigger bowls of it. 
--
claypainter: No need to do that. It seems nic in different blends affect people differently.

My medium to medium-high means that I feel the buzz and sometimes during the last parts of the bowl, I get a small lump in the throat.

zero-hunter: I'm pretty sensitive to N. But damn I want to try this.

====================================
Witch_Hammer: Semois is something else, and really not expensive when you realize how much you're not paying for moisture weight. This stuff is so dry it seems to be about 20% greater by volume than other tobaccos -- one 100g brick filled five 4oz jars to the brim for me, whereas two tins of other tobaccos I've had would fill four or less.
