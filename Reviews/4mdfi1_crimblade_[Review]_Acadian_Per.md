[Review] Acadian Perique
By: crimblade

**Blend Name:** HH Arcadian Perique

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** This blend includes Virginia, Burley, original Cavendish, dark fired Kentucky, Oriental and of course a fair amount of Perique. The HH Acadian Perique has no top flavor at all which means that you will only enjoy the tobacco taste. When smoked you will experience no tongue bite and this blend will smoke to the bottom, leaving only dry ashes. it is a rich, flavorful and very satisfying smoke.

**Leaf:** Virginia/Perique, ribbon cut. Beautiful Dark and tan ribbons are solidly packed, moisture content seems perfect right from the tin.

**Tin Aroma:** Smokey with a hint of bread. Slight pepper if inhaled deeply, which I did rather frequently. Very light and relaxing, a perfect fit to the hot summer evening I first opened it on and the subsequent smokes since. 

**Taste:** A gentle spice with a background of sweet smoke. Occasionally a darker nutty flavor will whisper in amidst the light earth of the smoke. Cool on the retrohale with only the bare hint of burning spice. The occasional touch of citrus will pop in and disappear just as quickly making you wonder if it was even there in the first place. In the background there's the taste of wood burning, not the smokey burn of latakia but cleaner. The balance of the flavors is outstanding with no one overpowering the others, all of them working together to make for a perfect summer smoke. This is one tobacco where the sum of all the whole truly outweighs the sum of the parts.

**Smokability:** Straight from the tin it burns easy with no hint of tongue bite. It burns down to a fine grey ash. I have yet to experience any dottle, or gurgle in smoking it. It does need the occasional relight but this is probably as likely from my lack of attention at times to the tobacco burning out.

**Room Note:** Burning wood, like the smell of burning wood, simply good clean smoke.

**Thoughts:** I got this tin based on it's description alone, as it intrigued me. Since getting it I had forgotten that it was a VaPer, though some reviews I read since describe it as a Va Bur Per. I don't have enough familiarity with the qualities that Burley lends to a smoke but I'm aware enough to notice the differences between this and other VaPers I've had. I enjoyed this tobacco from the moment I opened the tin.  I actually opened it on a whim since with all the hotter weather I wanted something other than the english blends I tend to prefer. This one seemed to just seem right and was intriguing enough at the time that I popped it open. Each time I've smoked it I've had no trouble with it in packing, smoking, or in any other aspect. It's just good. The nicotine hit is pretty much right where I want it to be able to enjoy and evening in the back yard without being knocked useless for the rest of the night/evening. The tin was dated Feb 2015 so I'm not sure how much the year of aging it had changed it but this is one that I plan on keeping in the cellar for summer evenings in years to come. There was no dry mouth afterwards, simply a pleasant smokey taste that reminded me of the relaxation that had come before. Even the scent on clothing was nothing but the clean smoke of burning wood. 

**Recommend to:** VaPer lovers, possibly those who enjoy a Burley aspect to their smoke, but again my inexperience with Burley keeps me from making this a definite. 

**Summary:** This is a great balanced blend with a lot of flavor that just works right together. It's excellent for a warm summer evening spent relaxing. It pairs perfectly with a Saison, I found it also went really well with a Gose. After smoking it the first time I ceased to regret not purchasing another tin of Escudo Navy Deluxe, this was better. 

**Final Rating:** 4/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for a year and a half with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Mortons Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
ClarkTwain: It's between this, Irish oak, or Peterson's perfect plug for my next tin. You may have convinced me. Great review!
--
crimblade: You're welcome, glad you liked it. Those two are on my wish list as well
--
====================================
hvywldrnss: IMHO a short year did wonders for this blend. I detested this one fresh but quite enjoy it now. Could be my palate though. 
--
crimblade: Part of me wants to try it fresh but I enjoy it so much now that I'll probably only ever smoke it once it has at least a year under its belt.

====================================
None: I've been wanting to try this blend, I enjoy VaPer and love DFK, Peter Heinricks Strong Dark Flake is my 10/10. thanks for the review
--
crimblade: I haven't tried either of those yet but I read several reviewers comparing Acadian to DFK.
