Jake's Tasty Kake (Review)

I've been wanting to write this for weeks, but life would not allow it. Now, since there's a lull in my workflow, I'm finally getting to it. 

First off, I sincerely appreciate u/djscollin4 for providing the sample of his creation. To be honest, I couldn't even remember what it was when I received it, and once I realized that, I didn't want to look it up because I thought it would make for a more honest experience and review. 

I received two bowls worth, which I smoked in a Missouri Meerschaum Mark Twain on both accounts. 

The tobacco was dark and moist, just how I like my women and Croc whores. The smell was sweet and tangy. The leaves were thick and appeared to be a pretty rough cut; not easy to rub out, and I only gave it a brief shot to see how it did with rubbing out, but wound up folding and stuffing it. 

Lighting was tricky. The first bowl's worth was left out for a day to dry. It required a couple charring lights before I could get a true light. The second bowl's worth was left out to dry for 3 days, and it, too, required a couple of charring lights before I could get a true light. After that true light though...

Tang was the first thing that hit my tastebuds, followed by sweetness that complimented it perfectly. A very mild zestiness followed on the retrohale. It was pleasant, and I knew right off I was working with a good deal of Virginia. Red and orange Virginia specifically. (Later confirmed to have yellow in there as well.)
A few more puffs into it, and I realized I was paying close attention to the flavor without trying to discern anything in particular. I was just enjoying it. Experiencing it. 

The first third of the bowl stayed this way. The flavor was consistently dancing around between sweet and tangy. Sometimes, a little zest. 
The second third of the bowl actually became even better. The flavor was richer, and the sweet and tanginess melded into one delicious smoke, while a slight peppery spice started to crawl in, especially on the retrohale. 
"Mm..." would involuntarily escape me every few minutes, and the book I brought with me to read was still sitting on the table. 
The final third was spicier, and required a lighter sip to tolerate, but was by no means a turn-off. The sweet/tang was still there, and here is where all the flavors played nicely together, and the tobacco shone its brightest. 
This was consistent throughout both bowls.

The leaf burned perfectly, through-and-through. There was absolutely no dottle in the end, and this goes for both smokes. I'd pay for this tobacco without a doubt. I'm not even a VaPer guy. Just wonderful stuff.    



====================================
Alligator_Gar: As one of the few people *in the world* to have tried JTK, I absolutely concur with your findings. This is a ‘pound in the cellar’ blend that will be phenomenal in a year or two and smoked great fresh. Proof that simple ingredients and careful blending can result in complex, captivating tastes.

djscollin4: Glad you enjoyed it!  Think I figured out the moisture and cut issues with my next 2 blends I made...much easier to prepare and light!

Alligator_Gar: If you feel so inclined, PM your recipe. I’m needing some more JTK and I’ll make it myself, if I must.

SupraMario: Sounds like a great VaPer! Nice review.

djscollin4: Thanks for doing a review for me!  I have the rest sitting in a cool dark place to forget about for a year...I really liked the way it turned out.  I’m hoping that the age blends the flavors together and mellows the  VAs out a bit.  I also made a straight VA plug that is damn good fresh that will definitely benefit from some age.  Maybe I’ll be sending some of both out next year to a select few!  Glad you enjoyed it!

ThePipeSigh: Hey, it was my pleasure, man. Good stuff. Thanks again.

coldsolderjoint: I am sorry that I never wrote a proper review of JTK, but this stuff was good! 
--
djscollin4: I appreciate the input that you gave me in PMs!  Narrowing down my blend to be much more balanced and enjoyable!  More to come...

badmongo666: I'd piggybacked my review on another one, but agreed all around - I really liked my sample.
