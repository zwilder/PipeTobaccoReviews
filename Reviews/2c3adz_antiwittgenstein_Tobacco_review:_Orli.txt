Tobacco review: Orlik Golden Sliced

Review #3

**Blend Name:** Orlik Golden Sliced

**Description on Tin:**  A touch of Perique adds zesty new life to the flavor of flue-cured Virginia tobacco. Tobacco cut: Traditional flake slice cut. Tobacco Flavor/Aroma: This attractive, non-aromatic blend encompasses a delectable span of flavor intensities from mild to medium in strength. 

**Leaf:** Like thin pressed shredded wheat. 

**Tin Aroma:** Sweet raisins and fresh red grapes.

**Taste:** As soon as you light it, the OGS starts proslytizing. It is immediately full flavored - virginia sweetness, with a high twang, touched maybe by citrus. On the second puff the perique sets in, with a distinct black pepper note. This in not one of those perique blends that you don't see the pepper till after the intermission, this thing is upfront about things here too. By the third puff you get hit with the base note. The pepper is there, the lemony zest of the bright va is there, but this is the tobacco, and it is letting itself be known. It is a thumping dark note, mysterious and complex. Sometimes it seems be earthy, something like deep burley, sometimes like dark, dark, virginia, sometimes like stewed fruits, the raisins the tin note sing of. It presents itself, bats an eye, then goes whirling off, coming back in the next puff, or the puff after that. The apperance of this tobacco is misleading - if you are naive enough, like me, to conflate light colored with lightly flavored - as is the name, if again you think 'Golden' implies nothing but sunshine and flowers and pretty girls in sundresses. No, this is a pastoral, but one written by Beethoven. The violins are there, singing high and pure one moment, but in the next the rains come, with drums and basoons, cellos, chasing you from your idyll of quite contemplation with this brooding tobacco smoke. But you chase back, hoping to discover its secrets. You chase until you feel your tongue begin to curdle, then you slow down, you sip. You think about the way the light holds itself in the summer sky and wonder what October will bring this year, but you do this as a ploy, as you delve deeper, slower and more cautiously, but still it goes, high and low, spicy and sweet, until the bowl ends and you are more mystified than ever.

**Smokability:** I tried folding it this way and that. Z, W, in halves, in quarters, square knots, celtic crosses. Nothing doing. I rub it out or twist and cut into cubes. Gravity fill and tap works best. Takes a bit to light. Still have to relight. I don't care. It is worth the hassle. I dry it 15-30 min. Maybe a bit longer would make it an easier puff.

**Room Note:** Always too distracted to tell. My apologies.

**Thoughts:** I think I already spent myself. This is the kind of tobacco I will smoke and think about the rest of the day. The next day. Really I will keep thinking about it until I smoke it again. I am smitten. It is complex and tasty, and never shy with its flavors. I am smoking this basically unaged. I need to stash away a tin or ten to see what happens with some years on it.

**Summary:** For the moment, I have not had, nor can conceive, a better virginia. If you have not had it yet, try this the next time you TAD.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

**Rating:** +++++

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (The Mill on the Floss)

(----)This is suffering (The Mysteries of Udlopho - 1794, but close enough)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Wuthering Heights)
====================================
LegesAequitas: Hey there, thanks for the review. We really don't see them often enough. Also, you have quite a unique review system. I must admit that I haven't read all of those, but I remember loathing Wuthering Heights. Those Bildungsroman tales often just bore me as I have trouble relating to them. Although I have come to like Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park. There is a very distinct type of humor that is entertaining but can be hard to acquire.

antiwittgenstein: Glad you enjoyed it. I am going to try to at least one of these a week until I run out of new tobaccos. Its good for the community and it really gets me to think about what - and how - I am smoking.

The up and down scale helps clarify things for me - some things you just don't like - which are hard to place on any of the traditional scales.

I liked all of Austen, saving her 1st (Lady Susan) - that dry, biting satire is delicious. Northanger Abbey is actually a mocking parody of those wretched Gothic Romances so popular at the time - and as always, the vapid young women who read them. 

Elizabeth Gaskell - came a full generation later, but did a similar number on the Victorian self denial in Cranford. Think sort of female-Thackery in the English country side.

LegesAequitas: You've given me something to think about. I haven't picked up these kinds of books in quite a while. Which other tobaccos should we be expecting in the future?
--
antiwittgenstein: I have a couple of dunhills, a few mcclellands, another h&h, a PS, etc.; all pretty well evenly split between english and va. Then I have 3 fairly popular aros, and a couple of pure burley blends. So roughly 20 or so in all.

====================================
PipingaintEZ: OGS is one of my all time favorite tobaccos and I never let my supply dwindle! Your review was poignant and potentially very informative for someone wanting to try this blend out. Bravo!
