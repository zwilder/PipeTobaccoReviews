Quick Review: Gawith Black Irish X.
By: TacticalBro
---
A redditor here hooked me up with this beast of a tobacco, along with a grab bag MM legend and some delicious smelling plum pudding. 

I cut a few coins off the rope with a cigar cutter, and rubbed all but 2 into shag, basically. After 10 minutes of drying, I layered from bottom to top, shag, coin, shag, coin, shag, packed loosely enough to allow expansion of the pressed tobacco(See pics in comments) 

Charring light ensues. As I allow the pipe to go out to get my "smoking light" I tried to explore the flavors in my mouth, hoping for that beef jerky taste, I found myself thinking how funny the human mouth. I then realized that I couldn't feel my legs. 

I told myself "don't be a little Nancy boy" (new years resolution not to curse" and summed it up to being in my head. 

I gave it a light again. Tamped it out almost immediately, will try again after breakfast. This tobacco kicked my ass. It is exactly what I asked for. It smells terrible when lit, tastes like unsalted, peppered jerky and raw nuts and should be perfect for bad moods. 

Certainly not an everyday smoke, but I can see myself smoking that in the mountains of Virginia, after consuming a large amount of bacon and bread and eggs. 
====================================
VonSausage: Ha! I was tellin ya, man. Crazy nicotine.
--
TacticalBro: I've smoked since I was 11, chewed since I was 16, sometimes all at once. I have never experienced anything like this before.
--
====================================
GoosieMan: I have a twist of this that I keep in my cellar and it only gets broken out maybe once a every six weeks. One time I tried to smoke some pair with Scotch and I though my teeth were going to fall out. The last time I had a bowl, I packed it in my corncob for a New Year's hike. Big mistake. While walking and smoking I tend to accidentally inhale. I felt like I was going to ralph for about two hours after finishing that bowl.

ThaRuler57: That's awesome! Happened to me with  Fuente Anejo at a strip club! LMAO

====================================
chewsyourownadv: How fine of a cut can you get with your cigar cutter? I found that I prefer to use my sharpest filet knife and cut coins as thin as I can, rub it out and dry it, only using enough for 1/2 bowl at a time. That stuff is potent and damnably good.
--
chewsyourownadv: Oh, and if you want to optimize your system for the nicotine hit, you'll want something sweet like a soda. Have something sugary to eat/drink before and/or during smoking this stuff.
--
levins0: Lindt dark chocolate for the win!
--
TacticalBro: I'm big on /r/edc, bit the cigar cutter worked perfect. I used my knife to shred a little. 
--
levins0: That's what I do, with this and with brown Bogie. A good sharp knife is much better than a cigar cutter. The tobacco is too wet for a cutter. 
--
TacticalBro: I packed a bowl like it was the last I would ever smoke. Combination of shag and coins. My cigar cutter cuts the paper thin, the rope was a little moist for even my sharpest blade, I didn't want to stop the wrapper. 
--
====================================
burks21: I need to try this eventually. Sounds like an interestingly disgusting experience 
--
TacticalBro:  Asked for something obnoxious, foul and "like drinking  cold coffee grinds". 
Was not disappointed. 
--
fortheLOVEofBACON: This is one that I'll never try. I'm a lightweight when it comes to vitamin N and this is way out of my league. 
--
====================================
Savet: This is one of my everyday smokes.  It's one of my favorite tobaccos.
--
TacticalBro: *You* are a man not to be trifled with. 
--
Savet: I have a very high nicotine tolerance, which it's kept high by smoking things like 1792 flake, plugs, etc.  I normally have about the bowls a day when I get home from work.  One when I get home, then 2 after the wife and kid go to bed.

Unless I work from home.... I'm not admitting how many bowls I smoke in those days.
--
====================================
TacticalBro: This half section of rope was oily, moist and heavy as hell. Way heavier than any of my cigars, even Cohiba Gigante. 

It smelled of jerky and raisins and the smell of smoke on your shirt after a bonfire. Rubbing was not easy, "tearing" is probably a better description of what I did. A little coin goes a long way. 

I'll definitely be cellaring this tobacco, maybe a few grams kept ready for when I need to cowboy up.  http://i.imgur.com/9Et7HZ4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/CK1NCwO.jpg 
--
G_Peccary: I bought 4 oz years ago and haven't touched it since. Maybe it's time. 
--
TacticalBro: Make sure to have EMS standing by. 
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: Hahaha, yeah. Best consumed after a week or two of heavy smoking, and diretly after a big, beefy dinner. 
--
TacticalBro: I have a few Virginia and English blends, but hobbits weed is my daily smoke at night time. I smoke something light like skiff mixture or Sutliff Kazmir during the day.  
I'm going to need to bulk up on have your tobaccos Before I can touch that rope again
--
====================================
Arrogus: Sounds like a suitable replacement for the late Tambolaka.
--
TacticalBro: If Tambolaka is anything like this, it was probably fire cured in Hell over the decaying, bubbling bodies of the most damned. Then, *most likely*, dipped in the River of Blood and Bone and left to dry over a pit of  gaseous sulfur. 

Am I close?
--
Arrogus: Honestly tambo doesn't have a discernible smell pre-light, and tastes like pure bitterness when smoked. Experiencing it is more like a tribal initiation rite than anything else. 
--
====================================
mcguire: So, the effect is something like ... https://biblioklept.org/2016/12/18/sunday-comics-ï»¿-2/

(Unfortunately, I can't find the rest of the sequence, where Cerebus' body parts are trying to float off.)

====================================
givemeyours0ul: Dude. You got your ass kicked *by a plant*. You clearly weren't wearing your 511 operator pants. How can you be tactical without tactical pants, bro?
--
TacticalBro: You're right. I was in my long johns and smart robe.   There are my tac pants for today http://i.imgur.com/wHNbZOd.jpg 
--
givemeyours0ul: You are cleared to operate.
--
TacticalBro: Roger that, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!
--
====================================
mtn_mojo: Haha, this is awesome! I don't think I've tried the Irish X, only the Black XX, anyone know what the difference is between them? That rope kicks my ass, not sure I've ever gotten through a whole bowl. One of the few times I'll put sugar in my coffee is when I drink it along with this, since the sugar is supposed to help with the nic hit...not that it makes that much difference with how strong the tobacco is!
--
chewsyourownadv: Different ingredients and curing. Black Irish X is burley and Kentucky; Black XX is stoved Virginia.
--
mtn_mojo: Gotcha, looks like I should really just go on a rope rampage someday and get samples of all the SG / GH&Co offerings.
--
chewsyourownadv: Wait till you try Irish Brown X. It's *stronger* than Black X.
--
mtn_mojo: I've heard that, since the stoving of the virginias mellow out the nic levels a bit. I'm honestly not sure I can handle it, haha.
--
Savet: My understanding is that GH manufactured both ropes and just packages some for SG.  They should be essentially the same rope, possibly with different diameters.  Example, brown Irish x is same diameter as SG brown No. 4, but happy bogey is thinner.
--
None: I just don't believe it, the GH ropes are completely different texture and consistency than SG Black XX
--
Savet: I'll have to look up where I read that.  They may be different ropes, but I'm reasonably sure my memory of GH doing all of the manufacturing was correct.
--
TacticalBro: I got confused about that. Open tobacco reviews for each tobacco on separate pages. There seems to be a consensus that they're all different. 
--
====================================
misterzipp0: Dude! Mental *and* physical prep required!
--
TacticalBro: I can't imagine the mental prep for this. It was nuts
--
====================================
None: I don't find this blend to be overwhelming. It's a straight Virginia.
