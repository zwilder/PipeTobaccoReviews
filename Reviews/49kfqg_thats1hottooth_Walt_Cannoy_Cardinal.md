I recently received my Walt Cannoy Cardinal House Hollingsworth Large poker.

I, like others, received a discount of 30% in exchange for a completely honest and unbiased review. 

The bias may be hard to suppress, as I have wanted one of Walt's pipes for quite a while, but certainly cannot afford something like his gorgeous suedeblast pieces of art. I was stunned to see what he was doing with his Cardinal House line. but regardless, the bias is at least decreased by the fact that some lucky dog (ahem... /u/Scriptonic) got away with the Hollingsworth cutty-dog before I got to it. The Poker was the only one left.

This pipe retails for $269.

The pipe came in a stunning black box, carefully wrapped in bubble wrap, and had a gorgeous tan pipe sock included. The pipe, however was an even bigger surprise. Literally and figuratively.  This bowl on this sucker is ginormous.
It's not super wide, but I can put my index finger in there to my second knuckle. Whatever I smoke a bowl of in this pipe. I'd better want a lot of it. It's 2"-2.25" deep easily. 

The bowl being as huge as it is, along with the shorter shank and signature Walt Cannoy button on the stem. mean that this thing really isn't a clencher. It's a hanger if I really concentrate, but I'm not going to be chomping on this thing without support, even though the bamboo seems well reinforced. 

But I'll tell you, the button itself is a thing of beauty. You can tell Walt has put a lot of time and effort making his stems as thin and comfortable as possible. It shows.

Attention to detail is where this pipe seriously shines. The stain is fantastic, the curves are rounded well, the stamping is clear, and the bowl coating is even and perfectly done. What REALLY blew me away, however, was the detail in the transition between briar/bamboo, and Bamboo/stem. Seriously take a look at the photos. The butt joints are smooth when I run my finger over them, but on the bottom of the pipe, where the bamboo has some natural dips and fluctuations, the transitions in briar and stem are absolutely perfect.  Seamless. 

So far so great. but nature didn't do Walt many favors in this case. There are 4 very tiny pinprick sized pits in the briar, and 1 small pit cluster on the front of the pipe. 

Here's the thing. I probably would never have noticed, if my career didn't entail looking through a microscope day in and day out, and dealing with measurements in the tenths of millimeters. 

But nature is nature. and these pits are teeny tiny. and they are hidden so damn well, that if I hadn't consciously turned this pipe around under a bright light looking specifically at the areas of reflection, I would have
never seen them. They are hidden so incredibly well by the stain and overall finish. 

In my line of work Attention to every single detail is everything. And it seems Walt made the best of what nature gave him and one-upped it with the beautiful work on the stem and shank. 

As for how it smokes. I've put 3 half-bowls of Lane Ready-rubbed through it, and am completely thrilled so far. The drilling is absolutely immaculate, and the airway is smooth, open, and completely free of turbulence. Despite the fact that I tend to puff rather quickly, I got zero gurgle.  

All but 3 of my pipes, including this one, are estate pipes. I don't have the money to spend on new or handmade pipes. In fact, even with the discount, this is the most I have ever spent on a pipe. I had to sell some stuff to get it, too. It's hard to imagine spending this much for me. but I have no regrets in this case at all. If I were to spend $200-300 for a pipe in the future, I have a feeling I'd be checking out what Walt has in stock first. I feel very fortunate to own this pipe, and certainly hope to own another in the future. I might even get a suedeblast if I win the lottery.
