PREAMBLE: Thanks to u/linearone and u/coldsolderjoint for letting me in on the experience. I waited a few days for the heat wave and smoke to clear, but since that apparently isn't going to happen any time soon, I decided to hell with it and had a bowl. Here's my review. 

TIN NOTE: Delicious. Very sweet like its components, but there was a strong fermented note that surprised me (more on that later). The family always wants to smell any new tobacco I get and they were universally impressed. My youngest said it smelled like cinnamon raisin bread. Better than "corrosive crouton" I suppose.

SOUNDTRACK: Zappa, of course! Did I ever tell you about that time I accidentally drove Ike Willis to buy crack? No? Nevermind. Everyone in Portland has a story like that.

WEAPON OF CHOICE: A stout James Upshall that I mostly use for aros.

LIQUID ACCOMPANIMENT: Iced latte with extra shots. It's hot out, man!

FACIAL HAIR MODE: Mutton chops as of yesterday. I've had a full beard for years and years now but... it's hot out, man!

THE ACTUAL REVIEW, ALREADY, WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY FOR YOUR SHENANIGANS: Was still moist and sticky after a short drying period but still lit easily and stayed lit. The first bit was of course the most aromatic, and absolutely tasted like a sweet starchy breakfast. I didn't get much of a cinnamon note to it but then again I've never gotten much of one from PS Cinnamon anyway (it's a great blender, though). Mid bowl it got a maltier, buttered-toast-that-almost-burnt flavor. Towards the end of the bowl it began tasting ashy and bitter but by this time I was rushing the smoke in an effort to go inside. Like I said, it's hot out, man.

SUMMARY: The phrase that keeps coming to me is "elevated codger". That's a good thing, as I love traditional aros as much as I like fancy Neoanglican blends with a load of dry-hopped Latakia. PTM is definitely on the sweet side with a stout burley flavor. However, that fermented smell I mentioned? It's present in the smoking as well, giving the sort of cider vinegar note that I normally associate with a VaPer. This extra dimension is what elevates it. 

JESUS WEPT, HE'S STILL GOING: I appreciate the sample, but I also appreciate this idea that people on the sub are experimenting with their own blends, sharing recipes and knowledge. It's great, and glad I can be part of it.  

====================================
linearone: Excellent review! Thanks for being a part of history! We are very proud of this and, we are considering having it made by a real company that can actually sell it (shhh don't tell anybody).

Jigokubosatsu: UPDATE: I just remembered there is perique in the blend. So I guess that means I'm an idiot but my sniffer still works.

jdcasiglia: How do I get this?

Jigokubosatsu: I won't speak for sample availability, but at the very least there is a thread on here where they share the PTM recipe. You can make it yourself!
