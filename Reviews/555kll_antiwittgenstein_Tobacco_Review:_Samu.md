Review # 78

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith’s Navy Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** Samuel Gawith's Navy Flake is a traditional offering of Virginias, pressed with a small amount of Latakia for complexity and flavored with a dash of Rum. Medium to full in strength.

**Leaf:** Rather long coarse dark flakes with a few white veins
 
**Tin Aroma:** Hay and earth

**Taste:** Very light at the beginning. Hay. The lightest citrus-vinegar touch. A whisper of sweetness.  Something fruity, cherry I think. And just a little sliver of candle wax. The smoke volume is rather sparse, whispy pulls that disappear quickly into the night, but everything seems watered down, or even distant, viewing the tastes from across the parking lot, waving a quick, awkward hello. It stays like this until it seems like somewhere about a quarter or third into the bowl I hit a nice dense chunk and the flavors really come into view. And they are not good.

It gets sweeter, the vinegar comes up, but the vague cherry pushes to the front, and with it a boozy, like vodka boozy, taste comes on. It tastes like cheap cherry flavored brandy. Or actually, dear god, it tastes exactly like cherry [Chloraseptic]( http://www.chloraseptic.com/). I try smoking past it, hoping for some relief, but the only relief is the smooth alcoholic numbing of my throat in Pavlovian response to the taste. I am done and scrap out the bowl. I had basically hit dottle anyway.

**Nicotine:** Pretty mild, especially by SG standars 2-3, and that is with dinner hours ago.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie


**Smokability:** Dried this aggressively but it still had a hard time getting going, and relights were numerous.
 
**Room Note:** Smoked outside. Not hopeful.

**Thoughts:** At first I was a bit disappointed with this blend. It was all hay and light and not much going on. This disappointment stemmed from how much like some of the other Samuel Gawith products. But when I really got to know this tobacco I realized it was not just disappointing, it was bad. Not objectively bad, I don’t really see how other people might like this stuff, though it is not like say, a Lakeland that made me want to burn all my pipes.

I don’t usually do this, but I wanted to know if my experience was in any way typical. The reviews on the P&C, smokingpipes, and TR are almost, but not quite universally positive. Several reviewers complain that it is very plain. A couple mentioned that occasionally there will be a bowl that tastes rotten, weird or off. Some of these gave up after a bad smoked. Some smoked on and said they had plenty of good to great smokes from this stuff, that it is merely inconsistent, with a small chance of a truly horrid smoke.

I am not going to smoke this again. I have too many other tobaccos, both known to be excellent – every time without fear of influenza fever flashbacks – or, and always more enticing, so many unopened jars and tins beckoning me on. 
 
**Similar Tobaccos:**Um, thankfully, none. Similar in style and presentation to Full Virginia Flake, Summer Flake, St. James Flake, but thankfully none of those taste like medicine.
 
**Summary:** A plain Virginia flake with a unique Cherry flavored medicine topping.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2.5 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**- - -

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (The Monster Mash)
====================================
erkpikII: Never got cherry myself. I get savory with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. Think kettle corn popcorn thats more salt than sweet.

====================================
crimblade: Ha! I always wondered how much you'd stick to reviewing a blend you really didn't like. 

On a side note I just tried SG fire dance this weekend and was rather impressed at how well it took my illusions on what it meant to be an aro and shoved them off a cliff. 
--
antiwittgenstein: I don't have that much patience for bad tobacco. I can live with meh tobacco, lackluster, or boring, but once I get an off flavor I don't want to risk it again.

That Firedance is indeed a revelation. It is the aromatic we were always promised, in myths, legends, and song, realized in corporeal form.

boomer56: Thank you for another interesting review, and in this case a most welcome one given how frequently I have prevaricated over getting a tin of SGNF. I seem to have chosen wisely, more by luck than judgement.

It's always nice to see the A-Witt byline on a review! More please!

antiwittgenstein: Thanks! It might always be this bad, but it has a tendency towards plainness. If you want to try it anyway, PM me your addy and I can mail you a sample.

====================================
givemeyours0ul: I know you usually smoke multiple bowls, I take it in this case you did not? I've smelled a chloraseptic aroma wafting from tins before, never nailed down what it was coming from. Have yet to taste it.
--
antiwittgenstein: This was my third bowl of the stuff. The other two weren't like this, just very plain. As soon as I hit that cherry I knew I was done with this blend and had to write it up.

====================================
Dsreven: meh, i dont see why they call it a navy flake when it has latakia in it, its like calling OGS or deluxe navy rolls a straight virginia, all a navy flake should have is virginia, burley, and rum or just virginia and rum
