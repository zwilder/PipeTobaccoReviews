PipeBeard: Tl;dr My all time favorite. Four stars.

This is my "goldilocks" in that it checks off so many of my "just right" categories. Just the right amount of VA sweetness, just the right body, just the right strength. Perfect mouthfeel, mild and cool, just a touch creamy. To me, this is about as good as Virginia flakes get. Yes, it's moist as hell out of the tin, yes it can be fussy, but it's worth it. This one forces you to smoke it low and slow. I like to take slow sips and just let the smoke spill out, and it gives that brown, earthy, hay like VA goodness. I love FVF, and I find that I have to work just a bit harder to find the magic in this one, but it forces me to slow down and enjoy it. I tend to buy it by the pound.

antiwittgenstein: Does this have any citrus or vinegar to it, or all on the earthy side?
--
PipeBeard: There's a bit of ketchup in the tin note, but the flavor is all earthy for me.

crimblade: **Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith Best Brown Flake

**Description on Tin:** A firm favourite for the pipe smoker looking for a medium strength, gentle and slow burning tobacco. Manufactured using hand-stripped flue cured Virginias with no flavours added, Best Brown will reward with a cool, sweet smoke with a delectable aroma and good sidestream. Mild to medium.

**Leaf:** Flake. They remind me of strips of jerky, or perhaps leather. Sugar crystals spot their surface.

**Tin Aroma:** Sweet, relaxing, reminds me of hay, or perhaps the smell of fallen leaves in autumn.

**Taste:** Tangy, it reminded me of oatmeal, or perhaps a lightly roasted malt grain. Occasionally there would be an increase in sweetness which would go just as quickly as it came. Earthy is an appropriate term, again it reminds me of the smell of the air in autumn, the dirt and slowly rotting vegetation, that unmistakable scent of plant life. No citrus to speak of which I very much enjoyed as it would have only distracted. Surprising burn on the retrohale, I didn't do that much after the first two. This tobacco impressed me in how simple it was. To create something good there has to be no mistakes, with complexity it's easy to hide the mistakes in the myriad of flavors, not so simplicity.

**Smokability:** I rubbed it out after drying for 30 minutes the first time I smoked it, it was very resistant to lighting. However once lit it burned very well and a lot longer than I expected. No tongue bite or gurgle at all. The next time I smoked it I folded and stuffed after an hour of drying. It was a perfect fold and stuff, but lighting was anything but. Again once I finally got it lit it burned well and needed very few relights but getting that initial light was an achievement in itself. 

**Room Note:** Hard to detect with smoking outside, what I did get was very pleasant.

**Thoughts:** It's easy to see why this is considered a staple for many pipe smokers. Despite my frustration with lighting it was an extremely enjoyable smoke without being overbearing. I very much enjoyed the longer smoking sessions it lends itself to. This was the first tobacco I've had that had crystals on it, which was very exciting to get them out of the tin with that amount of age already on them.

**Recommend to:** Anyone looking for a simple smoke that is more than one dimensional. For what it's worth it paired very well with a cream ale.

**Summary:** I don't know if I'll buy another tin of this when it's out, but I'm certainly going to enjoy working through the remainder as I alternate between what I have in jars. That being said I'm rather intrigued to what it would be like with a multitude of years on it so maybe I'll grab a couple and forget about them for a time.

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for a year and a half with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Mortons Cellar, White Knight, and Escudo Navy Deluxe. 

**Rating:** 3/4

mk_bway: **Review #2: Samuel Gawith - Best Brown Flake**

Yay, another community review! While I'm still experimenting with different tobacco blends and learning what each has to offer, the subject of this review interested me for one reason. That reason is simply that there is only one tobacco in it: Virginia. I like the idea of isolating a tobacco and saw this review as an opportunity to get acquainted with the aromas and flavors specifically associated with just plain old Virginia tobacco.

* **Tin Aroma:** The first thing I think of after cracking the tin is bread. It makes me think of the dough and yeast before bread is cooked, but I haven't actually smelled that in some time so perhaps I am mis-remembering that smell. Delving a little deeper into the aroma I pick up a sort of old barn smell, there is definitely some hay scent in there. It actually smells pretty good.

* **Leaf:**  Best Brown Flake is cut into nice flakes. I'm not sure if they're considered thick, they seem kind of thick to me. "The tobacco is mostly brown," declared Capt. Obvious. However, there are also some lighter streaks and swirls running through the flake. As is common with SG tobaccos, mine displayed a bit of plume. This kind of made me nervous at first, but thankfully I was able to run a quick search in this sub to calm my nerves. Again as others have mentioned, it's fairly moist. So crack the tin and find something else to do while it dries out.

* **Taste:** As others have said, this smoke is very earthy. I get a little bit of tang and some dark fruit sweetness, but it is mostly an earthy flavor with a persistent hint of hay. It's quite smooth and even creamy. No indication of casing.

* **Room Note:** I didn't get much feedback from the wife on this one. If I recall, it was simply, "That stinks." 

* **Strength:** It's a pretty mellow tobacco, but there is some nicotine spice to be enjoyed.

* **Overall:** I've enjoyed the time I've spent with this tobacco so far. I'll definitely finish off the tin as all the bowls I've had to this point have been rubbed out. I still have to try the fold and stuff method. It's the kind of tobacco I like putting in a cob and smoking while sitting around watching the sunset. Actually, in my case, it's just watching the sky get dark as my backyard faces East.

* **Rating: 3/4 Worth Trying**

None: My review of SG BBF:

This is a good tobacco. Smoke this tobacco.

End review.

None: That's all the motivation I needed to open another tin.

crimsonrat: I'll give this 3 stars. My taste is a little off at the moment but I still enjoyed it. I actually smoked it straight out of the tin, which is strange for an SG blend. 

/u/PipeBeard describes it right: really earthy; I get a subtle sweetness, no real spice or bite to it. Really good blend, and I'd recommend grabbing a could of tins to put back for age. Good blend that may be great with time.
