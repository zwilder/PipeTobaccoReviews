[Review] C&D - Bayou Morning Flake
By: crimblade
---
**Blend Name:** C&D Bayou Morning Flake

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** A Virginia/Perique lover's delight! We start with Old Belt Red Virginias, add 25% Perique and press the whole before slicing into flakes.

**Leaf:** Virginia and Perique. Dark brown broken flake with the occasional spec of lightness.

**Tin Aroma:** Wonderful dark fruit with an underlying tangy spice. 

**Taste:** Lovely spicey pepper from the perique. Dark stone fruit is without a doubt the backbone of that spice. A nice sweetness from the Virginians. There might be the occasional hay note but the spicey dark fruit is the main showing in this smoke.

**Smokability:** Moisture level is spot on for me right out of the tin. The broken flakes rub out rather easily, I've not smoked this any other way than rubbed out. The smoke itself is cool and you'd be hard pressed to scorch your tongue on it. It's got a hearty nicotine punch that builds very slowly. Relights are few and in between.

**Room Note:** Pretty much in line with most Va/Per room notes. Nothing to write home about but not off putting.

**Thoughts:** I've been a little leary of Perique heavy blends since I've been having a contentious relationship with Fire Storm (It's good, I just don't understand how perique can ghost a cob). Anyways I'm glad I picked this one up. I actually debated for a long time between getting the ready rubbed and the flake version, I ended up going with the flake because I enjoy the presentation and preparation. I'm actually curious as to how it actually differs from the ready rub. The fruity spice of the blend is a really good complement to coffee on the patio in the morning. My recommendation if you do so is to make sure you have ample morning time to sit in quiet contemplation as it has a nice Nicotine wallop that is fairly unexpected when you stand up. Despite the fact that it's advertised as a "morning" blend I found that it is very good for an evening of relaxation as well. It does leave an interesting after taste with you for sometime which can be less than desirable at times.

**Recommend to:** Anyone looking for a Va/Per that gives a bit more lead to the Perique. If you enjoy Firestorm you'll probably enjoy this one. Anyone looking for a blend that pushes the dark fruity flavors of the perique and the spice at the same time.

**Summary:** It's a delicious blend, a really nice change up on the average Va/Per blend that's out there. I have another tin in the cellar but will probably pick up more in order to put some age on it and see what balance that brings.

**Drink Pairings:**  Coffee, black Tea, Lemonade was the bees knees.

**Final Rating:** 3.5/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
briarconsequences: Thanks for the review!  Bayou Morning (ready-rubbed) is my every day smoke, so I had to try the flake. It's a bit different, and I had some trouble with it until I learned about cube cutting.  Once I had that methodology perfected I find it a little bit more flavorful than the ready-rubbed, and it's a longer smoke.

professor_throway: Nice review!

This one had always scared me a bit. I like perique, but there is an upper limit on the amount I can take before retrohaling feels like a horseradish sinus rinse. I personally find Fire Storm completely over the top and largely unsmokable. I think I will have to give this a pass.

crimblade: It's not quite up to the punch in the face that is firestorm but it's definitely got the perique spice up front. Right now I'm hoping Firestorm will mellow some with a little age on it, or at least balance out better than just screaming "YOU WANT SOME PEPPER!!" at me when I smoke it.

PrkChpLvr: Great Review! I have a tin in the cellar that I need to crack. I'm a big fan of Beacon Extra and the bulk Bayou Morning.

crimblade: I have a tin of Beacon Extra in my cellar that I'll crack at some point, how does it compare to the bulk Bayou Morning? I say this of course not really knowing how the bulk BM tastes but assuming it's in the same neighborhood as the flake.

PrkChpLvr: I think it's much more intense tasting—especially the perique—than Bayou Morning. The main difference, for me, is that Bayou Morning is brighter tasting, maybe crisper. Beacon Extra is rich and tangy ... definitely more oomph. I'm finishing off the last few bowls of my B.E. tin and leaving it to dry out has done wonders for the flavor. I understand why folks open McCelland tins and leave them sitting out. It makes a world of difference.
