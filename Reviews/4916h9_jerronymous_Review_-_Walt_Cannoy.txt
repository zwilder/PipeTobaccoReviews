Review - Walt Cannoy Langford Balldog Nosewarmer, First Impressions

Walt Cannoy is an American pipe carver that has been making pipes since 1999. A rather more extensive bio is available at [pipedia.org] (https://pipedia.org/wiki/Cannoy).

Model Reviewed: [Langford Balldog Nosewarmer] (http://waltcannoy.com/the-langford-series/). Retail price is $249.00 US. I paid 30% less in exchange for an unbiased review, so I'll evaluate based on the retail price as best I can.

I just posted images here:

The pics don't really do justice to the 2-tone contrast finish and graining throughout, but there are better pics on http://waltcannoy.com. It's really striking, and the shaping is superb. It's also the only Bulldog-ish pipe in my collection with no bead line, which makes me pretty happy. The division between the lower and upper halves of the bowl is achieved with a dark stain, rather like the Italian "fumed" style top. It works well with the overall contrast theme, I think.

The overall craftsmanship is rather spot on. The drilling is straight and right to the bottom of the chamber. It's also got a wide-open draw, as advertised. The acrylic stem tapers to almost an edge at the bit, with a hole just narrow enough to fit a bristle pipe cleaner, but this doesn't seem to inhibit the draw in any substantial way. Needless to say, a pipe cleaner runs through to the bottom of the chamber with no twisting or cajoling.

This baby weighs in at 50 grams, or 1.7 oz, after conversion (Walt is one of those pipemakers who lists pipe dimensions in U.S. units but their weights in metric, for reasons I have yet to fathom), but it's under-five-inch length keeps is just clenchable. The lack of a dental bit or, better yet, saddle bit, keeps it from being a great clencher, but I can hold it in my teeth for short periods, anyway.

Just about the only thing I can ding the pipe on is the presence of an edge where the shank meets the stem. Running a finger along the surface of the shank, I can feel where it reaches the stem, just a bit, where normally these would be flush with one another. But that's it, really.

I plan on posting a fuller review later on, as I have only had this pipe for about 24 hours now, and I've found a pipe only shows its true colors over time. It has a bowl coating, so building cake shouldn't be a problem, but I'm not going to make any pronouncements there. So far, this little thing smokes quite dry for a new pipe, so it has that going for it. It doesn't deliver terribly cool smoke, but my opinion on that may change as I begin to smoke tobaccos in it besides the Semois I normally use for break-in purposes.

Recommend? I can't say yet. But it certainly looks like a promising piece of briar. Back in a couple of weeks with a follow-up.

joshoowah: Thanks for the review. I got one of his pipes as gift for IPSD, so I'll have to try it out once I see it.

jerronymous: Thanks, buddy! I brought it down to Mexico for a more strenuous test. Everything is smoking wet here because of the 200% humidity, so it'll be interesting to see how it goes.
