First review / St. James Woods By McClelland
By: JakeJones
---
Blend Name: St. James Woods 

Description on Tin: A highly sophisticated broken Flake of matured Red and Black stoved Virginias pressed with the finest Louisiana Perique. This beautiful, mottled tobacco has an especially deep, rich character with that mysterious and compelling aroma that is Perique's alone. A truly satisfying delight for natural Virginia pipe tobacco.

Leaf: Broken Flake

Tin Aroma: Okay, This is what has pushed me to review it in the first place. I have never experienced an aroma as when i opened this tin...

Some sort of DARK and RICH fruits. Maybe a fig? Many figs? A few dates perhaps. This was so incredibly compelling It is why i am writing this right now. 5/5 

Taste: Sweet / light / spicy.  A positive experience. FIVE OUT OF FIVE. 

Smokability: Absolutely. It was so smokable that i smoked the whole bowl. 

Room Note: Fruits. Happiness. 

Thoughts. I lucked out. When i went to Pipesandcigars (B&M) Their collection was skimpy. I found this tin... aged since 2015. I am sure this had something to do with the rich aroma. I ordered a whole ton on P&C and Smoking pipes for the cellar. 

Recommend to: VaPer enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts alike.

Summary: I am a happy man. Max Score.  Happy IPSD, Everyone go find a tin aged at least a year. Have fun :)  


My Background: Smoking pipes since 2012. My world came alive in 2013 when i found frog morton (goodbye random bulk B&M blends, Hello world of tins.) My second awakening was joining /r/pipetobacco. Since, my cellar and pipe collection has gone off the books... FDA will never catch me. May their policies be firmly struck down.

elsw00d: My thoughts exactly on this blend. For me it's tied for #1 with Cabbie's Mixture. I'm stocking up on it as well. I just wish I could order it in large quantities like you guys in the states!

UtterArc: I love this blend so much. The very first time I smoked it I knew it was going to be my tobacco wife. If you are a perique person then this is a blend to try.  Often.

Mikey86: I just bought a tin online. Thanks for the review - this sounds right up my alley. I'm trying a few new-to-me Va/Pers. I fell in love with Dunhill Dark Flake a couple of months before they announced they are shutting down : / This sounds like a similar flavor profile.

anxst: Nice review. I've not had this blend, but your review really makes me want to give it a try. Happy IPSD!

CaptainDickPuncher: I like St james Woods but sometimes it comes across as just a bit too syrupy sweet for my taste. It's a great VaPer but it can be a bit dessert like for me to enjoy frequently.
