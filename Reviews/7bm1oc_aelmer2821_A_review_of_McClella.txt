So once again, dear readers, I am here at the subjugation of /u/antiwittgenstein, to delve into yet another review. Today, at the request of the good users of this sub, I will be reviewing McClelland's 221 B Black Shag, with the reminder that I am not the best reviewer, so bear that in mind.

To call a tobacco something with a historical literary root is a bold statement. We should also bear in mind a couple of facts about Tobacco in Victorian England: 
* 1: Tobacco was vital to the day to day of the people of this time. It was without a doubt the most socially- as well as class- driven past time of the era. 
* 2: The type of tobacco was a definition of of stature. The format of delivery was also related to the social interaction taking place. 

To clarify, Holmes himself was an addict. Nicotine was his preferred drug, and he took it as many ways as he could: At times, he would have a Cigar with Watson over drinks. He once used a cigarette to find a hidden door (dropping the ash onto the floor to see if it got disturbed). He had a snuff box he kept in the study. But of all the methods he used in the books to get his dose of Vitamin N, his clay pipe and his Persian slipper of Black Shag were the most famous. Now, lets take a moment to discuss the idea of the Black Shag. 

The Black Shag was most likely a common loose tobacco that anyone could get from a street vendor. Shag cuts were typically the cheapest you could get, and could be rolled in a cigarette, stuffed in a hookah, or packed in a pipe. Remember, tobacco was a dictation of your social status at the time, Doyle was pointing out to us at that time that Holmes was a member and respected amongst the higher echelons of society, but was most likely frugal, wanting the most bang for his buck.  He didn't treat this tobacco with respect either. It was dry, roughly packed and smoked hot. Indeed, many times in the process of an investigation he would be pacing just puffing away, only stopping to shake out the Dottle so he could dry it for later use. 

Why the Literature lesson? To set the stage for this tobacco named for the famous, if slightly inexpensive Shag. At an ideal moisture, this is a soft, finely cut tobacco. The tin note is pungent, I saw it compared to "Korean Teriyaki Pork" in a review on P&C, which I don't feel does it justice. Its a fired Straight Virginia, which caught me unawares. I would have called it an English, as it has notes of Latakia and Orientals, without actually *having* either leaf. 

Black Shag packs well. Its a small cut tobacco, and you can gravity fill or 3 tamp pack which ever works for you. It lights easy enough as well. Light char followed by a smooth lighting draw and you are good to go.
*1st 1/3: Tangy and sweet, burns cool, and taste reminds me of a good scotch; smokey and oaky. There is a tingle in the back of your mouth, and there is that sour tang I get from orientals.
*2nd 1/3: Really, since I have been mostly a VaPer smoker these last few months, I was expecting a flavor change, or an intensity change. I get neither of these, just more of the tang of sour. 
*Last 1/3: So again, no real shift in flavor, but Nicotine punch in full effect, as said in a movie: "Makes you wanna reach out and slap yo momma." But in this instance, you are the momma. The easiest way I can equate it is that one minute you are fine, puffing along, thinking of whatever you are deducing, the next, you hear the power hum of the Death Star charging up and you realize you have slipped into a nicotine induced catharsis. Now, what catches you off guard about this is that its like you are still at the top of the bowl taste wise, but you can tell by the light fluffy ash that you are not.

Downside to this tobacco is that even with drying, its a moist smoke. So keep your pipe cleaners close by, within a few puffs after the smoking light you will surely gurgle. 

Overall Rating: 3.5/5. Its unique, with a good consistent flavor and a healthy dose of Vitamin N; but it burns damp, and its more a novelty smoke for me than my daily go to. 

TL;DR: Not Bad, but not a daily. 
Thanks again Readers, til next time, It's Elementary.

mugwump867: This one is a nic hit for sure.  The fact that it's a shag cut also encourages you to smoke it faster than you usually would a pipe tobacco which doesn't help any.
