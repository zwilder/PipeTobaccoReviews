First, I would like to re-iterate how awesome East India Officer's Club is.  I have gone back to this blend more often than any of the other smokes from the mail call. I may switch it up with Cult Blood Red as the aromatic in my rotation to keep me from getting burned out on either.   
  
On to the new things..  
  
* **Quick Hits**  
  
C'est La Vie French Vanilla Pouch: an even smoke but no trace of vanilla, the Drexel pouch was a better vanilla smoke  
   
John Bull Pouch: its English in a Pouch, good smoke, but Peterson Wild Atlantic is better    
  
  
* **Orlik Mellow Mixture**  
  
Ad Copy: *Mellow Mixture combines wonderful bright Virginias with two distinctly different black Cavendishes and a touch of toasted Burley. The unique chocolate and caramel topping adds an enjoyable aroma, and just enough sweetness to be noticeable but not dominant.*  
  
This isn't a bad smoke and it is indeed mellow. However, it had a sourness to it as well. I didn't enjoy the tin note, room note, or flavor and reading the reviews it seems like quite a few people agree.  Maybe the flavors just don't agree with my palate, but that sour funk was a real show stopper.  
  
Luckily, the tin was an upsell offer from P&C so I didn't shell out much for it. Here is the real benchmark, **"is this tin better than Captain Black White as a mellow aromatic?". No.**  
  
You don't want to pay a tin price for something that doesn't beat Lane's drug store label.  
  
  
* **Hearth & Home Marquee WhiteKnight**  
 
**I aborted the first bowl of this I tried**. I'm not sure if it was the time of day or if the tobacco needed to off-gas from being tinned or what, but I had a quick unpleasant aborted smoke.  
  
Fast forward to this afternoon at my favorite smoking lounge. I kicked back with White Knight and a diet Root beer.  
  
It was **incensual**.  The incense-like flavor and room note were amazing.  
  
In writing this I had to go re-read Russ's notes on it:  
  
> When I released Hearth & Home Marquee WhiteKnight, the customer feedback was very positive, so I feel that the effort was worth it. WhiteKnight utilizes the same types of tobaccos that went into B.S.O.S.M. - bright Virginias, magnificent Orientals, especially the "Queen of Tobaccos", Yenidje, and rich, smoky Latakia. There's an incense-like aroma to WhiteKnight that immediately recalls my old favorite, and there's a crispness to the flavor that's unlike most Latakia blends. It also has a short, clean finish that makes it a good choice to pair up with your favorite beverage.

I had it with a diet root beer and it was good with that. I'm not sure that was the beverage he had in mind. It really turned some heads in the smoking lounge due to the room note. **It self-advertises**. As he said in his note, it is indeed crisp and has a clean finish. I went right from this to more Officer's Club and didn't have Latakia aftertaste dominating that second smoke.  
  
I am not a huge orientals guy. I'm an English/lite-English/aromatic guy. However, White Knight will remain in my stash for when I get a craving for that rich incensual experience.  
  
**White Knight isn't smoked, it is experienced. I think that says much.**   
  
TL;DR:  
Officer's Club: still awesome, like warm soft boobs in your face  
C'est La Vie: Vanilla? Non! Non!  
John Bull: good, but doesn't escape the shadow of Wild Atlantic as the pouch English default  
Orlik Mellow: back to the drawing board, or stop letting the interns mix the dressing  
WhiteKnight: permanently staying in my chest of smokes, oriental sex magic  
====================================
Matsutake_slayer: "WhiteKnight:... oriental sex magic"

That's really all that needed saying.

givemeyours0ul: I need to get this warm boob Tobacco. Honestly I ignored everything by that "blender" due to the K. Hansotia name on it. I like Gurkhas well enough, especially the big cheap packs on CI, but they make WAAAAY too many blends, and it shows. Big fancy labels, mediocre-okay sticks. I expected the same from the pipe tobacco line. Based on your review I'll give it a shot.

Fuzzy_Totemz: I believe that the pipe tobacco is blended by P&C but I could be wrong. P&C is the distributor and it is my impression that the brand name is just part of a license deal.  
  
Someone can feel free to correct me.

givemeyours0ul: I'm almost 100% sure you are right, as I'm sure that also applies to most cigars released with that name on them.

ChefJohnboy: Owner of my local shop had some Fusiliers Ration that I loved. If I could log onto PC I would totally order that and a bunch of others (White Knight included!)

I was really impressed with Fusiliers Ration... Hoping White Knight will impress me too

givemeyours0ul: If you like FR, get the new Bengal Slices also. Russ blended both as attempts at recreating the original Bengal Slices, FR from memory and new Bengal from memory, samples and scientific analysis of the original. I find they smell the same but the tin note is more strongly found in the smoke of Bengal. I love the new Bengal, I've got about 15 tins.
