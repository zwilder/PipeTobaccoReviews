Powdered Toast Man Review

1st and 2nd smokes were in a Missouri Meeschaum Morgan (well broken in). 3rd was in a Missouri Meerschaum Tom Sawyer (new).

I wanted to give this tobacco a true chance, so I took notes the first and second smokes, and made sure I had a few days in-between to account for mood and palate differences. The 3rd smoke was completely casual after a good meal.

Aroma: Buttery and sweet, like caramel, and maybe some vanilla. Rich.

The charring light is wholesome and buttery. The smoke is smooth and creamy, and definitely buttery in flavor. Cinnamon starts to trade off with the butter, and the sweetness of what I thought to be toasted burley in the retrohale. The buttery flavor mellows and mingles with the cinnamon by the end of the first third of the bowl, and the burley makes me happy. In fact, through each of the three bowls I smoked, the burley was unmistakable, and I loved it because it works so well with the buttery flavor. The cinnamon lightens up and then jumps in again towards the end of the bowl, and all the while melds with the burley nicely, too. What is interesting to me is, the burley mixes well with the cinnamon and butter components individually, but the cinnamon and butter tend to maintain their separate flavors, so the burley is the diplomat. I was surprised to learn there was perique in the blend. I didn't pick up on it save for a hint of spiciness that quickly diminished at the end of the second bowl.

The smoke stayed remarkably cool and dry, and wonderfully flavorful. The burn remained nice and even, and the bowl was smoked on each occasion down to a fine, light grey ash with nothing left. 
I could easily make this an all day smoke. It's great after a hearty meal, too.

My thanks to u/coldsolderjoint and u/linearone for this delightful and fun experiment, and especially for sharing the recipe. Kudos, fellas.
