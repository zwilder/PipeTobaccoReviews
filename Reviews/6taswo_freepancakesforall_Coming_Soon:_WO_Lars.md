Coming Soon: WO Larsen Hand Pressed Review!
By: freepancakesforall

====================================
freepancakesforall: Big thank you to /u/Jaxx666 for this tiny sample of the notorious WO Larsen Limited Edition Hand Pressed tobacco. For those of you not in the know, this blend retails at (a highly mocked and contested) $1,000 per 3.5 oz brick, making it one of the most expensive blends in the world. Is it worth the price tag? We're going to find out!    

Unfortunately, it's a touch on the dry side so we're currently do a slow, indirect re-hydration with the towel over the bowl method. Review coming as soon as it's ready.

givemeyours0ul: Did u/jaxxx666 actually buy it!?!? 
--
freepancakesforall: I think he received this sample and wasn't an aromatic fan. Or he's a baller.
--
Raine342: I'm going with, "he's a baller".
--
Jaxx666: A buddy of mine got it as a sample in Denmark. I traded him a pipe for it but then never felt quite right about smoking it. 
--
====================================
Barimore: Just curious about what causes such a high price tag.  Rare components?
--
phonkubot: They shoot the blender after they're done and burn the recipe on a bed of dodo feathers.
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Nothing really. It's just a limited batch hand made by the blender and not delegated to the factory to make.  
   
It's a conspicuous consumption item.  
  
It's a Danish Aromatic (which isn't a popular category in America) with added floral essence (gale extract).  
  
The smoke isn't worth 1000  dollars, but for a Dubai smoker it would be a like owning a Bugatti car. 
--
Mythodiir: Yeah. Like million dollar bottles of vodka. It's for rich cunts with more money than sense.
--
Barimore: interesting, thanks for the info. 
--
====================================
feernot: Did we ever get this review?!
--
freepancakesforall: Haha, not yet! Had to do a bit of rehydrating. Then work called. Then the flue. Just started feeling better this week. This one will be next! (Totally forgot about it)
--
feernot: Did you even get to try it yet?
--
freepancakesforall: Nope. The sample is still sealed and unsmoked.     

Going to smoke some Larsen Craftman tonight to get my tastebuds ready.
