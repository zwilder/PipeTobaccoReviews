So... this tobacco review is the sole reason I purchased Early Morning Pipe.

I was looking to try some popular blends when I stumbled across this review of Dunhill's Early Morning Pipe. Posted by tmoney on tobaccoreviews.com. I immediately purchased a tin online without question. I have not yet tried the EMP, but this review has forever changed my life.

This tobacco was good so good, that it reminded me of a time long ago....

Place, Vietnam. The Year is 1965. The Month, June. Day: The 7th; AKA Day 282 in 'Nam for me. June was the rainy season for 'Nam. I had been given some leave time from my base in Saigon and so I went to explore the City, like usual, my buddies didnt get leave, but I hoped to find some more GI's in some of the local bars. It was unseasonably dry that day. No rain. It was nice for once to not deal with dagum water in the shoes. I felt good, like it was going to be a swell day; I had every reason to think so. A week before, I had killed 10 Charlie in one night. I was satisfied. And now I had leave, who could ask for anything more?

I stopped in at a bar in the East Side of Saigon called Do Phing Pan Ngo, where all the action was. The bar was bustling with GI's. Different guys trying to sweep some exotic doll off of her feet and into the bed. I had similar plans. I walked to the bar and ordered myself a tall one, ready to relax and find a target. Then it happened. She walked in lookin like something out of a dream. So gorgeous, she was with her sexy Vietnamese hips and supple behind. I knew what had to be done. I ordered another beer, and started over to her. Just before I did, some officer cut in front of me. Dam. He had beat me to the punch. I was just a lowly grunt. There was nothing that I could do. The babe started shooting me looks as the Officer was talkin her up. I knew this would be my only chance to get laid until i was sent back into the jungles to fight charlie. Charlie would always be there. This doll wouldnt. I made my move. As I did it, I felt my balls grow 3 times larger. A grunt was about to steal a woman from Officer. I approached her; didnt say a word and just took her hand and left with her, leaving the officer to shove it. I led her off to a small hotel room where we made love with out even speaking. We made love many times before the morning of the next day came, i wish I could remember the number, but I lost track after 30. I would have set a company record.

As she is there sleeping I got up to watch the sun rise over beautiful Saigon, with a gentle mist sweeping the rooftops that morning and I smoked a fat stogie in honor of my recent accomplishments. It was the most incredible feeling in the world, despite my man tool nearly falling off. The beautiful woman was still asleep after having the night of her life. I dressed, and left the room, but not before leaving her my picture so that the kid would one day know who his or her father was. And with that I left, returning to base and eventually leaving 'Nam, never to return.

Early Morning Pipe felt like that special morning in Saigon.

VonSausage: Classic. There's another review out there (possibly by the same person) where he compares it to a hand job on the Orient Express. I'll try to find it later.

LaphroaigianSlip: I wonder if he was reviewing Orient Express. 
--
VonSausage: Possible. Maybe it just had orientals in it. Either way it was hilarious and, ultimately, had very little, if anything, to do with tobacco.

TheNutPair: LMFAO!!! I remember reading that review when I first started smoking.  My mind was blown.  What a classic.

davidy97: Here's one I found that I sprayed beer across the room when I got to the middle. Off of tobacco reviews:

I have been smoking this blend since 2004 or so and it ages extremely well. I have had Carole adjust the maple topping + and - over the years depending on my views on aromatics at the time. Although I like Autumn Evening's maple topping better, VMC blows it away with the variety of leaf in the blend and it is top shelf all the way. Nary a bite, smells heavenly and tastes like Pancake stacks with butter and syrup. I had just given my GF a nice Creampie, went out to the living room to light my pipe with this and when I went back into the bedroom she said I smelled like delicious waffles! Pipeworks tobacco's are getting a bit expensive but you do get what you pay for... Carole is nice enough, occasionaly I get a one word reply to my emails and she sometimes is a little short on the phone but not more than say calling Peretti's...

Please do try her blends as she has been doing this for quite awhile and I am sure that retirement cannot be that far away. A real pipe tobacco mecca up there in Vermont and no one compares...

p4ttythep3rf3ct: Wow, been wanting to try EMP for a while..this review totally put me off.  Must be guy-humor, because the person who wrote that review is a clear piece of shit or a liar, or both.  There's nothing cool about siring spawn and then leaving it to fend for itself.  What a deadbeat.  And sorry to be such a Debbie Downer here, but really, what a piece of shit.

RippinTrout: Well this reviewer also reviewed Prince Albert and spoke about knowing the man personally, and his review of Billy Budd was just the lyrics to Barbecue Stain by Tim McGraw. 

I kind of assumed that people would gather that this wasn't a real account of a Vietnam veteran killing "10 Charlie" before making love to a Vietnamese woman 30 times, [but I guess I was wrong.](https://m.imgur.com/w1Y47C5)
