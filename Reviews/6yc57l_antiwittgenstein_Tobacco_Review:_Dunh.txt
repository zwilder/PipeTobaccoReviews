Tobacco Review: Dunhill Flake
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 89

**Blend Name:** Dunhill Flake
 
**Description on Tin:** There is actually nothing on the tin. Smokingpipes says:

Dunhill Flake is a medium strength flake of selected grades of Lemon and Bronze Virginias. One of Dunhill`s most expert blends of highest quality.

**Leaf:** Standard looking virginia flake, chocolate brown with some yellow variegation.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisins, hay, dirt right before the rain, something vaguely floral

**Age when smoked:** Just about a year.

**Taste:** Fruit and hay flavors. The fruit is on the plummy jammy side of things. There is an undercurrent of tobacco spice. There is a good earthy quality to this, making the hay broader if that makes any sense. The flavors are full and rich, reminiscent of a good Connecticut wrapper cigar. Maybe a touch of fresh, green apples? Towards the middle of the bowl gets this deeper earth and leathery notes. Really this a flake for cigar smokers. Juicy plummy bits and hay rotate through, the spice is a constant backdrop.

And it is here, about 2/3s through the bowl, which I find every time I have to set the pipe down because my head is awobble. This stuff is stout, particularly for a Virginia.

When I come back to it, usually the next day, if not a few days later:

Smoky. A bit burnt rubber on the first relight, but it that fades, leaving just a pleasant, woodsy type smoke to the remainder of the smoke. The flavors shift generally darker and a bit more muted. The plummy flavors come back to the fore, the cigar and hay pretty much gone. It is earthier and more contemplative, less showy. Leans towards Full Virginia Flake territory or even Solani Aged Burley Flake. For those of you who employ Delayed Gratification Technique, this is probably a stunner. Even after the 20 minute bowl my vision is a bit soft and I need some sugar immediately.

**Nicotine:** 5, much stronger than any straight Virginia has a right to be.

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

**Smokability:** The first time – and forgive me, on several other occasions – I was in a hurry and stuffed a roughly folded flake into my pipe. And it smoked amazingly well, even if it was admittedly much damper than I like to smoke anything. It needs relights here and there, but it really quite friendly. 
 
**Room Note:** N/A

**Thoughts:** I had this sitting in my cellar from last summer, and with the news that once again Dunhill was going to abandon distribution, at least in the US, I wanted to see if it is something I need to stockpile. My verdict: I might get a spare tin, but it isn’t something I find myself craving. The flavor is good, but easily substituted for by many, many other blends, and usually at a lower price. What is unique about Dunhill Flake is the amazing strength for this variety of smoke – however, for my needs, I don’t want a high nicotine straight Virginia. If I want power, relaxation, a thought blocker, a bad day emergency thought brake, I have a nice little set of burley blends. What I want from Virginia is something for my brain and sense to work on, a puzzle to unlock and enjoy. The power just gets in the way of that experience. But I know there are many other smokers who need this exact thing in their cellar and rotation. For those I would recommend shelving a few tins.

What will really be missed when Dunhill pulls up stakes is the ubiquity of high quality flake like this in every cigar shop that happens to sell a few tins. I’ve not been to many brick and mortars, but every single one has had this amongst their often meager offerings. It is isn’t the best on the market, but having something widely available and quality is something that will be missed. It is like Starbucks – sure it is overpriced and most towns have a better stand alone coffee shop, but when you are traveling it is nice to have the reassuring familiarity and dependability everywhere you go.

**Similar Tobaccos:**  Fresh light: PS Navy Flake, PS Luxury Flake, DE Luxury Gatsby Flake
Pre-Smoked light: SG Full Virginia Flake, Solani Aged Burley Flake

**Summary:** An easy to smoke plum and rich hay Virginia Flake with a burley like kick.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 3 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), H&H Ten to Midnight(English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).
**Rating:**++

Rating system (interpreted through the wonders of moving):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Not being woken up at 2:23 AM on a Tuesday morning by the caterwauling of some drunk frat boy)

(++++) Great (Living in a nicer place with less rent)

(+++) Very good (Hey, I haven’t seen that for years!)

(++) Good (Some of these appliances are at least made this millennium)

(+) I think like it (Playing tetris with all your worldly goods)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Moving fast food)

(-) I think I dislike this (What’s that smell?)

(--)This is not for me (Why do I continue to buy physical books by the literal box load?)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (Why does nothing fit?)

(----)This is suffering (Running face first into the wall at night repeatedly because you keep forgetting where you are)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Scrubbing every last inch/centimeter/fathom of two apartments in the same week)

freepancakesforall: Awesome review once again. Thanks!

crimblade: Thanks for reviewing this one! I've been tempted to add this to my orders for awhile now and had pretty much decided I wouldn't with them pulling out. This review helps solidify that decision since I won't be missing out on something amazing.

antiwittgenstein: It's not often my reviews save people money. This might be a first.

Yeah, honestly I would throw that money towards another McClelland offering you've not hit yet, or maybe get out into the weeds like F&T, Rattrays, or Wessex. I still need to head thataways myself. I guess really I need to dip into those Rattray Flakes that are supposed to be bonkers strong and see how Dunhill compares.

zero-hunter: I've never had a mcclelland VA. Where should I start?
--
antiwittgenstein: While many, many people, including a pipe smoker with I am going to presume, impeccably groomed hair /u/freepancakesforall will recommend 5100, that stuff is pretty flat fresh off the truck and needs about 5 months in the jar to become decent.

If you want something good on mail week, Blackwoods is the best I've had from McC, and quite possibly my all time favorite tobacco. It does take a day or two to dry well enough to smoke - that is literally a day or two, not hyperbole, depending on your local humidity conditions - but jaw droppingly good.

If you are more of a VaPer fan, the McC 2015 VaPer Flake is outstanding.

I actually need to follow my own advice and order about 10-20 more Mclelland VA tins now we are on the subject... Apologies to the future wife and grand kids.
--
freepancakesforall: 1. Blackwoods is indeed stellar    
2. My hair is indeed impeccably groomed
--
zero-hunter: Blackwoods has been on my list for a while. I've stayed away from McClelland for a bit after a number of their English blends just would not dry out enough for me to smoke them comfortably. I was also told just how hard the mechanics are for Blackwoods. But I'll pop a tin in the cart next time I order. 
--
grimstuff: Another upvote for Black Woods. My fave from Mcclelland so far and in my top 3 overall
--
chewsyourownadv: Dry it. Smoke slow. It's a great Virginia.
--
freepancakesforall: An ounce of 5100 is the best starting point. Any of the Matured Virginias is also a good start. Or the 40th Anniversary. 
--
givemeyours0ul: Anniversary, Christmas cheer, Blackwoods, Dark Star, 27, 25.
--
givemeyours0ul: Hal o the wynd is excellent.

givemeyours0ul: While I love OPs reviews, I disagree in this case.  This stuff is 4* for me, I'm pretty heavy on it. I have more dark flake though. I'm not sure which "many blends" are both equal to it and cheaper, this isn't a "premium" priced blend like de luxe navy, it's standard dunhill price.  It's currently $7. 50 on p&c, $10.95 on SP. The only one blend I could imagine being greatly cheaper would be a Stokkebye offering, and I personally find them quite inferior. Also, including Gatsby Luxury flake as similar is an insult to *my* existence. Oh and the solani aged burley flake is $12.95.

I highly recommend you get a tin each of flake and dark flake.

LegesAequitas: Definitely a must review tobacco. Glad you got to it! I love this stuff, but I must admit that I don't get the nicotine hit you talk about for some reason, and I consider myself a lightweight. It's interesting how tobaccos treat people differently. I definitely agree that it's pretty full flavored for a Virginia flake.

====================================
Lbarraa: I like that Flake, Dunhill's Flake great quality and tasty! Highly recommended!
