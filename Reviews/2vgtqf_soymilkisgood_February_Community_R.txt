Put your reviews in here. 

Give a star rating, up to five stars (the best rating) in your review please.

Can't wait to read these. 

Edit: Also, if you would please add what pipe(s) you smoked it in and dry time as well as packing method I think it would help a bit with helping others envision your smoking style/circumstances of the review. Thanks!
====================================
ChefPD: I'm just going to give an opinion, not necessarily a proper and formal review. 

To begin with, this stuff is super moist. Nice, dark flakes, easy enough to rub out and doesn't need too long to dry to perfection. Burns well, no bite, nasal exhale stings slightly.

Flavor profile is really nice, I'm not good at these things, but it's really as natural as tobacco can taste, or so it seems in comparison to what I've had. I get that "pepper" flavor for sure, and that's why I like it so much. I don't generally go for straight VA's, because I can't enough flavor and/or variety out of them. Kind of sweet, but mostly savory - it has the preserved fruit tinge that I get from many VA's which is nice in comparison to the earthy perique.

I got mine as a sample from /u/crimsonrat, but I'm going to have to get some more for when it runs out. I'm just starting to get into vaper's, and this has been a warm welcome to that style of blend. In the past, I've been almost exclusively a latakia blend smoker, but this is changing my opinion. A good blend, but as I'm also starting to collect aged tobacco's, I can only imagine how good this would be with 5-10 years on it. 

I'd recommend it to any kind of smoker, there's really no offensive flavors like people find in latakia's and aromatics. If you like tobacco, I think you'll like this blend.

**RATING:** 4/5. Didn't absolutely blow me out of the water, but I liked it alot and if I were to try it aged, I think I could give it that 5/5.

PipeBeard: I'm not going to follow the full and proper review format, but here are my thoughts.

I'm a Gawith fan, especially their VA flakes.  Surprisingly, I haven't tried this one until this community review, and I've smoked a half tin in the last three days or so, and will finish it up by the weekend.

Initial impressions:  The tin note is wonderful, and shouts perique.  There is a lot of the typical VA tin note, but the stewed fruit wins out.  It's got some nice hints of raisin and almost cognac notes.  The flakes are cut nice and thick (thicker than best brown, but not as thick as chocolate flake - just right).  Gawith blends are moist.  We know that.  I laid them all out on paper towels for a few hours and they dried rather nicely.  For there, I rubbed the first flake out and let it dry for a half hour to 45 minutes, and it was dry enough to smoke down to ash.  The rest of the flakes were jarred, which allowed them to reconstitute a little, so I've dried each one for a bit before folding and stuffing.  That way, the moisture has been ok (still could use a bit more dry time, but I've been impatient b/c I like it).

Charring light:  On the first match, this one has been a bit pepper forward for me.  Through the rest of lighting, I get puffs of VA and puffs of perique, but when it is all lit and ready to go, I get them both married well into a nice, middle of the road, somewhat mellow, musty/fruit, lightly peppered VA/Per.  Gawith's VA is top notch, and it's in there big time. This is ST James perique.  To me, this blend is done right, so as to showcase the perique, but not overpower.  I know that perique can get peppery/spicy, but after the lighting and first quarter of the bowl, this settled in for me and really leaned towards the stewed fruit and raisin liquer notes with just a dash of pepper.

Smokability varied by pipe.  [This](http://imgur.com/a/IdFjT) is my winning combo, my Radice rind straight, Dublin, plateau...thing.  The short straight, open, no-nonsense draw and tall narrow bowl gave me the best of this blend, while I feel like I didn't get all of the depth in stouter bowled, bent stemmed pipes. When dried right, as I mentioned, this one smoked right down with virtually no relighting.

The winner here for me is the namesake's perique.  I know there are a number of other blends that feature this, but I think done in these proportions, kept musty/fruity and not overly peppery, against Gawith's VA, works really well for me.  This will probably find it's way into my rotation.

Not as strong as FVF, not as peppery as Sixpence, not as perique heavy as Escudo (all three are blends I'm very fond of, and they're in my rotation).  This will fit into that "just right" category on some days.

Overall, I'd say 4/5.  I would order 8oz to smoke and an extra tin to see how well it ages.

Also, as /u/ice_09 said, this one's got a nice mustache note :)

Mordenkrad: Es hard to light, hard to smoke, bites, comes packt wetter than a preteen at a One Direction meet and greet, and seems to be pretty particular about what you smoke it in.

It's also one of the best tasting VaPers in existence. It isn't good, it's essential. This is the benchmark to which all other periques must aspire and overcome. 

10/10 Best Perique.

====================================
MetalEd: Review one of my favorites for eternal flame and glory?  Ok.

**The tobacco:** July 2012 bulk.  Sopping wet when jarred, dried by leaving the jar open for three days straight, then sealing again for three days. 

**The pipe:** Brigham three dot bent. . Something.  Good VA smoker, nice wide draw, medium bowl.

**The Pairing:** Braggot Mead.  Dry and sweet at the same time. 

http://www.imgur.com/eZrecpr.jpeg

**Tin Notes:** 200% raisins and figs.  Nothing else discernable.  The Perique flows strongly. 

**The Pack:** Carelessly mush, fold, and stuff into bowl, pressing down hard with finger.  It's perfectly dried, as there is no impediment to the draw after this callousness. 

**First half:** Very earthy with a sweet bite from the Perique.  Without Perique this would be a DARK Virginia in its own right.  A lot of delicate flavours going much akin to Best Brown Flake that I fear are being overpowered by the mead.  My liver is also being overpowered by the 8.5% mead.  FACK.

*will come and update this once i smoke some more*

**Second half:** Now paired with Innis & Gunn Rum Finish. 
Dark Virginia tones with much muted Perique.  Very damp earthy flavours with a savory nose of sweet dried fruit.  Very delicious but needs to be paid attention to - not a smoke to puff away on thoughtlessly. 

**Final thoughts:** One of my favorites for years for good reason.  It's pretty much FVF with Perique, but only Gawith could properly pull off the blending of a rich earthy dark Virginia Flake with Perique. 

**4.8/5** - the 0.2 is missing because i like FVF slightly better and need to save the 5 spot.  Also it's not a casual smoke, and you have to be in the mood for it. 

**My background:**
Pipe smoker of 12 years that started with captain black and found Virginia flakes within months, and never moved on.  I LOVE VaPers.  I once smoked a pound of FVF in three weeks.

====================================
ice_09: **Overall – 4 out of 5 stars**

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith St. James Flake

**Description on Tin:** Genuine Perique is added to an already delicious and flavoursome blend of fine bright Virginias to give St. James the light peppery characteristic enjoyed by so many pipe smokers. Medium strength.

**Leaf:** Virginia and Perique

**Tin Aroma:** From the moment the seal was broken it was love at first smell. The tin note is sweet, tangy, sour and fermented. There is the nice Virginia smell but I really pick up some fermented fruit. I can’t quite pick out which fruits exactly but it is really sweet and sour. You can pick up on the Perique here as well. Not as much as something like Chenet’s cake but it as a major player here.

**Taste:** The first light was a wonderfully fruit and cream flavor with some light spice on the retrohale. As it got going there were some nice sweet Virginia tobacco flavors, the standard fresh hay like flavor. After about 15 min or so the spice picked up a little bit and the Perique started to shine a little bit more though was still pretty mellow on the retrohale. Towards the end of the bowl it mostly fermented fruit and spice that I could taste. Like a soured fruity beer with a strong rye presence – it is VERY good in my mind. 

**Smokability:** I would say probably a 3 out of 5 on this one. I pushed it hard to see if I could get it to bite and it never did. That being said, this stuff was WET when it arrived and I pretty much just left it open on my desk for a couple of days, packed a pipe waited another day or two and then smoked it. It was still more moist then most tobaccos at that point. I could see this flake being a pain for a large number of smokers. I found the nicotine to be on the lighter side, I smoked it in the morning on an empty stomach with nothing to drink and I barely noticed the nicotine.

**Room Note:** The mustache note with this was pretty good, a nice sweet natural tobacco smell. I asked my wife what she thought and she told me “dirty old man…” I am not quite sure what to think about that; but I thought it was pretty good myself. 

**Thoughts:** The flavor is great and you can tell it is high quality tobacco, but there are so many other great tobaccos out there that this one just is not worth it for me.  I will probably end up keeping some in my cellar as it is some quality tobacco; but, I will be reaching for other tobaccos far more often.

**Recommend to:** Those who enjoy Va, VaPer and natural tobaccos

**Summary:** Overall a good tobacco that ships too wet for my preference. 

**My Background:** I have smoked a pipe for about ten years. My favorites are Va, VaPer, BurPer, with a sprinkling of English blends here and there. Some of my favorite smokes include Escudo, Tudor Castle, Chenet’s Cake, 1792 and Upvote

PhysicsNovice: My Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkFldByBFgg

Overall: 1-5/5

====================================
crimsonrat: Because I am terrible at these: 

This stuff is good. Like, damn good. Take my favorite flake: FVF, and mix in a little bit of the best stuff that comes out of Louisiana, and you get this. 

Like the other Sam Gawith stuff I've tried, some drying definitely helps it out. Once you get it rolling, however, it stays lit very well, and smolders all the way to the bottom. If you get a little overzealous with your rhythm, it will definitely bite, but no more than any other Virginia, in my opinion. 

I rub it out and then let it dry for 1-3 hours. Yup, hours. 

My score is 5/5, I buy it by the pound.

====================================
levins0: I picked up a tin of Firedance after some recommendations a week or two ago.  Since I was ordering anyway and wanted free shipping, and since we were doing this review, and especially since as a new pipe smoker I'm really leaning towards Virginias, I decided to also get a tin of St. James Flake.

I'm really glad I did.  It's wonderful.  Sweet, earthy, and surprisingly easy to smoke.

I took the flakes out of the tin and laid them out on a paper towel for two days.  They were nice and crispy, and I put them in a mason jar.  When I was ready to try it, I took a flake out and rubbed it out thoroughly, leaving it to dry more for another couple of hours, like /u/crimsonrat.  

I packed it into one of my cobs and lit it.  I'm finding that my usual routine is to do a couple of charring light/tamp down cycles, 2-3, and once there's a nice ash cap on top, I just have to lightly tamp every few minutes to keep it going.  This was the case -- I only had to relight twice when I waited a little too long between puffs.  

I even tried to heat it up a bit to see if it would bite, but it didn't.  

And the perique is fantastic.

5/5

====================================
None: Here are some thoughts I had while smoking St. James Flake.


- Fold and stuff: difficult to keep lit, although once it got to burning consistently,  wonderful spice and deep fruity flavor. Full body smoke, mild pleasant sweetness.
     

-Rubbed out and dried to a crisp: took to light easily, and stayed lit with no moisture issues. Immediately apparent grassy/hay sweetness, with retrohale bringing out notes of plum with a small hint of spice.


Aside from the flavors of the tobacco, I found it to be a fussy flake. It didn't stay lit right out of the tin, I had to dry it to a crisp for ease of lighting.  It also gave me minor tongue bite every time I smoked it, and I smoke slowly enough to not get bit by a number of Va/Pers that I enjoy  frequently. Despite these negative aspects, I'd give it a solid 3/5 stars. It's some tasty toby, but there are blends such as Cornell & Diehl's Bayou Morning that I'd rather go to when looking for that sweet Va/Per satisfaction.  I wouldn't order another tin, but I'll eventually get around to smoking this one, and maybe by that time it will have improved with age.

====================================
MetalEd: I was expecting more reviews. .
Perhaps a weekend would do better? 
--
ajpl: I'd say so. I think the nature of reddit is going to make it hard for a single-day thing to draw a lot of people, but if it were Community Review: Friday-Monday, there would be more room for discussion. Plus people are less busy.
--
MetalEd: I made an appointment in my calendar to remind me, though in truth last night I didn't really feel like doing it. . Perhaps community review **week** would do better. 
--
ajpl: Yeah, I think that's even better. It's already treated that way in part—people are still posting reviews today even though it was technically yesterday. I'm sure they'll continue to trickle in as long as this post is stickied. 
--
nstano: I'll be posting mine after work, for what it's worth!
I just have to type up my notes.
--
====================================
tripjilly: First Virginia I have really had. The best part for me is the first light. It was sweet and tobacco flavor. Just basic. As I continued to puff away I got some peppery notes. It was a good smoke that didn't need much of my attention once I got it dried. Which I managed to do buy placing it in some of the same tobacco that was crispy dry and soon everyone was at the right moisture. 

3 out 5

====================================
nstano: Ok, here are my thoughts. Keeping in mind two things:
1) I have never smoked a flake before
2) I have never done a review before

Here it goes.

St. James Flake
Appearance: Thick flakes, dark in color

Tin Note: At first, figs. With further analysis I also got rasins, dried or stewed stone fruits.

Pack: First a couple of terrible fold and stuffs, then rubbing out

Taste: Perique peppery notes throughout. When I did a fold and stuff I got more spice. When rubbed out I got more of a grassy flavor. Toward the end of the bowl I also got some coffee or chocolate notes.

Strength: mild/medium. Not the most perique forward blend I've had. 

Smokability: This tobacco was much wetter than I anticipated, and I'm not sure I have the drying time down. Early attempts bit my tongue good. Once it gets going, it smokes like a dream and burns to a very fine ash.

Thoughts: I was less than impressed at first, but I think that had more to do with user error than the tobacco itself. As I've gotten better at it, I have gotten more enjoyment out of it. 4/5

====================================
hedonaut: I'm days late, I realize, but here goes. My flakes set out to prep got a bit over dried, so I went for a cube cut to slow the burn down. With some kindling on top, set in the deep bowl of one of my Oom Pauls, and paired with a good unsweetened iced tea, I'm off to a good start. Initial flavor is a very sweet, round fruitiness paired with a dry, peppery bite. It's not tongue bite, but rather the bite of spicy food or fresh garlic. A moment aside to talk about this sweetness. This is by far the sweetest non-aromatic blend I know. I know cavendish comes in pretty sweet, but not being a fan of the stuff in large amounts, I can't rightly say how it compares. But this blend is so sweet it's almost off putting for someone not prepared for it. It's also incredibly full bodied for a VaPer. The smoke is thick, and almost chewy, the flavor coats the tongue in a way typically reserved for heavy Lat blends and burleys. 

As the smoke progresses, the two main voices of the flavor profile trade back and forth, weaving harmonies that shift as the burn temperature varies. At times the perique is in the fore front, pepper, a wine-like dryness reminiscent of a bold and tannic cabernet with a figgy undertone. At other times the VAs come to the forefront, brighter citrus notes over a bready, hay-driven sweetness. There's a slight grassy, herbal note sneaking subtly in to the VAs, difficult to imagine with stuff so dark and heavy. Where the two meet it creates an impression of perhaps a fruit cake, spicy enough for the grown ups with bursts of candied fruit. The balance is fantastic. By that I mean the different aspects of the flavor profile are all strongly present while not drowning anything out. 

I will say, in the end, this flake can bite. The dryness of the perique can also be a lot for the palate, but the flavor is so intensely good it's worth it to get to know. It's a difficult blend to handle. The wetness and density of the flake are a lot to work around when you;re not accustomed to flakes. I will say there are VaPers I prefer more, but not many, and I make it a point to keep plenty of this stuff around when I'm in the mood for it. 

To sum it all up: Very sweet, very full, very complex. Top notch stuff well worth the extra trouble of handling it.

====================================
ajpl: I love St. James Flake but I don't have any on hand, so I can't do a review this time around. :/

Some interesting thoughts in here, though!
