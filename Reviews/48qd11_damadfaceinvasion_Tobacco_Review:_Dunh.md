Tobacco Review: Dunhill Standard Mixture
By: damadfaceinvasion

I was looking for a new English blend to replace my recently depleted My Mixture 965.  MM965 really wasn't my cup of tea, but I did find it enjoyable by mixing it with Frog Morton, so I wanted something with the medium body of 965, but more "English." After reading tons of reviews a review by Stuff & Things of Dunhill Standard Mixture really stood out to me. He compared it to creosote that they put on docks, which actually appealed to me a lot, even though some people might find that repuslive.  On my way to donate some old clothes I popped into my B&M and picked up a tin for an arm and a leg because I'm an impatient man and didn't want to wait a few days from ordering on line.  When I got back to my house I popped the tin and was met with a pretty rancid smell. It was very strong, musty and almost...rotten? I checked the tobacco for mold and found none (it's pressure sealed so of course there wouldn't be, but I was kind of freaking out) after letting it air out for a bit the smell dissipated and became much more familiar. Mild smokey latakia with a bit of a spice smell, which is what it smells like to this day.   Being an impatient man again, I shoved some into my English oriented basket briar and lit it up. For the first third of the bowl I tasted nothing but the Virginia and a hint of Latakia. The Dunhill "harshness" that I'd come to revile was there too, that "cigarette-y" taste that  kept me from enjoying 965. I was bummed...id spent good money on this and I'd probably have to trade it away. Soon I started to notice more flavor, a kind of tangy spice that I now know as orientals revealed itself. Soon the smokey, tangy "creosote" taste revealed itself and by that time I could not put the pipe down. The flavors became more pronounced the closer to the bottom of the bowl I smoked. I smoked it for a good hour I'd say, all the way down to the bottom, which is unusual. I usually only smoke about 3/4ths of a bowl for most blends.  I put half of the tin into a jar for aging (after a night of drying) and the other half back in the tin for smoking.  It wasn't until my 3rd bowl that I enjoyed the pipe all the way through, and not just in the second half. It was also the first day where the weather was calm enough for me to smoke outside smoothly. So far I've smoked this blend almost every day for the past week, and I plan on smoking it tommorow as well, so you can tell where this is going

OK, down to the mechanics


**Leaf**: Fine ribbon cut

**Tin Aroma**:Mild Latakia mixed with orientals, smokey, but not overbearing like McClelland tins

**Taste**:Well balanced English. Smokey, tangy, slightly bitter, with a very small hint of Virginia sweetness. Medium bodied Virginias and Turkish complemented by Latakia. Nome of these elements overpower the other.   

**Smokability**:Easy to pack, easy to light, burns even down to the bottom, and I'm not an expert in packing technique. Great "no fuss" blend, which is what I like. Flavor doesn't reveal itself instantly, but when it does it stays consistent to the very end of the bowl. When I first got it I found that just letting it air out overnight made it far more pleasurable, now I can just pack it and smoke it. Oh yeah and that Dunhill "harshness" i talked about, by the end of the bowl it has a very "cigar" like quality as opposed to the cigarette like quality of 965. The smokey Latakia and Orientals really mix well with the typical "dunhill" after-taste that I actually find it quite pleasant. It does linger on your mouth a bit, but I actually quite like it. It's a nice flavor. Wouldn't call Standard Mixture "bite-free" but if you smoke at a reasonable pace it wont bite. Wind can really fuck it up though.

**Nicotine Level**: Medium of course.  Won't "hit" you like Night-Cap does, but it's there. I tend to get buzzed off this stuff since I'll smoke it all the way down to the bottom unlike other blends.

**Room Note**: Smoky latakia, cigar like "tobacco" smell. It will linger in your room for at least half the day, so I wouldn't call it an indoor blend, but it was raining when I got it so that's what I did. Again I'm an impatient man. 

**Recommend to**: Anyone looking for a medium bodied English blend to try. Might not knock your socks off, but it's definitely a good consistent, reliable English blend. Could easily be an "all day" smoke even though I don't do that. It's certainly an every day smoke for me. 


**My Background**:I've been smoking a pipe for a little over a year now. Pipe used was a "Lorenzo Spitfire" that I got out of a basket at a B&M and it's pretty much my go to pipe for smokey English blends

**Final Thoughts**:I think I put my finger on why I love this blend so much despite not liking 965 at all. 965 starts off with a sweet, mellow, leathery Virginia intro, before hitting you with the harsh Dunhill reality and leaves an aftertaste that reminds me too much of cigarettes. Standard Mixture starts off kind of bland, but then delivers on all of it's promises and even more, and leaves you with a smokey, tangy flavorful outro and leaves a nice "English" flavor in the mouth.  Funny thing is I don't really think of food items when I smoke a pipe tobacco, I think of places that it might remind me of. This one reminds me of a dock in the middle of industrial revolution era England, or a machine shop. I dig it a lot. 

I'd give it a 7 or a light 8/10 depending on when I'm smoking it and how windy it is outside.  Looking forward to trying either HH Whiteknight, Squadron Leader or Dunhill London Mixture next.

antiwittgenstein: Nice write up. Would this have a more Balkan taste to it from the orientals, or are are the tangy-smoky tastes more balanced? I've got a tin of this somewhere but I don't think I will get to it this winter, sadly.

damadfaceinvasion: I don't know. I haven't actually had a Balkan blend except Black House (or is it?) but I'd say it's overall a very balanced blend. I kind of want to try a "balkan" blend now though.

pixeechick: I would say it's more balanced. It's a great go-to for me.

Cycleoflife: Great write up. Glad you eventually took the time to dry it properly. I love this blend for many of the reasons you state. Easy to pack and smoke, balanced, great flavor and aftertaste. I don't get the "Dunhill harshness" you mention or the cigarette/cigar flavors. I personally don't get that from any Dunhill blends but everyone is different. Like you, I also did not care for 965. You should try Standard Mixture Mellow sometime. I think people avoid it because of the name, but it is actually a superior blend in my opinion. The Orientals and Virginias shine through a bit more due to the reduced Latakia.

damadfaceinvasion: I think it's because I never smoked cigs and started on McClelland blends which are very mild in my experience
