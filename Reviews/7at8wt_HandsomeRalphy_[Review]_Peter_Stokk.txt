**Name**: Peter Stokkebye Black Coffee

**Type**: Aromatic

**Leaf & Cut**: Ribbon Cut - Burley, Cavendish, Virginia

**Aroma**: Sweet aroma of - Coffee, Buttery Caramel, Vanilla

**Description**: Peter Stokkebye's Black Coffee is a blend of Burley, Virginia and black Cavendish, infused with a rich, slightly sweet coffee flavor. Great all by itself, it can also be a nice addition to blends with chocolate or whiskey flavoring. (via SmokingPipes)


**Thoughts**:  With the season changing, I am leaning more towards Aromatics. Wanting a morning smoke, I grabbed a 1 oz bulk bag from SmokingPipes. I had hopes that this blend was going to be coffee heavy, but those hopes dwindled when I first opened the bag to take a whiff. 

After having this blend in my house for about a week, I figured I may as well give it a go this morning. While it did not hit my expectations for a robust coffee flavor, what it did satisfy was my desire for a smooth, tasty, morning aromatic. A bit of the nutty burley came through, and you can taste the grassy virginia behind the topping. Tastes of caramel, and a light coffee flavor came through as well. The ribbon cut was easy to pack and keep this sweet, creamy smoke lit. Halfway through the pipe, I stopped off for an Iced Coffee, and boy did that pair really hit the spot. I was smoking this blend while driving around, and when I am driving and smoking I tend to puff a little too quickly, but this Aro just did not want to bite. Overall a solid aromatic choice for those who like a sweet aromatic, and it will be a morning/after meal staple for me. If you are looking for a dark, rich coffee flavor, you may want to try a different blend.

4/5.

FreestateFreehand: Good review! My experiences are similar...creamy caramel...maybe a bit of chocolate. I don't get *any* coffee, but I think it pairs really well with a cup. Solid job!

P.s - Find yourself some nutty chocolate-cased burley and you have yourself a Snicker's Candy Bar blend!

HandsomeRalphy: The coffee I get is like a coffee that had a bunch of flavored creamer and sugar in it, it’s just very slightly there.

antiwittgenstein: Nice write up, I was surprised you rated this so high after your write up, but I guess each baccy has to be judged against what it is trying to be. Did you want this considered for the contest?

HandsomeRalphy: Doesn’t matter if it counts or not, figured I would just try to start adding more than just mail call and what I’m smoking photos.  It was a solid aromatic, and I was just trying to rank it for what it was rather than what I expected of it.
