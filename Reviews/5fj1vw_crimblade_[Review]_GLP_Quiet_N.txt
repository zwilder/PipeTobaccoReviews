[Review] GLP Quiet Nights
By: crimblade
---
**Blend Name:** GLP Quiet Nights

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** Rich, deep, contemplative... Ripe red virginias, fine orientals, smokey Cyprus Latakia, and a pinch of Acadian perique are pressed and matured in cakes before being sliced. The sophisticated flavors and exotic aroma provide a wonderful backdrop for quiet moments of reflection, a good book, and if you are so inclined, perhaps a wee dram.

**Leaf:** Latakia, Oriental/Turkish, Perique, Virginia. Flake cut, though mine arrived in a more broken flake fashion.

**Tin Aroma:** Smokey leather. Deep and rich. The occasional whiff of grilled meat. A good earthy campfire.

**Taste:** Sweet earthy taste of the Virginians is the first thing I notice. This is supported or perhaps enhanced by the incensed campfire smoke of the Latakia. There is occasionally a hint of dark fruit from the perique, the only hint of peppery spice is on the retrohale. Creamy smokey on the retrohale brings the virginias even more forward. Occasionally I detect a sour note making an appearance but only ever after the half bowl point.

**Smokability:** The flakes crumble very easily, so much so that shipping can cause them to come partly crumbled. Like most GLP blends this one benefits from some decent drying time prior to packing. Once lit it has a nice even burn, although it was not unusual to need a couple relights along the way. This blend definitely benefits from ashing occasionally.

**Room Note:** Smokey latakia, slight incensey and sour. 

**Thoughts:** Quiet Nights is often considered to be a "Lat" bomb. However true that might be from an ingredient perspective it is less true from a smoking perspective. This is a blend that happens when the blender looks to create a latakia mix that doesn't rely on latakia as it's sole source of flavor. The depth of flavor to this blend is the reason I keep coming back for more. It's also got a Nicotine hit that will leave you feeling relaxed and at peace with existence. I actually prefer this blend to blends like Nightcap simply because I'm looking for that evolving flavor through out the smoke. Don't get me wrong, Nightcap is decent but it's a very one dimensional smoke where as Quiet Nights strives to be something more. This is a blend I will be stocking up on, with how much the virginias play a part in this smokes flavor profile I don't see how it won't get better, or at least evolve, with age.

**Recommend to:** Lat lovers who are looking for a bit more depth to their Lat bombs.

**Summary:** This blend is a merging of flavors that never fails to lead towards a delightful smoke. This blend is not meant to be a contender to Lat bombs like Nightcap, rather a different take on the notion of what a Lat bomb could be.

**Drink Pairings:**  Water usually, milk as well. A dram of scotch does in deed go well as advertised but I prefer to leave my palate untainted by alcohol to more fully enjoy the smoke.

**Final Rating:** 4/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 3 years with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Morton's Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
TastesLikeBees: Thanks for an excellent review. Sounds like I need to pick up some Quiet Nights.

IwishIwasunique: Awesome review. This sounds right up my alley! Where do you buy it? I checked, and P&C is backordered, showing $32is for 8oz. If I can find it, I want to give it a try.
--
crimblade: I've gotten it from both P&C and smokingpipes. However the last order I put in at P&C, 2 months ago, still has 3 tins of various GLP blends on backorder...

I don't know what it is about P&C and GLP being backordered, but it's annoying to say the least.

It looks like smokingpipes has it in stock, so I would definitely order from there at this point. 

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
--
IwishIwasunique: Thanks, will do!

carnesy: This stuff is amazing with a couple years of age on it, really an entirely different smoke from the fresh stuff. I popped a 3 y/o tin and split it with my buddy about 2 years ago and smoked mine up quick and was sad. Found out he still had his portioned jarred and untouched. I traded him some beer for it and am relishing the moment I can dip into the jar. 

I ordered 2x 8 ounce tins to age back in October from P&C but only got 1 with a back order notice on the other. No update since... Hope it comes in soon.
--
crimblade: I have several tins of GLP blends on backorder with them from September. I asked them about it when I saw two of them listed as being in stock and they said that there was a shortage and I would get my order in due time. Zero acknowledgement of the fact that they had shown them as being in stock.

Also they couldn't give an estimate on when I would get the tins. 

Ah well life goes on I guess.
--
carnesy: That's balls. They should fill the back ordered stuff first before they take new orders. I may try reaching out to them and see what they say, if they pull the "shortage" line on me I'll point out that their various competitors seem to have it in stock. If I don't get a good answer to that I'll have em cancel the order and buy elsewhere. 
--
crimblade: Agreed. Let me know what they say back, there's a good chance I'll just cancel mine as well if they don't have a reasonable answer to why other places have it stocked.

WrathoftheNorsemen: I'm a newer member here, just started smoking and I'm grabbing things that got stellar reviews here to determine my favorites.

This comment suggests that all of their stuff is really good - would you recommend others by them?

I'm hoping this one atleast makes me feel how Nightcap and Royal Yacht do, I've pretty much been in heaven everytime I come home, the name and reviews suggest this particular GLP will be up that alley.
--
crimblade: Quiet Nights is definitely up there on the Nicotine Strength though it and the blends I've listed below aren't as strong as Nightcap or Royal Yacht. That being said they'll still give you a nice buzz with the added bonus of a great flavor profile.

Here's my other two favorite GLP blends.

Gaslight - Dark campfire and grilled meats. If you really enjoy the lat flavor from nightcap then this is more on the same level when it comes to that flavor profile. It's got a great nic hit and just a really good smooth smoke flavor.

Sixpence - A VaPer with a bit of burley, though there are some on here that would claim it's a VaBur with a bit of perique. Either way it's an excellent blend that gives a more diverse flavor profile than your traditional VaPer Blend. This is further helped by an alcohol based topping. It has less of a Nicotine hit than Quiet Nights or Gaslight, but it's still an excellent blend and what you miss out from the Nic high you'll get back in an amazingly delicious smoke.

One other recommendation outside of GLP, but if you're looking for a nicotine punch in the face look into getting Happy Brown Bogie, it's a rope tobacco. It's amazing stuff and should be treated with care, please don't die.
--
WrathoftheNorsemen: I will check them out, thank you for taking the time!

====================================
PeskyPrussian: Excellently worded review. A joy to read as always. This is another blend that I haven't gotten around to yet but have seen favorable comparisons to other Englishes that I like very much. 
--
====================================
Alligator_Gar: I've smoked it aged and I've smoked it fresh, either way it's an all time favorite. I just don't tell anyone for fear it will disappear. Guess the cat's out of the bag.

crimblade: Sorry!

carnesy: As well you should be!
