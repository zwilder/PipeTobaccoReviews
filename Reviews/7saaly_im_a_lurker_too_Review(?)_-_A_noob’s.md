Review(?) - A noob’s first impressions of Stonehaven
By: im_a_lurker_too

After watching that dark, delicious looking flake /u/antiwittgenstein graciously sent me last month taunt me for weeks, I finally had a chance to try out this fabled blend.  Since Christmas, my immune system mightily battled hordes of malicious microbes that produced a log jam inside my sinuses and a persistent cough, rendering me unable to enjoy any fine tobacco products. This would be my reward for finally winning that battle…


**My background:**

I'm a relatively new piper having just picked up the hobby in early August. I've smoked cigars semi-steadily for over a decade, generally preferring medium to full-bodied sticks. I'm a 1-3x/week smoker depending on the season. I've experimented with over a dozen of this community's excellent suggestions and my go-to blend at the moment is Dunhill MM965.



**About this review:** 

Since I only had access to a single-bowl sample, this is more my first impression of the blend rather than a proper review.  I decided to go into this relatively “blind” and with as few preconceived notions as possible.  I know Stonehaven is made by Esoterica and that it’s well-reviewed, and relatively expensive.  With that in mind, I chose to load this tasty looking flake into my Savinelli Linea Piu 5 (which I held with pinky extended at all times).



**From the bag:**

I am immediately greeted by a powerful but, pleasing scent of dark dried fruits. - To my nose, it’s raisins and figs.
After a couple more inhalations, I pick up a bit of “moldering hay” smell like a dark, aged Virginia along with a slight “woody” note. It makes me think of someone tossing some fruit into the hayloft of an old barn and letting it ferment for a few weeks but, in an entirely pleasant sense.


**The Smoke:**

One of the first things I noticed about this blend was how incredibly “low-maintenance” it was.  It lit easily and stayed lit.  I could puff away at my leisure with little worry about tongue bite or frequent relights. I think I tamped only twice and my sample burned down to a fine ash with only a slight bit of dottle.

In my first few draws, there was actually very little initial taste. The taste was “generic light tobacco” with a slight woody note.  After a minute though, the blend began to shine for me. I began to notice an *amazing* retrohale: dark, tangy fruits (black currant comes to mind for me) and a little hint of cocoa.  If I judged blends solely by how much I enjoyed the retrohale, this would be my favorite. I did also pick up some of the fruit notes on my palette in stronger draws.  As I continued smoking, I began to notice a touch of spice on my tongue.  Not peppery but, more like a cooking spice.  I also picked up something vaguely earthy in the background and was left with a slightly sweet aftertaste lingering in the back of my mouth along with the spice in between draws.  In the last third of the bowl, the fruit notes fade a bit and another flavor tickles my palette behind the wood and spice.  It’s reminiscent of a dark bread to me but, not quite.  This blend has a bit of a dry, powdery mouth feel. It’s similar to some LJP blends I’ve smoked but, not nearly as pronounced.

Smoke production is a bit lighter than what I would have expected.  I’ll call it “light-medium”. 

On the room note, my non-smoker wife says “Eh, it smelled better when you weren’t smoking it.”  Once again, I’ll call that “Tolerable”.  
One vaguely interesting note: After exiting the room and coming back later, the lingering smell reminded me of burnt toast.  That’s a first with tobacco for me.


Overall, I get the impression that this is supposed to be a multilayered “connoisseur’s blend”.  While I was initially underwhelmed with my first few draws, the retrohale blew me away and I kept noticing a few lingering flavors that I was unable to place build up as I continued to smoke.  As smoker whose palette is anything but refined, I really feel like I had to “work” a bit to truly enjoy this blend.  This is definitely not something I’d smoke regularly (even if it was available) but, in the right frame of mind, I can see myself enjoying this.  I’d never pay secondary market prices for it but, I’d happily pay MSRP for an ounce or two at my favorite retailer (if it’s ever in stock) to properly evaluate.


**The TL;DR**

Body: Mild-medium

Taste: Dark aged Virgina and some other stuff - Woody, with some spice and sweet fruity notes, strong, delicious dark fruit retrohale.

Smoke production: Slightly below average

Room Note: Tolerable

My overall score: “Quite good, would buy more but, wouldn’t smoke it regularly.”


Thanks again to /u/antiwittgenstein for organizing the recent review contest and generously donating some expensive leaf to plebs like me.  ;)  With 99% of my piping knowledge coming from this sub, I feel I owe you guys some more quality reviews.  I have a lot of material in my recent [mail call](https://imgur.com/gallery/sCAGE) so, if there’s something you’re curious about, let me know!

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Glad to know you are back to health and that you enjoyed the stuff. Thanks for sharing your viewpoint - it seems a balanced view between 'greatest of all time' to the jaded 'basically an expensive version of Carter Hall'. I am very happy about you continuing with your high quality reviews.

im_a_lurker_too: Thank you, sir!  It's been a lot of fun.  Plus, it's a great response when the wife balks at my smoking.

Her: "You're smoking *again*?"

Me: "Honey, I *owe* these people a good review!"

====================================
Nicepuro: As a young aspiring surfer stuck in university economics classes, I smelled opium for the first time. It smelled like half grandma and half stinky antique shop. After traveling the mountains of Thailand and visiting an opium den (I didn’t exhale) I understood the smell and thought it was the deepest, most complex fragrance I had ever encountered. This same experience I found in Stonehaven. It smokes great and is very enjoyable for me, but that walk back in the garage thing 20 minutes later and wow. I love that stuff. 
Great review, you write well and I hope you do many more brother, thanks.

im_a_lurker_too: Wow.  You know you're sampling some special leaf when it gets compared to opium! That's another "first in tobacco experiences" for me. 

Glad you enjoyed the review and thanks for the kind words!
