Tobacco Review: Carter hall

Review #47

**Blend Name:** Carter Hall

**Description on Tin:** Carter Hall has been providing a straightforward and enjoyable smoking blend at an affordable price since 1895 by keeping things simple: ribbon-cut Virginia and Burley leaf of good quality, combined in the right proportions
 
**Leaf:** The most standard of the stand pipe tobaccos – nutty brown short ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisins, vanilla, rum
 
**Taste:** Bright. Lemony, then oranges - fresh squeezed orange juice that is just a tad too acidic to sit easily with a cup of coffee in the morning. I have smoked this tobacco perhaps more than any other in my collection, but I am always surprised by how it tastes. I expect the nutty dirge of its rival, Prince Albert, as the two look and smell the same, in similar old fashioned pouches, at similar prices. But this is no Burley affair, this is a solid Virginia, wrapped up in OTC plastic, sold to the unsuspecting smoker as a Tuesday Night knocker. Okay, back to the tobacco. The hard citrus edge is softened somewhat by a growing sweetness and quickly developing depth. Dried fruits, raisins, prunes show faintly here, but start building, the steady drumming march of darkness towards the bright acidity we have seen in the first act. Soon enough they come together, filling out on the palate. Where is the Burley? Well you taste it in what you don’t taste – the hard edges of the Virginia are pushed back, and the slightest nuttiness comes through on the finish. It is hard to believe it is not pure Virginia at this point. Close your eyes. Do you feel that wom-wom-wom, that giddy dizziness? That’s Burley. But with each passing puff it reminds me more and more of Full Virginia Flake – minus the two day drying time. As it barrels into the last third, the Virginia finally flattens out and it becomes a little duller. Sometimes old fashion burley, toast and nuts, that shows up, sometimes little peeks of Virginia show up, the light, citrusy notes where it all began. An ignominious end, compared to the greatness of the beginning and middle, but hey, you can stop and load up another pipe any time you want.

**Nicotine:** Fairly lively for an OTC.

**Smokability:** Number 1 A+. The only tobacco I have ever one matched. Doesn’t bite, easy to pack.  
 
**Room Note:** Toasty and a bit tobaccoy.

**Thoughts:** This is one of those tobaccos that don’t need to be reviewed, because everyone smokes it, but that ends up with no one reviewing it ([unless they get tricked into it]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/30zl72/review_ucrimsonrats_mystery_tobacco/)). If you haven’t smoked it, you are doing yourself a huge disservice. I cannot think of another blend that would exceed Carter Hall for an introduction to pipe smoking – it is tasty and so easy to work with. But even with an absurd number of tobaccos at hand, I find myself reaching for this quite often. I especially like it for a travel smoke – i.e. walking back home after a few drinks. It is good enough that when it really gets roaring I can stop and contemplate my pipe, but if I get distracted and don’t, well it is still a nice companion, and strong enough to mellow me out. Really, an all time classic.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Three Friars, Erinmore, Stonehaven, Full Virginia Flake, Elizabethan Mixture, Anniversary Kake

**Summary:** A perfect smoking tangy Virginia-Burley OTC blend.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 year ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

antiwittgenstein: I like most music from the 1780-Last Week - but something about the wishy-washy pop that dominated the rock scene from 1978-1983 really doesn't appeal to me. My apologies for having incorrect opinions.
--
====================================
Mordenkrad: NOT A 10/10?

It's time to bring the PAAAAIN TRAIN.
--
antiwittgenstein: It needed a bit more complexity to get those extra points. Gotta leave some room up there at the stop for the Borkum Riff reviews I still have to do.
--
====================================
Cycleoflife: That is next level with the "halls." well done, sir. And no, I have not tried it
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks, I was searching for something topical and it came easy to mind. Give it a poke when you get the chance. It is not gonna be the best thing you ever smoked, but it is hard not to respect a tobacco this good that is this cheap. It is like finding that great $15 bottle of Bourbon - maybe not the best thing in my bar, but I have immense respect for it.
--
====================================
NomadicPiper: Good review of a much over looked, unremarkable tobacco. It has it's place, and I know some people here like it. I rate it as "it's not that bad, and it's a decent smoke."
--
Mordenkrad: its like a good bad movie, it's so unremarkable that its remarkable again. 
--
====================================
BWeice: Sold! in the bin it goes to be delivered.
--
antiwittgenstein: You will not regret it. 
--
====================================
Kofcandre: I wish they offered a happy medium it goes from 1 oz pouch to 10 pound barrel. 
--
antiwittgenstein: The pouch I got was 1.76 oz. But that's not much more if you are a dedicated smoker. I've gone through maybe 20-30 bowls of this stuff in the last say 6 months and still have plenty left to burn.
