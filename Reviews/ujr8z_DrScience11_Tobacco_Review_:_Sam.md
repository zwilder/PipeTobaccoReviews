Tobacco Review : Sam Gawith's Squadron Leader
By: DrScience11
---
**COMING SOON** : Still working on Early Morning pipe. Also house blends. Sorry things have been slow, I smoke less when home from school.

**Blend Name**: Squadron Leader

**Description on Tin**:Bright and Dark Virginias blended together with Latakia and Turkish leaf to make this a cool medium bodied smoke.

**Looks**: A beautiful mixture of light and dark. Looks just like the pictures you see on websites.

**Smells**: Nice and smokey, as all latakia/english blends should be. There's more of the meaty, bacon-like scent in this than campfire notes in blends like nightcap. There's also a hint of sweetness reminiscent of virginias. 

**Taste**:  The standard you'd expect from english. Campfire smoke!  The description describes it as medium, and that is accurate. It's a softer, gentler english than something spicey like nightcap.  The meaty, bacon flavors are more pronounced in this than other english blends.  There's a hint of nuttiness, but not nearly as much as the comparatively mellow skiff mixture.  This is a good, middle of the road english in terms of flavor. More complex than say, frog morton, less busy than night cap. Very middle path (buddhist shout out!)

**Compare to** : Nightcap, Frog morton, skiff mixture, any english.

**Summary**:  In reviewing this tobacco, I was faced with a challenge to remain unbiased.  When I joined this reddit, this stuff was the s*&%. Every other post was about how great squadron leader was. When I got to taste it a few months ago (thanks pipeweed!) I was a bit disappointed it didn't live up to the hype. Now that I have a tin and can review it properly, (again, thanks pipeweed!), I tried very hard to remain impartial, and scientific in my process.

I failed. I still felt a bit disappointed. The flavors that make a good english blend are all there. Smokey campfires, cool smoke, a hint of nuttiness, and well rounded richness. But there's nothing AMAZING here.  I suppose it's strength lies in it's balance. It really does strike a very good medium, and that probably led to its popularity. I'd suggest this as a really good "starter" english. If you like this, but want a bit more spice and "oompf", try some nightcap. If you felt it was a bit too busy, head towards some softer blends like frog morton or skiff mixture.  For some of you, it'll be just what you need. Cool smokiness, subtle nut flavors, meaty richness.

**Rating : 4/5**

**My background**: Peterson's Irish Oak, Samuel Gawith's Full Virginia Flake, and Dunhill's nightcap are my favorite blends. I am a fan of Virginia and English blends, but I also like some aromatics, like 1Q and Dan's Blue. I've been piping for almost 9 months, and smoke frequently.

====================================
Do_what93: While I hear raves about Squadron Leader, I usually hear the Skiff is better (or at least, more popular).  I've had Squadron before, but not Skiff.
--
DrScience11: Really? Most people I talk to have heard of squadron but not skiff.  I like 'em both. It'd be kinda hard for me to pick one over the other.
--
Do_what93: SL is definitely more popular.  But from those that have tried both I have heard a general preference for Skiff.  While it's all up to personal tastes, some people just don't like perique. 
--
DrScience11: That makes more sense to me. Personally I enjoy the pepperiness, even in high concentrations like nightcap. But yea I can DEFINITELY see a preference for skiff if you're adverse to perique.

====================================
renholder: Another great review! I'm glad that you tackled this blend, I've never tried it, but the hype over it was unbelievable. Buddhist shout out received, sending a "stay mindful my friend" your way!
--
DrScience11: I'm glad you can relate about the hype.  It really made me think this stuff was god's gift to pipe smokers for a while

====================================
noreallyimgoodthanks: I have a tin in the mail. Your review sounds like it is exactly I was looking for! Thanks!
--
====================================
Frostie2013: Like other Samuel Gawith blends they seemed to have changed recently.  The tins I have from 07 have a much more nutty/smokey flavor.
--
====================================
urchin9899: i found this very informative i hope to see more from you
 
--
DrScience11: Thanks! I review as often as my budget allows!

====================================
BarkingLeopard: Thanks.  These reviews are very helpful for new smokers like myself, especially as the sheer number of pipe tobacco selections available online can be overwhelming at first.
