Review: Fuzzy's Moonwalk

Let me start by thanking Fuzzy (u/Fuzzy_Totemz) for sending out these different blends.  I would also like to state, my ability to pick out subtle tastes and flavors is rubbish! Also, my laptop kept rotating the picture for reasons I can't understand or fix!

Date: 9-29-2017 @4:05pm CST
Weather: Sunny 75F with a 3mph wind
Drink: Coffee but waited until 10 minutes into smoking
Pipe: Peterson 303 p-lip, very clean
Smoking Style: puff, retrohale, inhale 
Smoke Time: 48 minutes not including 10 minute rest to test relight
Nic Level: mild for me

Tin Note: Flipping fantastic!  I put the note at a tie with Officers Club.  It smelled like beautifully fresh ground coffee!

Texture: Holy crap this is some moist tobacco!  Almost as moist as.....well I'll leave it open for interpretation!

First Light:  This stuff fired right up and stayed lit with very few relights.  I was surprised due to the moistness of the tobacco.  This has to be the most effortless smoking i've done.  Burns great!

First Impressions:  The first taste was most definatley coffee.  It wasn't overpowering but felt balanced.  After 10 minutes, i paired this blend with my 10oz of coffee with a hit of french vanilla creamer.  Once I started this, the two amplified the experience of both!  Really enjoyed the combination.  This was really smooth,creamy, and cool.  

Wife's Impression:  She absolutley loved the smell from the bag!  I brought the pipe in the house and blew some smoke in her direction.  Although she thought it smelled good, not good enough to pipe in the house (I suspect that will always be the answer!).  She said it reminded her of a black and mild.  Understand, my wife doesn't mean this as a bad thing.  She used to smoke them and said the smell reminded her of high school and good times.  

Flavors:  It smoked and tasted like coffee.  I swear it had a hint of Amaretto or something.  Couldn't really put my finger on it!

Overall: This was a really good blend.  For me, it was a little bit lighter of a smoke than i prefer.  I suspect fuzzy will hit me with the freight train on the Mustache Blend!  But I suspect this is what he intended (ie MoonWalk, smooth and Mustache, hard).  I will continue to rotate this in during the coming days and have a friend who I'm certain is going to beg me for the rest of the jar!  Thank you for taking the time and effort to experiment with different blends.  Your blend is great and keep up the good work!

Fuzzy_Totemz: Thanks wang, love hearing it works as advertised.   
  
It's as smooth as a Michael Jackson moonwalk and pairs wonderfully with actual coffee.  
  
Moonwalk=Allday/Early Morning/LateNight    
Original=Allday   
Instant Mustache=I TELL YOU WHEN TO SMOKE ME  
  
You definitely want to reach for moonwalk after you've had a bowl of Instant Mustache but still want to smoke. It's the cream to soothe your spicy mouth.

wangchung80: I can’t state in words how good that blend is with some coffee!  Now tell Wang if there was anything resembling amaretto in there. Haven’t tasted amaretto in 15 years but something seemed close. It’s been driving me up the wall ever since!

Fuzzy_Totemz: No. The notes are honey, coffee, vanilla, and nuts. The vanilla and honey are just echoes though. It combines to make a buttery cream smell and a nutty palate flavor.   
  
I wanted it to smoke like straight burley white a nice white ash but have enough flavors to make the morning cup of joe blossom and vice versa.  Seasoned yes, but not a goopy aromatic.
