Miskatonic Mixture - Review

====================================
chewsyourownadv: It started simply and innocently enough, bent as I was over a recent reprinting of *Liber Ivonis* and wondering at some newly deciphered and peculiar reference to a forgotten Hyperborean god. These reprints and new editions, I swear that they prey on the curious mind, new discoveries and translations slyly intermixed with more bombastic horseshit, provoking further inquiry and, as I'm sure the "academics" intend, more purchases. Skepticism has always played a role in my hesitance to build out my own home library. My own texts would not suffice to study this subject further, but it has always been easy enough to venture across Arkham to my old alma mater's unrivaled library. Regret, anger, fear, these colors now taint my formerly practical procrastination.

You see, I do enjoy the briefest visit to Miskatonic University's old gift shop. As the the campus has grown, modernized, become subtly less recognizable over time, the gift shop traffics in many of the same curios decade after decade. It *does* update its shelves with new fads on occasion, and I was delighted in this visit to find that it had jumped into the newfangled niche tobacco market, and introduced its own blend! Miskatonic Mixture, it was called, and apparently popular, being the only tin left on the shelf. What a treasure, perfect for the evening's endeavor! Few outsiders know this of Miskatonic's famed library, but a wink and a nod, and perhaps a minor favor owed, will see that the librarian allows one to puff out of sight, in comfortable solitude.

My pipe was packed and lit as I headed toward the library. It was good... phenomenally good, better than I would expect of a university gift shop novelty. It gave me pause, demanded that I take a moment to appreciate the mild sweetness and floral quality one normally doesn't find in such an earthy VaPer. I was taken so thoroughly by this first impression, that I was inclined to ignore the movement of the object in my pocket. We do get used to our cell phones' incessant buzzing, don't we? Such was my misfortune that I was so enraptured with this mixture, that I made such an assumption and ignored the movement of the tin in my coat pocket.

It has now been hours since I arrived at the library, consuming bowl after bowl of this tobacco. It has demanded my continual attention; things go awry when I let it sit unattended for even a few minutes. My evening's intention is now wasted, thoughts of Hyperborean entities long faded from mind. No, there will be no academia tonight; even the librarian has excused himself from my presence for the evening. Tonight I can only rifle through old tomes of a more... practical nature. Perhaps I can cobble together the means of sealing this presence back inside the tin from which it occasionally wriggles forth, even as I continuously consume the tobacco that I presume has thus far barred its entry to our world. My notes, thus far:

**Blend Name**: Miskatonic Mixture

**Blender's Description**: Amidst the old tomes in a remote corner of the library, you discover an obscure reference to an occult recipe: a pinch of granulated Perique over a bed of Katerini and Virginia, finished with a dash of sweet black Cavendish to cure the Madness.

**Leaf**: A typical ribbon cut, mottled browns, reds, and off-black. Normal in its appearance, easy to load. It possesses all the signs of normalcy, a necessary comfort. No cause to suspect anything darker is afoot, although that black Cavendish is more abundant than a "dash." What mystery does this hide, and dare I waste my precious time considering it? I've studied the leaf several times over by now, and by the gods I can see it move out of the corner of my eye as I pour over rites of containment and banishment. 

**Tin Note**: Dark and earthy, dried fruit, a little Virginia woodsy scent, all the normal signs of a VaPer... but there is that floral and sweet undertone, the Katerini of course, and the Cavendish. On occasion, there is a musty, wet smell of... something. Something elusive, oily, moving in the periphery, if a scent could do this.

**Taste**: This blend is easily in perique-light VaPer territory, with some extra sweetness. The Katerini really stands out; if you're familiar with its strangely olive oil and floral quality, you'll find it quickly in Miskatonic Mixture. It plays well with the Virginia, as Orientals tend, the Cavendish does fill out the body a bit, and the perique is just present enough to give it that earthen, dried fruit softness somewhere deep in the blend. I have on occasion wished for a VaPer which could showcase a bit of Katerini or some similar Oriental, and this is probably what I was looking for. It does develop across the bowl into something a bit more spicy, as Orientals and VaPers like to do, but it's never punchy or overwhelming, and it is nuanced from start to finish. If I've not found some way to deal with the "visitor" that seems intent on emerging from the tin by the time I've exhausted the tobacco, then at least I will greet the thing with a satisfied piping experience. I'm sure it will care.

**Smokability**: Requires some drying. It does retain moisture well, especially when that... visitor... half emerges from it. This time that I let it dry before loading another bowl, I think it is the time in which it is unsmoked that the visitor finds the veils between our worlds most thin. Fortunately, once properly dried, a pipe full will burn steadily and slowly, almost always pleasantly down to the bottom of the bowl.

**Room note**: Standard VaPer. Not especially obnoxious, but it did draw a few dirty looks from the librarian who I thought should have a greater taste for the offensive.

**Nicotine**: A little lite for my tastes, but sure for the best, as nicotine-induced drowsiness would do me and perhaps Arkham little good tonight.

**Thoughts**: This is all around a good blend. Katerini is a interesting leaf, and Miskatonic Mixture uses it wisely to create special blend. This could easily be an all day smoke, as well it *must* be, for my purposes. It will take some time to properly construct and consecrate the Sigil of the Watcher, but the stars favor me tonight, perhaps as much as they've cursed me. I will continue to smoke this blend through the night, piping enjoyably and inexorably toward my confrontation with the creature that steadily makes itself more known to our world.

**Does it grape?** No. 

**Rating**: 4/5

RegicideBrown: Bravo! I'll ponder it when I get a chance to smoke my own tin (whenever that is - it's been taunting me from my shelf as I wait for the temperature to at least get above freezing).
--
chewsyourownadv: Bah. Throw on the thermal underwear and out there.
--
RegicideBrown: I have brought shame upon not only myself, but this whole subreddit. I'll go say 15 Hail Esotericas as penance. 
--
chewsyourownadv: > I'll go say 15 Hail Esotericas as ~~penance~~ Penzance.

Fixed.

Srsly though, I like having a morning walk and smoke, and have enjoyed a bit Miskatonic in subzero temps. I think it holds up to the cold alright.

PerdomoHabano: I really have to open my tin. I bought one each of the four Lovecraft-inspired blends when they came out simply because I love the names and tin art, but I'm sure they are good smokes too!

Amator: Guilty. Even if I hate the blends, I plan on repurposing the tins to hold pieces for [Arkham Horror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror)
