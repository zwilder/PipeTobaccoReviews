Tobacco Review: Dark Star

Review # 58

**Blend Name:** McClelland Dark Star

**Description on Tin:** Years before tinning, Dark Star begins as a bright, sugary top-grade Virginia and Carolina leaf. Through careful aging, pressing and stoving, it becomes rich, cool, and dark with a seductively spicy aroma and complex flavor.
 
**Leaf:** Black flake with almost no variation, about half broken, half fairly uniform. Practically dripping when you first open up the tin.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Heinz 57, Worcestershire sauce, mushrooms, earthy, chocolate.
 
**Taste:** Sharp, white vinegar and salt. Very faintly lemon and oranges. A touch of sweetness, but no candy here. Whataburger Ketchup. Another McClelland blend where the tin note actually comes through on the taste. For many that is a nightmare, but for me, it is exactly what I want. Something floral about it, rose petals. Umami – soy sauce and cream. Slowly grows plummy, a dark fruity-savoury flavor that you taste from the beginning, but it takes you awhile to sense it. The sweetness ticks up, but really tends more towards the savoury flavours, fish sauce. Little bursts of earth, outright dirt. The name is right on this is about the *darkest* Virginia I have ever tasted. The vinegar comes back. There is nary a hint of citrus about the sharp taste here, just vinegar and pepper, like a North Carolina White Vinegar barbeque sauce. Maybe that is overly specific. 

**Nicotine:** Fairly low.

**Smokability:** Oh my. I would have to look into the reason – or maybe a professional can explain it to me – but these super dark flakes, Dark Star, Blackwoods, and Full Virginia Flake – are all wet in the tin, hell to dry, prone to extinguish themselves even when crispy. I did the same thing as Blackwoods, opened the tin and left the lid off for a few weeks before I tried smoking it. Even after that, it was pretty ugly. I thought it was too wet, so I did the wet paper towel trick. And in a day, it was wet again. This stuff can hold some moisture. So I dried it out again, just a bowl this time, before the review. It performed a bit better, but still kind of a chore.
 
**Room Note:** Mild, tobacco, a bit of vinegar. 

**Thoughts:** I am pretty confident this was specifically made to replicate or rival Full Virginia Flake. It is a super dark flake with a limited range of flavors, a bit less fruity and a bit more savoury, but very, very close. Sometimes I prefer this one, sometimes FVF. Sometime I need to do a blind taste test to see if I can even tell the difference. So the next time Samuel Gawith has production issues – or even more terrifying to contemplate, their merger with G&H Co. means all the SG products will also be poisoned by Lakeland residue, this is a ready made substitution.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Full Virginia Flake, Blackwoods

**Summary:** A vinegar-plummy-savoury Full Virginia Flake doppelganger.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
crimsonrat: I absolutely could not get this lit or to stay lit, and I am a huge FVF fan. 

You raise a good point about the lakeland flavoring. I wonder what the chances are it will be tainted with it? Anyone tried the new stuff yet?
--
xDemagog: We would've seen complaints cropping up here in England if there was any cross pollination of Lakeland. I haven't tasted any difference from what I've smoked. 
--
crimsonrat: I picture it being like one of those videos of parliament where they're yelling. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Good to know. I found it was a problem with GH&CO but that SG had their process clean. I am still afraid from fallout from the merger.
--
====================================
LegesAequitas: Thanks for the review! I just popped open one of my tins a few days ago and have been drying out a few flakes. I may write up a review too once I give it a few smokes.
--
antiwittgenstein: Please do - we need more reviews on this sub, competing ones too as everyone's experience is somewhat to completely different.
--
LegesAequitas: Sounds good. I've been pretty quiet on here for a few months; I need to get on Reddit more. I've just had one smoke so far and I definitely had a different experience to yours, or just about anyone else I think.
--
====================================
None: I dry mine out all the way and have no problem with relights.
--
antiwittgenstein: I was able to hit that magic point with Blackwoods, but not this tin. I went a bit too far I think. Oh well. I have a feeling this isn't gone be the only tin of this I ever smoke, so I will get another chance at some point.
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: Color me confused. I thoroughly enjoyed Dark Star but thought FVF was bland by comparison.
--
antiwittgenstein: Dark is probably a bit sharper, but much of the rest seemed to be in the same vein. Allow for differences in preparation, pipes, humidity, age, palate, and the Coriolis effect.
