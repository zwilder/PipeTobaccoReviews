[Review] GL Pease The Virginia Cream

Blend Name: GL Pease The Virginia Cream

Description on Tin: Distinctively delicious! G.L. Pease seasons fine red and golden flue-cured Virginia tobaccos with rare condimental leaf, enhancing the result with a subtle vanilla/bourbon topping that is never overbearing. Rare for a blend of its genre, The Virginia Cream delivers on its aromatic promise from the first puff to the bottom of the bowl, while leaving the pipe clean and free of phantom flavors. An all-American blend ideal for Virginia fanciers craving something a little sweeter.
Leaf: Tan and mocha ribbons with large chunks of black curley leaf.  The occasional stem and large leaf.

 Tin Aroma: Sweet gourmand vanilla potpourri.  This has more of a floral or food vanilla rather than air freshner.  Very sweet.  

Taste:  The topping will never be stronger than the first puff.  TVC starts off with a heavy blast of cream soda and then the raw taste of tobacco comes thorugh.  Pepper, spice, sweet breads, sour burley, then the topping.   Ive been smoking more C+D blends lately and have come to appreciate the bolder taste their tobacco has.  Each component comes through sharply but as a whole the blend is well mixed.  At times the sweet almost bready Virginias come through only to catch a taste of the floral dark fired or the peppery perique.  The perique in this blend is not the figgy/raisin and chocolate like Anniversary Kake; it’s more of a sharp spicy taste like General Tso’s chicken or American Spirit perique blend cigarettes.  Sometimes a mustiness will show up.   The burley comes in heavily in the beginning much like 3 Friars.  At times it is nutty and sour, other times a bit ashy.  By midbowl a hint of chocolate comes through.  The retrohale brings out some hot pepper and the oaky component of the bourbon.  The dark fired must be used very sparingly in this blend because it only pops up once in a while.  It’s the same umami taste that can be found in Jackknife Plug, think French onion soup and sautéed onions and mushrooms.  It’s quite the treat to taste how these all play together.  The overall taste reminds me of how YSL’s Opium cologne smells; schezwan pepper and vanilla.

Nicotine: On the heavy side of medium.  I def feel this one by mid bowl and rarely make it through a bowl without setting it down for a bit.

Smokability: Play around with your drying time here.  Overnight crispy will yield a dry creamy smoke that I prefer over a 10-15 minute drying time.
 
Room Note: My wife doesn’t care if I smoke in the house but this one had her turn to me and remark that I can smoke this one anytime as it smells like a Yankee candle.

Thoughts:  I find myself reaching for this blend when I want something with a bit more oomph and to challenge myself to discern the difference between the perique and the dark fired, especially on the retrohale.  (It’s hard as they are both spicy.)  
  I homebrewed several beers last year that were aged on French oak.  French oak has a very distinct and raw taste to it unlike white oak which bourbon is traditionally aged on.  The bourbon topping in combination with the burley lends this distinct raw taste to the blend instead of the normal mellow (vanilla/cinnamon/brownsugar) oak that bourbon has.  Occasionally I’ll catch a hint of “true bourbon” but it’s so fleeting that it is a nice surprise when it does appear.
 Overall the blend is quite spicy and I think that’s the reason it’s not rated higher than it is.  Don’t forget that this is a VaPer with burley, Kentucky, and a sweet topping instead of a light aromatic.

Full disclosure: I left this tin in the car for 2 days and the lid was not on all the way so the tin has been rehydrated with distilled water.  This has led to the aromatic topping tasting slightly less intense than when I first opened it.
 
Similar Tobaccos: c+D Three Friars, Autumn Evening

Summary: A spicy and sweet blend that is very complex and well done.

My Background: Smoked cigars on and off for a few years and have been catching up on the world of pipe tobaccos for 2 years.  Known to sneak the occasional cigarette in years past.

I taste and smell in color and this blend has tan, red, and white.

Ratings:  5/5 for complexity 3.5/5 for taste.

mugwump867: Nice review.  I tried this yesterday after setting it aside for a few months and I can tell it's starting to mellow and meld a bit.  I'm enjoying it more than when it was fresh out of the tin but it still packs more nicotine than I care for.  It should get really good after a few years when that greenness wears off the tobacco.
--
misterzipp0: Thanks. I was hesitant to say "heavy" on the nicotine because I know there's other blends that eclipse it but it does pack a wallop.

====================================
SupraMario: I have mine still sitting as I tried a few bowls and just didnt care for it. I'm hoping letting it rest will give it what I want. Nice review though.

====================================
joshoowah: Interesting read. While I found it to be "okay" straight out of the tin, it is a bit unrefined. I imagine some age would do wonders for this blend. I finished my tin a while back and I doubt I'll order any more than the two tins that I bought.

====================================
TheNutPair: Great review!  This stuff has become my daily smoke as of late.

====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Thanks for the review! I'll add this one to the wish list.

====================================
Doc_Hooligan: I have a tin that's been sitting for a few months. My question is this: when I decide to smoke it, should I try it in my pipe for aromatics or the one I use for Virginias? I don't want to ghost my VA pipe, but I'm not sure I'd get the full flavor with my aro pipe due to ghosting. 
--
misterzipp0: The topping won't ghost the Va pipe, the dark fired will add its own flair but nothing that won't come out quickly.

antiwittgenstein: Nice review!

How long did you have the tin before you cracked it open? Like some other commenters I found this stuff to be, lets say not up to C&D snuff when fresh off the truck.
--
misterzipp0: Thanks! Your reviews pushed me to start doing my own.  My tin was only a few months old so no aging as far as I'm concerned.  I've got an original release tin aging for comparison at some point.

I need to get some in a jar to smooth it out but it's so complex at the moment that I've been having a lot of fun with it.
--
antiwittgenstein: Well keep em coming. It is always nice to hear different voices on the sub, especially about the same blends. Come back and tell us what it is like as it ages. I was going to do that myself but I end up giving away what I had left. It is ambitious blend and am I sure it has a good following now.
