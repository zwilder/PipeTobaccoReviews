My belated Powdered Toast Man Review

I am really sorry I am late with this. I wanted to smoke this more than once and life has been crazy. Still. Better late than never.

For me the 'vial note' was interesting. I picked up a hint of chocolate, and definitely some of the buttered toast aroma. There was also a 'nutty' scent that I couldn't quite place (almond?)

The truck note (where I do a lot of my testing) was quite good. I definitely tasted more of the almond/nut flavor (hazelnut?) and some of the cinnamon came out more. The chocolate I detected in the tin note was not found in my smokes.

There was some tongue burn, but I freely admit to being a fast smoker and I usually do that to myself. There was a pleasant retrohale where I could really pick up on the butter toast.

I am not a huge aromatic fan, and I know what I like with the blends I do (McLelland TQ is my favorite aro). I think this would definitely go in the rotation and thanks for the sample.!

Highball2814: I know but the kindness was sent to me many weeks ago. Lol.

boomermax: I'm right there with you.  Mine has been sitting as well.  We've been misplaced out of our apartment waiting repair of a sewer line where they have to come and Jack hammer out our floor.

Haven't touched my pipes in over 5 weeks.  With the heat and the mosquitoes and not having my spot to sit down it has been a nightmare.

p4ttythep3rf3ct: Don't feel bad.  My sample is still awaiting patiently for my review, all jarred up.  I haven't found a good time to sit back and fully appreciate a smoke lately, but when I do, PTM is that smoke.  That said, my wife opened up the jar two days ago, took a whiff, and stated 'This is now mine,' so I should probably get cracking!
