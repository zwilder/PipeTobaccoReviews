briarandvine: Glad to see you got your tin! Can't wait to see what I get for mine!

====================================
facestab: Interesting that you were able to detect the latakia. The reviews on this blend are all-over the place taste-wise.

Chrisj2001: I love lat so I'm like a mother hearing her baby's cry in a crowd when it comes to identifying it. But you're correct in that it's not a heavy-handed portion of it. It's a different blend. Almost perfumed instead of cased.

ChefPD: I was waiting for this to pop on tobaccoreviews.com. Posted my review (shortened version) as well.
