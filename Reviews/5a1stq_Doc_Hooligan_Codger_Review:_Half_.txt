Codger Review: Half and Half
By: Doc_Hooligan
---
A few months back, I (half-jokingly) suggested doing some reviews of codger tobaccos. Since /u/mcguire took up the mantle and posted his own [reviews of a few codger blends](https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/5558ja/no_thursday_for_old_codgers/?st=iuvio7nl&sh=a739e50c), I figured it was only fair for me to post one. Here's my review of Half and Half:

**Pipe**: 363 Pipes squat tomato (briar)

**Pouch Note**: Artificial. Chemical. Sweet. Kind of like Twizzlers.

**Loading**: Since it's a codger tobacco, I felt it was only right to use the codger scoop method of loading.

**Char light**: Quick and easy. Definitely noticed the topping as well as the nutty flavor of the burley.

**True light**: Also quick and easy. Topping flavor much less noticeable.

**Room note**: Unknown (smoked it outdoors)

**The smoke**: The topping flavor was little more than a whisper after about a minute or two, and thank goodness for that. I was more than a little bit leery of even trying this one after opening the pouch and smelling it. 

Flavor is fairly ho-hum. Not a whole lot to say other than it's definitely burley-based. Slightly cigarette-like and not terribly complex. Still getting some flavor of the topping on retrohale, but it's subdued enough that it actually complements the tobacco. Flavor seems to improve as the bowl progresses. Also seems to burn pretty quickly, although that could be partially due to packing method. 

A sniff of the bowl (since I'm outside and can't really discern a room note) reminds me of a musty attic or granddad's workshop. Specifically reminiscent of woodworking, like cutting or sanding hardwoods (walnut or oak, in particular). 

Halfway point and the flavor is starting to change. Sweetness has declined considerably and left more of a woody, earthy flavor. Almost makes me wonder if I'm still tasting tobacco or if the bowl is burning and I'm actually smoking wood, although the bowl has remained reasonably cool. No gurgle or tongue bite at all. Still smells nutty and woody in the bowl.

3/4 of the way in and decided to push it to see if it will bite. Puffing like a freight train and still no bite. Surprisingly, I think the flavor has improved a bit by puffing more aggressively.

Coming to the end of the bowl, I got a little carried away with my aggressive puffing and ended up sucking a hot ember down the stem. That's my cue to call it a day. 

**Overall**: MUCH better than I expected. I guess there's a good reason this one has been around as long as it has. It's inexpensive, readily available, and a pretty decent smoke for the money. Burns quickly, so it's good for a short smoking session. Flavor is decent, and while it's nothing special, it's not bad at all. I've had far worse smokes from much more expensive tobaccos (although that could be partially due to getting better at packing and smoking, rather than just the tobacco). Required only one relight, and no tongue bite (tongue burn from a hot ember, yes, but still no bite.)

I'd give this one a solid three stars out of four. 
====================================
Unidentified_Remains: Grandpa smoked half & half his entire life. I always keep a pouch around, just for the nostalgia. One whiff of it, and I'm 10, sitting at the kitchen table next to him, listening to Bob Ueker (sp?) calling the Brewers game.

Doc_Hooligan: Ii don't have any kind of nostalgia attached to any pipe tobaccos, but this one did remind me of my granddad's workshop, even though he wasn't a pipe smoker (or any kind of smoker, for that matter). Odd how that worked out, I think.

Zapotecorum: Thanks for the review!

half and half burned my mouth for some reason (not typical tongue bite). i think i'm somewhat allergic to something in the topping. I thought it was a decent tobacco though. Still like Carter Hall the most of the drug store tobaccos

poops_in_public: Someone else on here (blenheim iirc) commented that certain tobacco strains, usually virginia, have a chemical reaction for some people that causes a burning sensation dissimilar from tongue bite. I seem to fall into that category with virginias.

Doc_Hooligan: I haven't tried Carter Hall yet, but I see it gets quite a bit of love on here. I've only really tried Captain Black and (now) Half and Half, as far as drug store tobaccos go. Thankfully, I have a pretty good stockpile of various tobaccos cellared, but at least I know that if I'm in a pinch and need to pick up some pipe tobacco, Half and Half isn't bad. Carter Hall will probably be my next codger blend purchase.

mcguire: Twizzlers, you say?

> Coming to the end of the bowl, I got a little carried away with my aggressive puffing and ended up sucking a hot ember down the stem.

I did that the other day. I wasn't even puffing very hard, just getting close to the bottom of the bowl. Thought it was going to raise a blister for a while.

No one ever warned me I could set my bridgework on fire...
--
Doc_Hooligan: Yep. Twizzlers. Not sure why, but that's what came to mind when I opened the pouch and took a big whiff.

antiwittgenstein: Nice review! If anything the Codger blends are the ones that need to be reviewed the most, so that everyone has a good feel for what is and isn't good and is stuck with what is at the drug store out in the wilderness. Keep em coming.
