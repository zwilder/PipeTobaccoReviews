Three Nuns: an actual review this time

As some of you may remember, my first tin of the new Three Nuns didn't go so well:
http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/1qx3sn/the_new_three_nuns_a_review/   

Anyway I've got my replacement tin and tried a few bowls.
I actually already posted a review of this thinking it was a vaper blend before /u/soymilkisgood pointed out it's actually flavored with Kentucky dark fired, not perique.  Which explains a lot for why I couldn't get a handle on smoking it properly.  I was going at it thinking it was a perique blend, but couldn't understand why I couldn't get the flavor to shine through- it just goes to show, if you go into something expecting a certain something to be there, you'll completely miss what IS there. 

Background: I've been a vaper flake/full virginia flake smoker for about 12 years, and can't stand latakia.  If your favorite blends are S.G. FVF and McClelland 2015 Virginia perique flake, this review's for you. 

Tin notes: 
Coins are rough cut, similar to P.S. Luxury Curly Cut.  Tobacco is very very dry- almost crispy- exactly the way I like flakes (crumbly when you touch them).  This one is noticeably mold free :)
The aroma is very earthy and woody- cedar.  A second sniff after you've started puffing is a nose full of musk.. a good sign.  I initially thought this was perique but it's the dark fired shining through.

Smoking notes:
The first little bit is a woody oaky flavor.  Midway it takes on a woody virginia flavor- much like Virginia Woods- with a strong dark undertone from the Kentucky.  Very nice but you have to smoke it carefully to appreciate the nuances.  This tin declares it was packed in March- so 8 months old.  I think this blend needs a good year or more of aging to calm down and be consistent, much like Escudo. 

Towards the end the dark fired comes out full force, the woody flavor is gone.  Reminiscent of HH Old Dark Fired.  The ash on top makes it a bit acrid and needs to be carefully knocked out.  That's a sign of a blend that could use some age.   Because it comes so dry, the ash is super fine grey, so it's not hard. 

(Edit: this bit may not be true- I could only find that fermented flavor I was looking for in a narrow pipe, I shall have to try again in wider pipes to appreciate it for what it is)

*A funny note that I've never really run into before- this blend is very temperamental with different pipes.  The flavors don't come out so well in wide chambered bowls- I've had three mediocre bowls, and one fantastic one in a tall, narrow chambered pipe.*

Overall- a great woody smoke.   I'll buy a half dozen tins and lay them down for a few years, and I'll be damn sure to check the seals.  If you like Virginia Woods, or dark flakes, this one's for you.

What really threw me off to start with is how it has the same tangy fermented nuances of perique.   The flavor is so close it fooled me even with a decade of perique addiction.  Smoking it without sitting there constantly looking for perique is the way to go lol- you can appreciate the balance of virginias.

crimsonrat: You and I have similar tastes,  and I have 3 tins in the closet aging now.

MetalEd: Given that neither of us want our Cairo or nightcap, yep. :)

HellOnAStick: after reading this, and knowing that you've been smoking virginas for a long time...what do you think of mcclelland's line? I've been slowly working my way through their matured Va's, i have some older and some very young tins....would you say that SG or another blender has more quality, or better blending tactics?

MetalEd: I love McClellands.  They are not better or worse than Sam Gawith, just different. 

McClellands is the king of red virginia, and has the most use of perique.  All their blends are aged in tin and in processing, which makes all the difference and is a hallmark of quality.  (That's the "ketchup" smell when you open them.  It's fermenting tobacco, and it airs out. )

Sam Gawith has traditional methods and sources, and sticks to producing a quality product even when it means they can't meet demand.  They're still using 200 year old wood presses to make their flakes!  There is a good reason that FVF is the benchmark for a good full virginia flake, it's the best (IMHO).  I only really smoke FVF, BBF, and SJF from them, don't really care for their other blends.  Medium virginia flake is a horrible abomination. .. not sure what happened there. 

Keep tasting!  My favorite blends are:
FVF

2015

Marlin Flake (Rattrays)

SJF

Christmas Cheer

2010

Luxury navy flake (Stokkebye.  This needs two years aging minimum)

BBF

Blackwoods flake

St.  James woods

Kendal Cream Flake
Escudo

As you can see. ... 10/12 from McClellands/SG.  Hope that helps.

HellOnAStick: Yes, i have really grown tired reading all the reviews on McC blends where people claim that the sour/vinegary smell is from something other than fermenting tobacco. I have some rather aged marlin flake...i should break that open this winter, but I've dedicated myself to cleaning up all the other open tins that clutter my table....(im a compulsive git.) 
I'm really interested in the navy flakes and since i've liked just about every VaPer that I've smoked, i'll have to do the deed and buy some escudo. I'll have to give the FVF its due as well. might dive into a 500g pack just for the hell of it and see if I can age it for 5, 10 and 20 years. Thank you for your indepth answer. I'm always out for more information!

MetalEd: How many tins do you have open generally? 

I count 12 beside me plus 3 pouches. 
I always tell myself I'm going to smoke up all the open stuff before I open another. . But then I think I'd be stuck smoking one thing all the time. 

Plus I really wanna crack that Christmas cheer 08...

wza: I opened up the '08 this year at it's fantastic--sweet and smooth as Dark Star but with more depth and complexity.
--
HellOnAStick: I usually try to keep it to 5 tins, and i have lots of mason jars that I can steal from. at the moment, however, i'm looking at 12 open tins as well. I MUST have restraint! lol. mainly my issue is that I've got so many similar things open, (i went on a VA tasting spree some months ago) and some of the flakes/blends i don't want to jar or age any further...so im sort of stuck smoking them, unless i want to throw them out. (not gonna do it) I've smoked some 20'11 this year, last year i think it was 07 or 06 christmas cheer. I do have a can of '98 that would have just turned 15, but I think I'd like to open that in another 5 years just to see. has anyone tried the '13 yet this year? same as always?
