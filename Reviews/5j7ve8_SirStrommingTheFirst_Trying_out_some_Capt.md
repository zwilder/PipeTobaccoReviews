DWMoose83: I too would love to hear your opinion, since I'm a fan of Royal.

SirStrommingTheFirst: Basically, a super bland aro. Really heavily cased with super fake vanilla taste. 

Spend the extra cash and get yourself some Mac Baren Vanilla Cream... unless you live in Calgary like me. Then try to order it online
--
====================================
Kal-ElofKrypton: I think I have that same pipe. Mine is a basket labeled "Capri".
--
SirStrommingTheFirst: Same. A Capri bulldog basket pipe that I got for about 30 bucks. Smokes great for aros, so I dedicated it for that.

But a majority of the cake on it is from Peterson Luxury Blend.
--
Kal-ElofKrypton: I dedicated mine to aro's too. I actually brought it to work for the occasional smoke break that I get. Here, I wouldn't want to smoke much beyond an aro... Maybe some FMC, but that's about as strong as I'd go.
