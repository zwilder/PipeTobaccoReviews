[Review] Rattrays "Marlin Flake"
By: butterspread

After a long time of smoking mostly the same rotation of blends, I decided to try something new. 

I was in Glasgow and popped into Robert Graham to see what I can get. As I mentioned in my previous post, their stock of tobacco was somewhat reduced. I chose Marlin Flake in a nice square 50g tin. 


I'm not gonna lie to you, I popped that tin open immediately after leaving the shop to have a whiff of that tin note. It was delightful. Nice, very uniform medium thick flakes, oozing sweetness and fruitiness with slight notes of cocoa. I knew right there that I'm in for a treat. 


Fast forward to the afternoon. I laid out two flakes on a piece of paper and let them sit for a couple of hours. I then broke them up and rubbed out rather finely. At this point the moisture level was perfect. No trouble at all. 


Mug of tea, pipe in my hand, away I went to my shed. 


Someone once used an expression to describe the ease with which the tobacco took to the flame as their wife took to the sugar. That's exactly it. Light as a dream. 


The flavour is ‘Oh my God of Sweet Virginias”. This is a bliss. On par with Germain's Brown Flake. 


I'm in the bottom one third of my Falcon billiard bowl and I'm yet to see any sign of a bite. Smokes cool and dry with no issues whatsoever. I'm not too good in distinguishing the component tobaccos but Virginias are playing in the foreground with the Perique will in the background. I can still detect those cocoa notes I smelled from the tin. 


I'm not expecting any relights at all and can already say after one bowl that I will be buying more. If you can get your hands on this, then go and grab a few tins straight away. 


I hope you enjoyed my first attempt at a proper review. Next one will be Royal Yacht.

brainskan13: I have 2 100g tins in my cellar. I haven't tried it yet, but look forward with a anticipation. Your review is making it harder to wait. :-)

antiwittgenstein: Thanks for taking the time to review this. It has been on my radar a long time, and as an inveterate Virginia man, I owe it to myself to try it soon. Keep the reviews coming.
