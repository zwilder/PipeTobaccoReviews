Review: Mac Baren Virginia No. 1
By: soymilkisgood

**Blend Name:** Mac Baren Virginia No. 1

**Tin Description:** Golden Sweet Pipe Tobacco. A ready rubbed tobacco, manufactured from a selection of choice, ripe Virginia tobaccos, which gives Virginia No.1 a mild, sweet smoke.

**Leaf:** Virginia

**Appearance:** Fully rubbed out flake. Light to light medium color.

**Tin Aroma:** A nice candy-like sweetness with grassy and hay notes in the background. Very pleasant, though I can’t quite put my finger on what the top flavor is. It’s just a vague fruity note.

**Taste:** A good light Virginia taste with some sweeter notes that are evident from the topping. Not very much pure tobacco taste, but I didn’t expect that from the tin note. It’s certainly a rubbed out, quality non-descript Virginia to which the top note/casing adds a bit of glossy sheen. Like a caramelization, almost. Not a ton of depth of flavor, but it is consistent in its pleasant taste and retrohale. Something I could see myself smoking a couple bowls of in one sitting because it’s so easy to smoke.

**Strength and Nicotine:** Not very strong, but not totally absent. Maybe my tolerance is getting to be a little high, I don’t know. But it’s just ever so slightly south of an enjoyable strength for me. Someone with a lower nicotine tolerance could see this as ideal, I think.

**Smokeability:** Eminently smokeable, with a variety of pleasant flavors that meld well together. Will not offend your palate in any way. In that regard it’s not particularly exciting per se, but it is something I could see myself reaching for on occasion. Will definitely make your guests happy as well!

**Room Note:** Pleasant room note with the same sweetness and vague grassy/hay like qualities from the smoke. Not too artificial but not too strong. A good middle ground. 

**Thoughts:** A solid lightly topped Virginia that would be a nice cross-over blend for someone who likes aromatics but maybe wants a little bit more tobacco flavor in their blends. That is not my personal favorite profile so I’m not going out to buy ten tins of this, but I could see how an aromatic smoker would enjoy this blend. Even non-aromatic smokers could see this enter into their rotation on occasion with no issue.

**Recommend to:** An aromatic smoker, a non-aromatic smoker who would like something sweeter for themselves or their guests. Nicotine addicts need not apply.

**Summary:** A nice aromatic Virginia blend that pleases the palate with sweet flavors of candy and fruit, but not in a sickening way. Something for everyone to enjoy is present in this blend (well, except Latakia, but that’s neither here nor there). Enjoyable and nonoffensive, if not particularly special or complex in flavor profile.

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a few months ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and have been receiving gratis Sutliff products in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this is one of many that I'll be doing as part of the program.

xDemagog: Did it bite for you at all?
--
soymilkisgood: A tiny bit but not terribly. Not enough that I thought would warrant a mention. 
--
jarvis400: I was expecting at least a little nippy experience reported, but no. 

Some people don't have any problems but I personally can't handle MacB #1 at all. And yes, I smoke slow.
--
xDemagog: Normally MacBaren blends scorch my tongue but this one I've always really enjoyed. 
--
MetalEd: Same.  After a decade of smoking flakes, a bowl of VA1 bites the hell out of me. 

Greg Pease attempted to do a community study on this topic to try to determine what might be related to tongue bite, specifically mouth chemistry.  The chain of replies on smokersforums was nothing short of a debacle.

Heh, I can believe that. 

What really annoys me is whenever the MacBite phenomenon comes up there will always be people, who have no adverse reaction  to MacB tobaccos, claim that it's really my poor technique that causes the bite. Some even have a mad theory that the whole thing is some sort of mass delusion, that the bite is actually not there at all. "I don't experience it -- therefore it doesn't exist."

I have a suspicion that the cause is in something Mac Baren adds in most of their blends; either a sweetener, or a humectant. Sorbitol, maybe. I have no problems with their HH line, which is supposed to be more natural.

THIS.  I always preface my MacTonguebiteBitching with "I've been smoking a pipe for a decade and my technique is fucking fine, TYVM.

>I have a suspicion that the cause is in something Mac Baren adds in most of their blends; either a sweetener, or a humectant. Sorbitol, maybe. I have no problems with their HH line, which is supposed to be more natural.

I have NO idea why some people are immune.  My guess is that folks who smoked cased aromatics regularly are immune to this particular chemical.  But I can tell it's there with almost every MacB blend - you can literally see the glossiness.

I find their HH a bit harsh if smoked young, but no bite issues unless it's quite damp.

th3st: Great review Smig!

MetalEd: Was it an aged tin? 
I can't smoke it less than a year old without a shotglass and bottle of Biotene handy. 
--
soymilkisgood: I don't think so. If anything it was maybe a year old. I don't remember to be honest. Don't have the tin in front of me.

====================================
None: The only MacBaren product that doesn't bite me like a rabid dog is Honey & Chocolate.
