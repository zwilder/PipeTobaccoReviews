Review # 65

**Blend Name:** Hearth and Home Classic Burley Kake
 
**Description on Tin:** Classic Burley Kake is a blend that pays homage to old-time Burley flakes and cakes. Using Tennessee and Kentucky Burleys, ranging from lighter white to darker mahogany, and a bit of matured red Virginia, this sliced cake tobacco is a traditional American-style blend. We start with four different types of Burley, the aforementioned Tennessee and Kentucky, plus two different premium white Burleys. Then we add a red Virginia for a maple-like sweetness. The addition of cocoa, rum and a hint of anise completes the comforting flavor and room note. The aroma is mellow and pleasant, and the taste is lightly sweet with a large volume of smoke. Hearken back to a simpler time when the sight of a pipe in someone’s mouth while walking down the street was common, and the scent of pipe tobacco was everywhere. Give Classic Burley Kake a try and go back in time

**Leaf:** Uniform brown, half short brown flake, half little (0.75” x 0.25” x 0.25” or 18 mm x 12 mm x 12 mm) chunks o cakey goodness.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisin bran. Honey. Molasses. Hints of sulphur and burnt rubber.

**Taste:** Classic burley indeed. Nutty and bready. A bit sweet, sweeter than the other burley blends I have had thus far for sure. Some Virginia tang is there, a citrus-vinegar that is still rather light, but seems pronounced in the room note as I exhale. A bit of spice is in there. Then the cocoa comes, powdered hot chocolate kind of cocoa. Maybe a bit of vanilla in there too. This really bends the boundary between aromatic and burley blend. Sometimes the sweetness feels it is from casing, sometimes it seems natural, from the Virginia. After all the elements present themselves, it is pretty consistent for the remainder of a bowl. However the taller the bowl the more time the Virginias have to build and develop, so if you do give it time (or DGT) you will see the bread and cocoa dim away under a growing fruity sweetness till you can hardly remember this stuff is called burley cake.

**Nicotine:** Medium light. So very mild for a burley, substantial for an aromatic.

**Smokability:** Very easy with a bit of drying time.
 
**Room Note:** Nutty, warm tobacco, cocoa. Good for a burley, bad for an aromatic.

**Thoughts:** Another tobacco that spans two worlds, this time a burley based blend with an aromatic. There are plenty of great natural flavors from this stuff, both from the burley and the Virginia, but the casing is rather noticeable. I had a bit of trouble pinning this one down. Sometimes I would have a very good bowl of it where everything would sing just right, then a few days later it would be flat, or worse, bitter. So watch out for inconsistencies.

I’ve yet to do this but my brother thinks this stuff is great to give a milquetoast aromatic some strength.
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** Prince Albert, Erin Go Bragh, Carter Hall
 
**Summary:** A slightly sweet, slightly aromatic version of Prince Albert.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

carnesy: I found I wasn't getting the flavors from this until I let the smoke rest in my mouth for a few seconds after each draw. Doing so caused the smoke to build a "film" (that's the best way I can describe it anyway) that coated the inside of my mouth as I smoked and that's where the flavors came from, especially the top note flavors. If you're drinking anything as you smoke this it washes the film off and you lose the flavors. Sadly the filmy feeling was really noticeable (ie annoying) to me so I was frequently washing my mouth with water or coffee as I smoked most of the time. Not buying another tin.

raizel_234: I love this stuff. For me its the best of both worlds, aromatic enough to pleasing but enough tobacco flavor to remind me i'm smoking a pipe.
