[Review] STC - Bengal Flake
By: crimblade
---
**Blend Name:** Bengal Slice

**Description on Tin:** A unique latakia-based crumble cake made with yellow and black Virginias, some of the most delectable Orientals available and a touch of unflavored black cavendish.

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish, Latakia, Oriental/Turkish, Virginia. Krumble Kake that is sliced into bars that crumble very easily. Very dark and rich.

**Tin Aroma:** Dark and smokey. Sweet Licorice.  Slightly sour.

**Taste:** Not as dark as the smell might have initially implied. The licorice topnote is present fitfully and mostly blends into the flavor of the tobaccos. A slight sweetness to the smokey flavors of the Latakia. The Orientals and Virginias don't make their presence known other than softening the heavy latakia. It's been very nicely balanced so that it doesn't become overwhelming.

**Smokability:** It smokes well right out of the tin. Drying helps keep it from going out but really I didn't have any problems with it without drying, relighting doesn't really bother me much. It's super easy to prepare, rubbing it out has never been so easy, it's almost too easy, it's over before you know it. The Krumble Kake is sliced but it's a thick enough flake that rubbing it out doesn't cause you to end up with a fine powder like some cube cut blends seem to try to achieve, so while you may get a shot of tobacco on the first few puffs it won't be a constant throughout the smoke. It's easy enough to get some bigger pieces on the bottom.

**Room Note:** Like a raging, smokey, incensed campfire, only dialed back slightly. 

**Thoughts:** The first blend I truly enjoyed as a Pipe Smoker was Frog Mortons Cellar, it was when I first smoked that blend that I first had my "Ah-ha, so that's what this about." moment. Since then I've delved far and wide into the world of pipe smoking. While I may love my Va/Pers now as well as the Lakeland blends there's always a soft place in my heart for English's especially as the season grows cold. So I was pleasantly surprised when I first popped a tin of Bengal Slice close to a year ago and found again that delightful english smoke with a hint of flavor much like the presentation of FMC. Now don't take this wrong, Bengal Slice is not the same as FMC, the top notes alone differentiate them, oh sorry the top note of Bengal Slice versus the cubing of cellar. My point is more along the lines that here is a pleasant english with a delightful sweetness to it that gives you a little something extra. I most enjoy this blend in the evening with a hot mug of chocolate, the two pair very nicely for a nice relaxing smoke. 

I often wonder though why they call a sliced Krumble Kake a Flake, fold and stuff is impossible with it.

**Recommend to:** Latakia lovers, if you just tried FMC and love it and are looking to branch out from there. 

**Summary:** An easy smoke from start to finish. 

**Drink Pairings:**  Hot chocolate, you can't really go wrong with a good milk or oatmeal stout either.

**Final Rating:** 3.5/4

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp, Quiet Nights, and Dark Plug.

Edit: I have flakey memory.

antiwittgenstein: Aren't they supposed to show you a video in grade school to make you not feel ashamed of your inner desires?

chewsyourownadv: Bengal *Slices ;) This is a blend that will always have a place in my cellar. The topping is something I've wondered about since picking it up years ago. It's not licorice, to my mind. I hate licorice and like to think I can pick out the scent of my nemesis in any medium. The closest thing I can relate it to is frankincense.
--
crimblade: lol, I had it as Slices originally and for some reason panic changed it right before pushing it out, maybe I just like flakes too much... 

It needs to be Friday already.
--
crimblade: It definitely isn't a punch you in your face flavor of anise, I can definitely see how it could be a frankincense flavor as well. It really is quite nice. 
--
chewsyourownadv: So like I said, I really dislike licorice. Multiple people have Bengal Slices described it as licorice, and I really don't get it, so this blend has actually got me wanting to seek out blends that advertise themselves as having a licorice topping to see if I'm wrong or if **EVERYONE ELSE** is. 
--
crimblade: Hmm I'd actually be pretty curious to hear what you think about the other "anise" blends. I think the only other one I've really had is Blackpool(Esoterica), which was pretty tasty. I don't really remember getting a strong Licorice flavor from that either, and that's a blend that straight up says that's the flavoring they use for it. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Yep, and I've been tempted to get some, but that'd mean that I'm hunting down esoterica *that I suspect I won't like just to compare it to Bengal Slices*. That just seems.... Blasphemous. 
--
crimblade: There's no way I'm throwing my hat into the three ring circus that is Esoterica hunting. 

Bengal Slices are better than Blackpool.

JetLife794: Great review! I like the addition of drink pairings. Anything that pairs well with a milk or oatmeal stout immediately has my interest so I'll be adding this to my next order. 
--
crimblade: It's so good!
