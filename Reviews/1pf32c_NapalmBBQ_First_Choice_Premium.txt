First Choice Premium Blend Organic Pipe Tobacco: a review
By: NapalmBBQ
---
Let me begin with a disclaimer. I'm a cigar convert and have only been regular pipe smoker for about five months.  So my experience is minimal, and I (so far) prefer aromatics. I'm doing this solely because of my previous post that had requests for a review. 

Is it okay to call this "plain" tobacco? It's ribbon cut and smells like cigarette tobacco.  The tobacco is grown in N. Carolina and shipped to Spokane for processing and packaging. The weight printed on the package is incorrect. Its maybe a little over an ounce which I paid two dollars for. It's very very dry which causes it to smoke too hot in my MM and Savinelli straight billiard lit with wood matches. The coolest of the draws revealed some hints of vanilla. Nicotine level seems to fairly moderate with a buzz showing up around a little over halfway through the bowl. I have to say that this reminds me of smoking a cheap cigar. 

My gut says to throw an apple slice into the package ad let it sit for a week and revisit it then. As of now it's way too harsh for me; it even bit the back of my throat. 

That's the end if the review. The following is the tale of how I came across it. 

So I've been trying to find a tobacco shop that's close to home, has a decent selection, and is going to break the bank. 
This has led to me checking out all the little glorified convenience stores in my area that advertise tobacco. Most are only sell cigarettes and mid level and lower cigars. The last place I visited was called Smoke Smoke. Yeah that was a red flag, but I was curious and hopeful. The guy behind the counter was courteous, I told him I was looking for pipe tobacco. He pointed out some Captain Black, Borkum Rift, and Bull Durham. No thanks, I've paid those dues. Lastly he shows me the First Choice. A pound was $16, and what seemed to be an ounce was $2. He asked me what I was looking for so I threw out that I was looking for Dunhill Nightcap and anything by Frog Morton (I've never tried either). He asked if those were expensive, and I said they are more than most. He replied probably wouldn't be selling more expensive pipe tobacco for a while. Translate: Jan 1st he'll be up to his eyeballs in marijauna. 

Anyhoo, hope you liked the review. I'll field any questions to the best of my ability. Feel free to critique. I have a great deal to learn.

zerobpm: that's probably "roll your own" cigarette tobacco friend.

NapalmBBQ: Yeah. The package says pipe tobacco, but their website shows it being rolled.

peninsular: In recent years many roll-your-own cig tobacco brands have rebranded as "pipe" tobacco to take advantage of tax loopholes and keep the price from rising above what their consumers will pay. Source: http://www.rollyourownresource.com

NapalmBBQ: Bastards! That's excellent info to be aware of. I would like to not make more purchases like this again.

NapalmBBQ: Yeah. By those standards it's clearly cigarette tobacco. Irritating. I asked for pipe tobacco. 
I can see why they do it though. I've never smoked cigarettes, but nearly all my coworkers do, and the prices are obscene. I'm in Washington and a pack of Marlboros are over $8. In New York they're over $14! Crazy! 
Do you see pipe tobacco ever being taxed like this?
--
KubaKuba: Never. Never ever. Never ever ever. Ever.

====================================
None: Thanks for posting that. I'm always curious about stuff like this just in case it ends up being something awesome. Definitely try and hydrate it a bit, see if a cooler smoke will chase down that vanilla a little bit more. 

I hate it when I get curious and check out some of those tobacco shops. Always ends with a confused clerk not understanding why I wasn't interested in the pipe tobacco they have and a disappointed me thinking "I knew better".

====================================
None: Keep a close eye on it if you do add an apple wedge in there. That thing will get moldy very quick.
--
NapalmBBQ: Noted. I use to do that with cigars. 
--
tablinum: It's safer to put the tobacco in a bowl and stretch a moist (not dripping) paper towel over it for a few hours or overnight.  It worked brilliantly for me, and the chance of introducing mold is reduced.

====================================
None: This stuff is normally made for RYO cigarettes. It's labled pipe tobacco for some...weird reason I can't remember.


And also, I happen to like captain black! When did this subreddit turn into a holier than thou fest on tobacco?
--
NapalmBBQ: I think it's great you like Captain Black. What I'm saying is that it's not for me. 
--
poops_in_public: Love my CB too. All flavors. If smoked cool and slow it's quite delicious imo. RYO tobaccos got the worst of a tax increase to fund SCHiPS a few years ago. So many "repackaged" their product to stay at a competitive price. Understandable I guess but unfortunately many newer pipe smokers don't know the difference and subsequently have a bad experience because these tobaccos aren't designed or actually intended for use in a pipe.
