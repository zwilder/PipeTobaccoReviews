Review #7

**Blend Name:** Lane Limited 1-Q

**Description on Tin:** 1-Q is a blend of golden Virginia and black Cavendishes and a smooth flavor with an aroma that everyone loves. This mixture has been the largest selling bulk pipe tobacco in the United States for decades. See for yourself why itâ€™s so popular.
 
**Leaf:** Even mixture of light brown, dark brown, and black short ribbon cut. Moist to the touch. Noticeable even with 2 hours of drying. 

**Tin Aroma:** Delectable. Raisins and vanilla. Now I am hungry for bread pudding.

**Taste:** Starts off harsh on bitter on the light. I Frank packed it in my cob for this final tasting, which might have made the preliminary lighting even more difficult. Continues to smoke poorly, relights counted in scientific notation for ease. The taste is harsh or completely absent. An ashy taste is building on my tongue. I am tempted to put this thing down and call it a day - it doesn't stay lit, the smoke is whispy at best, and I am forced to smoke very, very slowly, as it trying to bite the back of my tongue. 

But then... I light yet again and... its actually kind of good. I make sure to take small sips (a second perhaps) and give it a long while to cool, really I am counting to 10 after each exhale. Doing this keeps the smoke creamy, but still thin - not a smoke ring to be had tonight, yet it has some actual flavor. On the fore draw it comes sweet, hard candy sugar kind of sweet. Not much when the smoke is in the mouth. However, finally, at last, yes ultimately even, when I exhale there is that touch of vanilla people talk about. When I really taste it, it is not just vanilla, but at times liquorice, root beer, cream soda, or even raisiny. But the finish doesn't last, so as soon as the exhale is gone, so are the flavors.

And then it goes out again. So I relight. Several times. Still harsh and bitter. Then I recall that the bowl was much hotter to the touch when it tasted swell. So here goes. Puff and double puff and triple puff; puff like an angry Donald Duck, until finally, yes there it is again. Hot to my fingers, now the smoke is creamy and sweet and flavorful again. Only now I have some lovely bite all over my tongue and roof of my mouth. Yippee. 

Then it goes out again and so I go at it again. And you know what? This is not very much fun. I have more than enough nicotine for the night with all this hard puffing and my mouth is tingling. I am calling this one early.

**Smokability:** Hard to light. Hard to keep lit. Even with flake-worthy drying times.

**Room Note:** Extremely pleasant. Warm and sweet and sentimental. If Thomas Kinkade painted a smell, it would be just like this.

**Thoughts:** I see this frequently brought up as a fine aromatic. An improvement upon the OTC whatever that is being disparaged in contrast. It is often suggested as good blend for beginners. In fact, this was one of the four first blends I tried.  This is my least favorite tobacco in my collection of 20 or so. I smoke it the least often. I have enjoyed it more in the past, but having had a couple of fine, easy smoking aromatics with much more flavor, I think this one is going in the 'not for me bin.' Furthermore, I will vehemently oppose suggesting this as a good tobacco for the beginning pipe smoker. It takes care to dry out. Care to pack. Patience to light. Impeccable timing to get the best flavors out of it. Navigating between flavorful and bite-city is akin to sailing between Scylla and Charybdis - and what you get out of it, really ain't worth the trouble.

**Summary:** A well loved aromatic that smokes poorly, bites, but smells phenomenal.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 2 years, and entered the world of pipes about 6 months ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

antiwittgenstein: Lulz. I have not ventured into the Pease blends yet. I will have to make sure to avoid such pitfalls. Luckily these rating markers only last 2 tobaccos, imagination willing.

====================================
jelbert6969: I have only a smoked 3 or 4oz of 1Q but I enjoyed it. It did smoke hot, it did bite and it went out on occasion but I still liked it.

====================================
pixeechick: I really enjoy reading and appreciate your reviews. Please keep them coming! (Also, are you mirror posting these on tobaccoreviews.com? I'm sure they'd be popular). 
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! I will keep churning out at least one a week until I run out of new tobaccos. No, I have not posted up on TR, but I reckon I ought to.

====================================
Darwin7848: 1Q is as good or better than most of the host of aros I've tried but saying that is a clear example of damning with faint praise.  I give it a solid Blue Dahlia as well.
--
antiwittgenstein: It's a shame about that film - it was a fantastic, well plotted murder mystery until the studio ripped up the ending and pasted something together which makes absolute no sense. Ruins the whole thing. Just like how this *could* be a passable tobacco, with less PG, and maybe a bit of burley for both body and easy smoking.

I guess I really ought to try a terrible aro so that I can appreciate this thing more.
--
Darwin7848: Try some Middleton Cherry Blend.  It makes 1Q look like sublime perfection.  In honor of Betty B.s passing you should include To Have And Have Not as the peaknuckle of your next rating ladder.
--
antiwittgenstein: The idea of tobacco and cherry, while popular, is super unappealing. Perhaps because: coffee+ cherry = Robitussin. So in my imagination I just assume it will muddle of smoke and cough syrup.

====================================
Chrisj2001: Nice review. It still blows my mind that this is the best selling blend in the States. It would be like finding Natural Ice is the top selling beer despite thousands of better brews from better breweries. I know that taste is subjective, but quality of leaf and additives is definitely not. I made a vane attempt to like the stuff, but never got it to burn right even after a 3 day drying period. Kind of a requisite for me that tobacco should burn to something resembling an ash. I'm not even saying it must be uniform, fine, white ash, just something what I could mistake for carbon. 
--
antiwittgenstein: Part of the idea of putting this up for review was trying to dispel the idea that this was some must have tobacco I recall several times in the last few weeks beginners talk about it, get recommended it, and some poor European chap was fretting about how to obtain it. It isn't a travesty, but it is nothing to worked up over.
--
Chrisj2001: It constantly comes up on desert island lists. Maybe I have too many taste buds or something, but I don't get the fascination. Especially towards the end of the bowl when the chemicals and goo all mix together. If it was maybe the only blend in existence I'd get the praise, but I really don't get it. Sadly I don't have much hair left to scratch off, so I guess I'll have to let it go.
