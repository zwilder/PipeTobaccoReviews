Mini Review: So I finally tried Penzance.

I ordered this on a lucky break about 7 months ago and was saving it for Christmas to smoke with family for the first time.  Well I finally broke it open and tried it.

First thought:  It isn't mind blowing.  But with all the hype I have to admit my expectations were ridiculous anyway.

What it is is as good of an English blend as any I have smoked.

The key words that came to my mind were "creamy" and "balanced".

Ok, let me back up a bit.  It comes arranged in thick flakes that are just as fragile as everyone says they are.  In my opinion this is just fine because they are quite easy to rub out. (Honestly I dont understand when people complain about this because it isn't like you would fold and stuff this anyway). The moisture from the tin was about spot on to smoke right away.

It has all the flavors one would expect from a good English, but the latakia is perfectly balaced with the other components.  Speaking of the latakia, this definitely contains the sweeter, rather than smokier, variety.  The orientals and VAs stay in the background but meld in just as they are needed.  Actually, beyond the sweetness of the latakia, no particular leaf dominated.

The mouthfeel was definitely creamy and thick.  It somewhat recalls Frog Morton On The Town, but if there is any casing it is not obvious, Penzance creates the flavor naturally where OTT seems to fill it out with a topnote.  But I would say these two blends do have a bit of similarity in overall taste/feel.  

In the end, while not any sort of earth shattering revelation, Penzance is quite good and gives the impression of refined quality.

I would say that it is in my top 2 English blends along with H&H Magnum Opus.  To compare these, think of classical music, MO is the part where the various sections thunderously call and retort almost battling, Penzance is the smooth calm part where every instrument is in peaceful harmony and not one stands out.  Very different but very good.
====================================
forwormsbravepercy: Love that analogy at the end!

Occams-shaving-cream: Thanks!

====================================
PeskyPrussian: Spot on review I'd say.  Smoothness, balance and complexity are the words I would use when describing Penzance. In my experience, there's no such thing as a mind blowing pipe tobacco. Tobacco smoke just isn't that intense in flavor in general, but some blends provide perfect blends of flavor and a satisfying, memorable experience and this is one of them.
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Complexity, that is one I left out.  The complexity of Penzance is very subdued because of how well it blends. 
--
SMIDSY: Just had some during a smoke break at work. Have to agree on the complexity. Seems like it tastes a little different every time I have a bowl. Sometimes it's more meaty, sometimes more smokey, but always delicious and enough nicotine to keep me interested during a long smoke.
--
====================================
RxBro: Penzance is a bit mild for my taste. Agree with your notes about creamy and balanced. I guess I just prefer fuller bodied English blends. Then again, I've only had it 3 or 4 times, so I may grow to appreciate it more.
--
XOrAcLeX: This.  I wasn't all that impressed with Penzance five years ago when I was able to first obtain a few tins.  This summer I cracked a tin from 2011 that I had cellared.  It was decent, but it definitely doesn't live up to the hype that it receives here and on the forums.  I'd actually prefer some 965 almost any day over Penzance.
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Tbh, it was a bit before I realized that despite bold tastes Englishes are pretty mild overall, of course I dont really care for lat boms like Nightcap.  Do you like Lakeland blends?  Funny as hell to differentiate them from "English" blends, but I have developed a taste for them of late and many pack quite a punch.
--
RxBro: I haven't! Any specific blends I should check out? 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: I like Brown flake scented, and 1792 flake.  They are both very different from most stuff I have smoked.

Brown flake has a floral sort of flavor, rose hips I believe, first bowl is kinda WTF?  But it grows on you and there isn't really anything like it.

1792 flake is STOUT VA and dfk with tonquin bean, it is supposed to be vanilla flavored, but it smells like raisin bread to me with the dfk barbeque type smokiness.  It is also not one that is love at first puff, but it grows on you and, again, there isn't really anything else like it.  This one is probably the strongest tobacco I have had.
--
====================================
TheRedReverend: It's a great blend. For other more easily obtained Englishes I rank above it (sans hype and price point probably helps this list): gaslight, ten Russians, Presbyterian, peretti's Cambridge flake, quiet nights, and King Charles mixture. 
--
Poopsock_Piper: I do agree with the Gaslight, I rank it above Penzance as well.
--
TheRedReverend: I mean objectively penzance may be better than a couple of these, but when you factor in price, availability, and hassle, which I would, then it outranks it. But gaslight is heaven. 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: I will have to try some of those.  I was hosted a Frog Morton sampler last year, and have bought several English blends, but I find that I really dont smoke them very quickly.  I go through VA flakes and ropes much faster, and the variety in those is more emphasized whereas many Englishs taste quite similar.
--
====================================
fortheLOVEofBACON: For me, it's all in the last third of the bowl. When your sipping and sipping and you don't want the flavor blasts to end, then you're done with the bowl. Balance is what I would agree on with your review. 
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Yeah, it develops nicely. Need to smoke a few more bowls to really 'get' it, I find it takes 3-4 to really understand a blend.
--
====================================
mgvsquared: Penzance is really solid. It's not incredible, but I'll said it again as I always do. You can find some really close alternatives if you really want. And those make me not too hot to seek out Penzance. I'll buy it if I see it. I'll try to order if I get an email notification. But I don't hunt it down.

Really good review though. It hits just about how I feel. Balanced. Quality. The Esoterica line is all about quality. People rave and hoot and holler about Penzance and Stonehaven, but really they are not the stars of Esoterica, at least to me. The shag cuts are. Tilbury, ASTB, Margate, Pembroke, Woodbridge, etc. They are delights to smoke. In fact, I'm going home in a little bit to load up a brand new Stanwell pipe with some Tibury. They just pack and burn perfectly.
--
Occams-shaving-cream: 
I happened to be browsing this sub and caught a notification that it was in stock.  Wanted to try it at least once.


I will have to try some of those.  So far I have had Dorchester, Dunbar, Peacehaven, Penzance and (yuck) Blacklool.

The VaPers are a bit too damned sweet imho, I guess that is the perique?  Very figgy.  Peacehaven is a damned fine VA though.
--
mgvsquared: Perique should have a musky odor by itself, or as Jon David of CSR and The Country Squire has described, an odor like a mushroom farted. I think it generally adds a zesty or spicy note to most tobaccos. The sweetness is probably the yellow or bright VA. When a VA is more savory and rich, its a red. Since most Esotericas are VA blends of some sort, their flavor profiles are all over the place. Haven't had Peacehaven though...is it a shag?
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Broken flake, almost shaglike.  It is very sweet, I think it has a honey casing.  Couldn't be sure, and they don't claim it, but it is the sweetest bright VA I have ever had.  Like lemon grass dipped in honey.

Their capers, well Dorchester and Dunbar, are both very sweet and have a similar flavor.  It is good but I suspect there is some casing, Dorchester tastes a lot like fig Newtons.

====================================
freepancakesforall: I think you nailed the review. I'm one of the people that thinks this tobacco is not overhyped or overrated. I think it deserves its fanfare.    

Tasting flavors is largely subjective and depends on palettes, olfactory health, environment, etc. But production consistency isn't. If you don't love the flavors, I get it. There ARE great, similar tobaccos available for less. But if you DO like the flavors, Esoterica knocks every single pitch out of the park and I can be 99.99% sure that when I open an aged tin of Penzance in the future, it will be exactly how I'd like it to be. And that's something I can't say the same for a lot of blenders.    

I won't chase it down or overpay for it, but I'll buy it when I can and keep it on the top shelf.
--
Occams-shaving-cream: I mostly agree.  I would say it *is* overhyped but not overrated.  It is a fine blend.

The tin will likely last a while, but I will likely order another next time I see it available.
--
freepancakesforall: Yeah, I'll concede to the hype. 
--
====================================
TheMadPeterson: It took me a few bowls and a couple pipes to "figure out" Penzance. 

I have a couple pounds of it cellared away, and have dedicated said pipe to it. It is overhyped, don't get me wrong, but there is a reason for the hype too. 

Same can be said for Stonehaven, which I find varies by the bowl. When it's good, it is oh so good. When it's not, it's good but makes me wonder why I go through the hassle of hunting it down. I guess I just haven't found the right pipe that lets me consistently get a great result. I also smoke it less frequently than Penzance, as my stash isn't as deep.
--
Occams-shaving-cream: Yeah, kinda wish I had a fresh pipe to smoke it in...  Hmmm, new excuse for pad, lol.
--
TheMadPeterson: The funny thing is that the pipe was a <$50 estate random purchase off of eBay. It's a Cellini's Original bulldog that I kind of picked up on a whim, as I liked the story behind the brand. No idea why Penzance tasted better in it versus my other pipes, but who am I to tempt fate?
