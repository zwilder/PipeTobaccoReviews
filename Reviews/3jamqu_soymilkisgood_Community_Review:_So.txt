====================================
PipeBeard: No bite, no bitter, big "burley cocoa" aroma, just the right nuttiness, stout, but not too strong.  There's not many burley blends that rival (dare I say best) a Peretti burley in my eyes, but I think this one is the benchmark. 4 stars.

====================================
JLowU571: **Blend**: Solani Aged Burley Flake

**Tin Note**: Notes of stewed apples, raisins, dates and molasses.

**Moisture Content**: *Very* sticky out of the tin, you'd swear it was a heavily topped aro. About 20-30 minutes drying time.

**Appearance**: Dark brown flake, mottled with yellow and pitch black spots.

**On the Char light**: That Burley nuttiness wafts up from the initial application of the match accompanied by a hint of baked goods.

**First Third**: A surprising spiciness hits first, hot on the heels are sugary fruit cake flavours with a subtle hint of caramel.

**Second Third**: The initial spiciness fades into buttery smooth nuttiness. Ah, this is what Burley is *meant* to be! Flowing in and out is the sugary, stewed fruit notes that are so sweet it's hard to believe it *isn't* topped. I took my first whiff of the room note here and found it a pleasant mix of caramel and molasses.

**Last Third**: The sugary sweetness begins to fade into more natural, tobacco sweetness. The spiciness of the first third returns with deep, earthy notes. I found that I detected sweet meats in the flavour but I could be wrong.

**Nicotine**: Quite strong for me, but then again I'm not used to flakes.

**Verdict**: This blend brings Burley into the limelight, delivering everything that is promised from that leaf. It's nutty, deep, earthy and has is the sweetest non-aro I've ever encountered. Even with the high moisture content and nicotine, Solani Aged Burley has earned its place among my favourite blends with ease.

**Score**: 10/10.

tochrais: I couldn't pick out any of the more subtle flavors you describe but this is a new favorite for me. I am pretty new to flake tobacco but Solani behaved very well for me whether rubbed or cubed. I have to take this one outside though. I enjoyed the smoky room note but non-smoking significant others might not. I'd give it a 10/10 also.

Mordenkrad: Lets put it like this.

Solani 656 is the essential Virginia/Burley complete with the off-color fermented fruit notes, the raw earthy and nutty characteristics of good burley, and a soft almost chocolatey rounded body. The Virginia in the blend is barely noticeable, but it adds that little bit of extra sweetness I think the blend needs. Finally, the flake is most likely treated with some kind of sweetner, but almost every blend is; it compliments the flavors of the smoke very nicely.

If you don't know/don't like burley blends, this is a 3/4. 

If you ever liked a burley blend, this is a 4/4 all the way. 

It's definitely worth a shot. I've got about 8 tins in my cellar, so consider this review biased as fuck.

PipeBeard: The description from the web seem to indicate that there isn't any sweetener (or VA) added.

"A skillful mixture of three aged Burley's - dark brown Burley from Kentucky, light Burley from Brazil, and white Burley from Malawi - Southeast Africa. A very natural blend with absolutely no additives or flavors - a true Burley blend."

It definitely has a sweetness and complexity akin to molasses, which I really enjoy.

EDIT - thought I had the description from the distributors site, but got it somewhere else.

hedonaut: Let me start vy saying apologies on the late review. As one of this sub's confirmed burley nuts, I would be remiss in not commenting on this one. I had some of this in jars sitting for a year or two untouched. I'd tried it and felt a little hold and cold about it before. The flavor was good when it burned right, but I had some trouble coaxing it's best out. Well I suppose my skill has developed over the years, because coming back to it was like finding a long lost love. Onto my thoughts, in essay form for the community review. 

The first thing to strike me about this blend was the savory spice it had going on. This is no black pepper and nicotine perique, but rather a sort of floral mix of savory flavors I only find in abundance with blends like Dark Flake U/S. I've found similar notes in well aged American dark burleys, but they seem to me the main note in that African burley I've come to love. This is overlayed with creamy notes of wood and earth, cigar-like in description but radically different in experience. The texture of the smoke is again creamy, almost chewey, lending added weight to the molasses sweetness propping everything up. As the smoke progresses, the sweetness and earth builds, offset by the spicey character. I get whiffs of fruit and nuts interspersed, but I think the interplay of spice against the sweet, heavy backdrop is the main show. 

I smoked this rubbed out. I might go back and tinker with various flake prep methods, but I found rubbing out really brings out the qualities I most admire in this stuff. This community review pushed me to revisit a blend I'd nearly dismissed. I'm grateful because I'd probably put this in a top ten list most days. Excellent blend and a good place to start exploring burleys from across the sea.

None: Cocoa, licorice, and coffee. Subtle but if you give it some time and thought it is quite good. When I first tasted it, I had been smoking Carter Hall to break in a new pipe, and I thought it was a bit too similar for the extra price. Then I really sat down with it and laughed at my previous stupidity. Yes, CH has the same sort of flavor, but no where near the depth. In all, I found that this blend is great and flavorful but takes concentration to appreciate, else you might as well smoke any other burley.
