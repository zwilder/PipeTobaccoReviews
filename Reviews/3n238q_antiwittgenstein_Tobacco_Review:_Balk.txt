Tobacco Review: Balkan Sasieni
By: antiwittgenstein

Review #51

**Blend Name:** Balkan Sasieni

**Description on Tin:** Originial formula Balkan smoking mixture was created in London at the beginning of the century by the Master of Tobacco Blenders who first combined the aromatic pleasures of the choicest of Macedonia and Latakia leaf with the richness of Old Virginia to give the pipe smoker an unrivalled smoking pleasure.
 
**Leaf:** Large grain gunpowder with speckles of short tan leaf.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Pine smoke. Vaguely floral and soapy. Burnt rubber.

**Taste:** Heavy cream with loads of spices. Ummami bomb, mushrooms and soy sauce. Garlic and leeks. Tangy, citrus and vinegar. Like some good VA is in there. An undercurrent of the floral, lavender. Ah, more like lavender soap. We meet again Latakia. Which is strange because I only get the soapiness – no smoke has shown up yet. But the funky presence of Turkish or Oriental (I don’t know the difference on my palate yet) is quite apparent. A few puffs later, a very faint smokiness. Really I wish had the vocabulary to explain these exotic flavors, they come on wild, spiraling flashes of green and purple and the seething babble of life spilling over from the edge of the forest. If we cannot see colors we have no names for, then how do we smell or taste anything at all? I guess by metaphor and memory.  Peppercorn and cream sauce. Sort of like a hearty sausage gravy with a lurid pool of grease floating on top. Complex and tightly woven. A piquant tanginess comes across, more in the school of oriental than Virginia. Does it sound like I like it? It should. Cedar and pine and oak – I hope that isn’t rim char from my relight. Tangy still off and on. Stays at the exact midpoint between sweet and dry throughout the smoke. That is cleverly done. Becomes more gentle, the pepper fading, the cream deepening mixing with growing woodiness, with a touch of smoke at the finish. Pairs excellently with the smell of early Autumn rain and the feeling of the world settling in for longer nights, cozy, cold, and quiet. 

**Nicotine:** Moderate. Can catch me if I smoke it without having dinner in me first.

**Smokability:** Quite easy. Very spongy which makes it a perfect fit for the Frank. Billows up when you hit it with flame, even on relights. Creates a thick velvety ash you have to remove from the bowl to avoid suffocating your cherry.
 
**Room Note:** Smokey, a bit of incense.

**Thoughts:** I have been preparing for this review over the last few weeks which means I have smoked it pretty consistently but I was surprised to see that I have only a bowl or two left in the tin. That was surprising. 

I have of late changed my smoking habits. Up until recently I kept basically all of my tobaccos in an *open* state – smoking whatever called to me, sometimes reaching for a brand new purchase, an old favorite, or a tobacco I hadn’t touched in six months. My brother told me he got quite a bit out of his aromatics when he smoked them consistently in the same bowl. I tried it and the guy knows what he is talking about. Flavor builds up, the bowl soaks in, and you can taste everything without focusing so white knuckle. Without even thinking about it, I have done the same thing with my other non-aromatic briars. And I think it helps immensely. But it also means that while I would dib and dab at a jar for a year, I am racing through the tobacco. So Sayonara Sasieni. But sooner rather than later, I will grab another tin of you.

Oh yeah, the tobacco. There are other Balkans, specifically one, which is much more famous and two-or-three times as expensive. This is not like that one which rages with the high keening wail of blonde hashish. This is a more subtle affair, marrying together different flavors into a shifting delight. When I prepped my bowl for the review I thought I might watch some tele or so, but once I started smoking, I was so intent upon the flavors, slowing my cadence and catching its spirit in the review, I was wholly entertained. That, pipemates, is exactly what a good Balkan blend should do.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Sutliff Bosophorous Cruise, C&D Mountain Camp

**Summary:** A well integrated gentle Balkan with pronounced cream flavors.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about one and a half years ago. My current top three are: H&H Anniversary Kake, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
cubicleninja: YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

MOONRAKER WAS AN EXCELLENT FILM.  TRULY A TRIUMPH IN THE THEATRICAL ARTS.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: That was my recollection too from when I watched it as a 12 year old.
--
cubicleninja: EXACTLY.

This is my friggin childhood we're talking about here.  Plus, the leading lady's name was "Holly Goodhead".  I mean, come on.  That's some quality screenplay writing right there.
--
antiwittgenstein: I watched 'A View to a Kill' as a kid, so that is why it was so highly rated despite being, well kind of awful. I am sorry to do a disservice to your own childhood.
--
====================================
Godecapitator: Whoa. That was a really in depth review. Nice. No expert here but one thing I wanted to clarify is that Turkish & Orientals are one & the same. It took me awhile to understand that myself.
P.S. I love this particular tobacco.
--
chewsyourownadv: Nope. Turkish is considered to be a type of Oriental. They are not synonymous; Oriental is the superset. Turkish tobacco is often distinguished from other Oriental strains because it is used more frequently than other strains, besides Smyrna, which is the typical foremost component of latakia.

edit: I should actually say that there are multiple strains of Turkish tobaccos, and the set of Turkish tobaccos is a subset of Oriental tobaccos.
--
antiwittgenstein: That...that is super confusing. Thanks for the clarification pipemate.
--
====================================
Bleeding_Rainbow: I love your ever increasingly whimsical reviews... Especially "the seething babble of life spilling over from the edge of the forest". That's some philosophical shit right there. 
Have you been reading House of Leaves? Because "rages with the high keening wail of blonde hashish" sounds a lot like something Johnny Truant would say...
--
antiwittgenstein: I have yet to read the House of Leaves but it is on the list. Thanks, I enjoy this chance to force my style on other people without having to start a blog or attend open mic nights. And my 1st degree was in Philosophy, so yeah, it comes out sometimes...
--
chewsyourownadv: > House of Leaves but it is on the list

This is one of the very few horror books I've been able to enjoy as an adult. It's genuinely creepy and unsettling to me. It's also a very dense read. Good luck!
--
====================================
3CATTS: Great review. i especially like the addition of some pipe usage/smoking advice. I tend to smoke different things all the time as well, but have recently decided to focus on one or two open containers at a time. As I only smoke a few times a week at most, it will be interesting to see how that works out.
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: Nice review. I sometimes think Balkan Sasieni is underrated, largely because it blatantly tried to compare itself to the old Sobranie. Usually when I see reviews, the review is not really about Sasieni, but more about how it fails to be Sobranie. It's the manufacturer's fault I think, as they started the comparison. Be that as it may, it's a great blend. I absolutely love those initial sour notes that come in with the normal Balkan flavors.

Now, there's a bit in your review that sticks out to me: 

>But the funky presence of Turkish or Oriental (I don’t know the difference on my palate yet)

One of the difficulties in categorizing Balkans and some English tobaccos is in the variety of "Oriental" strains they might use. The selection really is large and diverse. Some Oriental strains are floral, some spicy, some a bit sweet. [Allow me to introduce you to some friends who will be more than happy to help you navigate the labyrinth of variety.](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/brands/1970/mcclelland-grand-orientals/)
--
antiwittgenstein: Ha, I watched Public Piper's new review of those yesterday and have been salivating ever since. I owe it to myself and the the pipe community to get those for research purposes. 
--
chewsyourownadv: There are some interesting ones in there. Drama Reserve is my favorite just as a stand-alone blend so far. Smyrna is interesting in that it helps you understand what latakia is like without the dark-fired curing. And the Katarini is just something completely unexpected. I really had no idea how much variety there is in Oriental strains until I started sampling these blends.
--
dassphinx: I second Drama Reserve. Classic Samsun is a nice blend too. It kind of tastes like an English sans the Latakia. Though, it could be just my palate.
--
====================================
None: Great blend IMO.
--
====================================
poops_in_public: Smoked: Tasted smokiness.
*edit room note: a bit smokey
