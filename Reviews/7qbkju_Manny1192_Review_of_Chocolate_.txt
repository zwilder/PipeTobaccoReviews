====================================
Manny1192: Alright so first off props to u/fuzzy_totemz for making this custom blend for me before Christmas, best present I got for myself.

This is my first review and I'm still pretty new so bare with me while I get through this with you all.

So to start, yes I did jar this right away.

Jar notes upon opening: smells like a chocolate covered peanut butter rice crispy ball. I used to eat those with my little brother at xmas time by the tray full (thank you mom). So you get hints of a dark chocolate, nutty earthy type of smell to and it's very enjoyable.

Room note: back to that earthy chocolate notes, I could let it sit there and burn and not smoke it and be that content about it. It's fantastic (guilty of letting it burn more than I smoke because I do a lot in the garage while I smoke so it sits on my lips or on the pipe rest.)

Taste: here's where it shines the most. So if you like chocolate (dark chocolate not that milk garbage) and every once in a while you're like.. man I want a bite of a 80% dark chocolate bar that sweet/bitter taste you get while you're thinking about it well that's the closest I can describe it. Not sickly sweet by any means but a nice smooth desert type of taste that just about satisfies that craving. As you burn through you taste some nutty almost salted caramel taste??
Anyways I'm trying to tongue bite as I'm writing this and I'm just incapable (it's -9 so I'm cold)

Overall this is my regular rotation and I just got 2 more oz but I'll likely need a pound at some point.

4/4 for this blend
Smoked outside in a royal knight
A strong coffee goes amazing with it.

Thanks everyone! And thanks Fuzzy
