Review Morning smoke with my Fairly New Walther Pipe
By: claypainter
---
I purchased another pipe from Dan at [AmericanPipeMakers](http://americanpipemakers.com/) and I thought I would post some thoughts and images.  
  
I loaded this up for the second time with one of my favorites, JackKnife Plug.  
The [Walther Pipe](http://imgur.com/a/0qjAc) is beautiful. I really love the grain and sandblast on this. The size and bend makes it easily the most comfortable pipe I have to hold hands-free in the mouth.  
You know the magical smokes that one gets from time to time? This morning's was one of them. The tobacco tasted especially good, the coffee paired terrifically and at the end of the smoke I had that deep-seated feeling that everything is going to be ok.

PastorPuff: That is a beautiful pipe as is the tamper, tell me about that too!

claypainter: Thanks, PastorP. The tamper is an 8deco rosewood tamper I've had for a long time. Nothing too fancy. Yours for $10 from smoking pipes.

I really like the concavity of the 8deco tampers.
