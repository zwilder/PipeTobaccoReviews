Tobacco review: McClelland Anniversary 2010
By: tankbuster183

I've wanted to do a review for a while now, and while I don't have the most refined palate, I've certainly smoked enough tobacco to share an opinion.  Last night being the first evening in over a week that wasn't 90+ degrees, it was a perfect time for a walk, so I loaded my Peterson 312, grabbed the dog, and hit the pavement.

**Blend:** McClelland Anniversary 2010, Virginia, latakia. Tin note is sweet, but now overpowering. Some latakia present, but not a punch in the face.  Ketchup smell not as bold as other McClelland blends.

**Prep:**  This tin has been open for over a year, but I find the plastic snap lids on McClelland products keep the tobacco quite fresh.    But as we keep preaching on this sub: dry your tobacco, dry your tobacco, dry your tobacco.  It lights better, smokes better, and tastes better.  McClelland has released their anniversary blend 3 times and this is the 2010 release with the brown wax seal.

**The light:**  I lit it.

**The smoke:**  The initial flavor is a burst of sweetness from the Virginas, I'm talking almost a mellow sugarcane.  Really sweet tobacco goodness.  The latakia is apparent, but playing a supporting role here, giving some body to the smoke without overpowering the Virginia.  Think of it as the bass player: unless you're listening to Primus/Jaco, it's not the focus.  Using a P-lip was a good choice, as the latakia hit the roof of my mouth, and made for a nice retrohale.  The flavors meld over the course of the smoke until about the last third, where the latakia is stronger, and the sweetness of the Virginias has dissipated and has given way to a toasty, dry, somewhat ashy-bland finish: not unpleasant, but nothing special.  Bowl smoked down to a coarse purple ash (jk, it was fine white/gray ash like every other tobacco ever).  Didn't feel a nicotine buzz, hardly ever do.

**Consensus:** I didn't love this blend when I first opened it, but the age has done those fine McClelland Virginias some good.  Anyone who has smoked McClelland blends will know the Virginias I'm talking about, they are just superior in every way.  I've smoked the Frog Morton blends, which I find to be overrated; don't get me wrong, they're good, but I feel McClelland's strength lies in their Virginias.  This anniversary blend is really a Virginia blend with some latakia to showcase the natural sweetness of those Virginias.  I don't particularly love Virginia blends (I'm one of the 3 people who doesn't like OGS) but this really hit the spot without tasting too cigarette like, and made for a nice change.  The only complaint people may have is the finish is somewhat weak and it's not too complex but I like that: it lets the tobacco speak for itself.  Recommended.  Not knock your socks off, but worth having on the shelf for when you aren't in the mood for a straight English or Virginia flake.

**Background:**  I'm an English-Oriental lover, but I'll sneak in some 1Q from time to time.  Favorites are Dunhill London Mixture, 965, EMP, & SPS Kasimir.  Limit myself to a few bowls a week.

**Rating:  +++**
Rating system in honor of /r/antiwittgenstein based on Metallica's albums:

(+++++) This just melted my face (Master of Puppets).

(++++) This is quintessential thrash (Ride the Lightening).

(+++) I really like this (and Justice for All).

(++) Pretty good (Kill em All)

(+) this is the standard metal album of the 90s (Black)

(+/-) I can take or leave this (Death Magnetic)

(-) this isn't as good as I'd hoped (Garage Days)

(--) this is really not what I wanted (Load)

(---) I'm losing faith in this band (Re-Load)

(----) you should be ashamed to call yourselves Metallica(St Anger)

(-----) this is the clown shoes of the music world (Lulu)

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Ha! Great review, nice grading system. Now that you've started, keep going. You will be amazed what the thoughtful analysis of the smoke for your reviewers does for your palate and provides a ready made rationalization for smoking more often and doubling the size of your cellar.

"I would cut my legs and tits off  
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski  
In the dark of the moon  

It made me dream of Nosferatu  
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau  
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely"
