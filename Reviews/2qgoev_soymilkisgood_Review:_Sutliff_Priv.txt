Review: Sutliff Private Stock Barbados Plantation

**Blend Name:** Sutliff Private Stock Barbados Plantation

**Description on Tin:** Sweet Barbados rum, smooth & rich.

**Leaf:** Black Cavendish, Burley, Virginia

**Appearance:** Coarse ribbon cut. About 50/50 ratio of black tobaccos (the Cavendish) to the medium colored Burleys and Virginias. Relatively moist straight out of the freshly opened tin.

**Tin Aroma:** Vanilla and a vague note of sweet alcohol. I am not really a rum drinker so what I’m smelling could be rum, but it smells more like a flavoring than anything natural to me. It is an inviting scent, though, and I think it does give me the feeling of being in the tropics somewhere with a nice, sweet cocktail in my hand.

**Taste:** Vanilla is a big flavor component here. Though the rum flavoring (if I can call it that) does add a little something extra. Though as with all other aromatics, most of the “taste” as it were is in the room rather than out of the pipe. The burley and Virginia give it a little bit of body, but they play a supporting role rather than a leading one (and a muted one at that). The taste of actual tobacco is near nonexistent, but that’s also not unexpected.

**Strength and Nicotine:** Nothing to see here. It’s like I’m just puffing on sweetly scented air. Move along now.

**Smokeability:** It’s pretty nice, and what I’d expect of Sutliff aromatics at this point. Solid vanilla flavoring with a little bit of that rum topping that give it a little bit of interest. Nothing harsh or terrible about it either, so it’s a pretty solid aromatic for me.

**Room Note:** Vanilla, vanilla…a little bit of that kind of background note of alcohol that you’d get if you splashed some in your favorite dish. It’s kind of there only if you smell for it, and certainly not something you’d necessarily pick out without knowing what it was. 

**Thoughts:** Another Sutliff Aromatic with some nice vanilla flavoring and a sugary, alcohol-y topping of rum. Like the other aromatics from them that I’ve tried, not much in the way of flavor from the tobaccos themselves. The topping is where it’s at.

**Recommend to:** An aromatic smoker and/or someone that wants to smoke in front of non-smokers (girlfriends and wives primarily). Someone who wants to be reminded of grandpa’s aromatics. A rum drinker. Someone from the Caribbean that wants to be reminded of home.

**Summary:** A Sutliff aromatic that would go perfectly with a rum and coke or another tropical drink for a day at the beach. 

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes). 

Disclosure: I contacted Sutliff myself a couple months ago to ask to be a part of their reviewing team. I was accepted and received six tins of Sutliff Private Stock in the mail. The only condition on this free tobacco was to provide honest reviews to the community, so this one of many that I'll be doing as part of the program!

====================================
Mordenkrad: Would you describe this blend as sexy, arousing, or in any way erotic?

soymilkisgood: Arousing in that it makes me think of the beach and attractive women in skimpy clothes on said beach. Then I think of old people in skimpy clothes on the beach, and it's not as arousing.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Thanks for the review mate. I will post my own once it is tiki drink season again. The only difference in our experiences is that my tin was so soaked in PG it was oozing out the metal in a protolife form that seemed to exhibit some rudimentary ability to speak until I froze it to death in my freezer.
