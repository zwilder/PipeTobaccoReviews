====================================
hello_josh: I don't think I've seen a tobacco review with so many data points before XD. I listen to their podcast and have been meaning to order a sampler of some popular blends, especially ones I've heard them discuss on the show. Have any favorites?
--
mgvsquared: Aros: Tobac du Chocolat, Blue Ribbon, Treasure Island

I don't care for their traditional English offerings. But of the non-aros I enjoy:

Fleur-de-Lis, Lowland Pine (essentially an American Light English), Green Dragon, Pirate's Alley 
--
hello_josh: Excellent. Thanks for the list.

blackhawkwalker: That's my home tobacco shop. Great place, love it there!

Fuzzy_Totemz: They reviewed their own tobacco?
--
pylorns: I reviewed it... just didn't identify it as myself.
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Well, it's cool they posted your review then.  
  
Your problem with apple blends sounds like my problem with most cherry blends.   
   
What other Apple blends have you tried?  
--
hello_josh: /u/pylorns is their web developer so he probably posted it himself
--
pylorns: It's a good point I should change the author to me...
--
pylorns: Sutliff Apple.. its kinda meh.. also I've had one of Russ' apple blends, that wasn't half bad.
--
pylorns: Oh and there is one more that was a drugstore blend in a pouch that was horrible.
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: I think that was a Middleton abomination.  
--
pylorns: Yes, that was horrible.
