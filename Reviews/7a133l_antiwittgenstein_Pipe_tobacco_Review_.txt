Pipe tobacco Review Contest
By: antiwittgenstein

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Happy Halloween from /r/pipetobacco 's first supervillan.

This is not a mail call. No gloating or bragging about my luck. This is also not an act of spontaneous generosity. This is an act of reddit terrorism. 

When /u/PhysicsNovice posted Stonehaven was available I bought some immediately knowing I would use it for this unsavory purpose. I knew I could use this nigh impossible to attain blend to bend /r/pipetobacco to my will. Not through threat, or wheddling, or coercion, but by relying upon the greed and desire of all you smokers, relying upon supply and demand, relying upon that good old human nature which is the downfall of every society.

I have 10 samples (half flakes) of Stonehaven I will give out to those who produce the best and most reviews in the month of November.

**The Rules:**

* You have to have been a member of /r/pipetobacco prior to today, October 31st, 2017.
* Pipe reviews have to be original
* Pipe reviews have to be posted on this sub
* Text only reviews. No videos, no spoken word, no pipe tobacco reviews that are a bimonthly curated basket of snacks
* Reviews must be of sufficient length and quality. They don't have to be my sprawling victorian works, but more than a few sentences. If it isn't up to snuff I won't count it. There are no formal guidelines, use whatever format you like. It is arbitrary and cruel, like life.
* I want reviews on blends that are under reviewed. So nothing that has been reviewed in the sub more than 3 times in the last 3 years.
* This contest is only open to people who have not tried Stonehaven before. This is about making this sub better and letting more smokers be disappointed by the hobby's white whale.
* This contest is open to everyone on Earth. Apologies to our pipe smoking astronauts. No matter where you live, if you put in the work, I will mail this little sample to you anywhere on the planet. You pay the taxman though if they getcha.
* 5 Samples go to those with the 5 most reviews over the next month. Again, bad reviews don't count, so put in some time and thought. If there is a tie for place, those with the reviews I like better get the Stonehaven, so don't phone it in. 
* 5 Samples go to those with the best reviews over the next month. I get to decide what is best. 
* Please tag me in the reviews you want considered. My user name is hard to spell, it is easier to copy and paste it.
* The contest ends November 30th, midnight, GMT -5
* Mods - delete this post if you refuse to negotiate with terrorists. Or sticky it if you agree with my unscrupulous methods.

Good luck

wangchung80: Well at least it’s Stonehaven that didn’t end up on eBay or on a consignment website! Hopefully this gets others motivated for worthwhile reviews!  Good idea indeed.

AHobbitOfMiddleEarth: This is the most dramatic post I've seen on this sub yet and I don't know if I should turn away from reviewing a blend just to oppose the control you think you have or really try it because I'm curious about the Stonehaven and the excitement of winning. 
--
hello_josh: Haha. His reviews are similar. Good stuff :)
--
antiwittgenstein: Eh, it's halloween. I decided to have fun with it.

AHobbitOfMiddleEarth: Well done!

professor_throway: Awesome I will gladly step up the review game as I have a few backlogged that I have been meaning to get posted. 

Can I play as champion for someone else since I have had Stonehaven before?

antiwittgenstein: I'll allow it.

im_a_lurker_too: I don't even know what the fuss is about with Stonehaven but, I'll take the opportunity to develop my palette and work on my writing skills for a chance at trying something new for free.
