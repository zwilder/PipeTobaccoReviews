Aromatic smoker tries some english. My noobish review
By: Andy-J

Hi guys, first a small bit of background: I'm not a tobacco connoisseur by any means, I've been smoking off and on for about three years. I do, however, have an above average sense of smell and a decent palette for picking out flavors in food. I have only tried what's offered at my local TinderBox, and have stuck to the "house" brand aromatics except for a light run of trying out some [Elizabethan](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/pipe-tobacco/73668/dunhill-elizabethan-mixture/#p-131172) (I didn't care for it). My favorite at the current time is [Dan's Blue Note](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/4329/dan-tobacco-blue-note). It can be really potent when fresh, but gets better once it dries out. Anyway....

Today I picked up three new cobs and asked the guy what he would recommend for a non-aromatic, or what his favorite english blend was. I mentioned that I tried Elizabethan already. He pointed me to [Rattray's 3 Noggins](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/946/rattray-3-noggins). I just got done my first bowl and its very easy to smoke with very little flavor. I could see it as an everyday smoke easily since its very mellow and doesn't have any complex flavors hitting you all at once. I'll be smoking more and may do another review, but this is a first impressions post, so **TL;DR: mellow, low flavor, easy to smoke**.

Now he also recommended Frog Morton, which seems to have a bit of infamy around here. Just hearing about this for the first time a couple days ago, I asked him if he had any FMC ([Frog Morton's Cellar](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/pipe-tobacco/68264/mcclelland-frog-mortons-cellar/) for anyone unfamiliar). He had a can, 50g, and so I decided what the hell, I'll buy it too. Wow, this stuff is different for sure. My first surprise was the chunk of charred wood in the tin, which led me to read the label a little further and discover the idea behind this tobacco, which I won't go to far into here. First I took a big whiff of the tin, found plum, whisky, sage, all enveloped in an overwhelming char-smoked campfire scent. I packed a bowl in a fresh cob and lit that puppy up. GOT DAYUM. It tasted like a lot of scottish whiskies that are HEAVY on the barrel flavors. It tasted a lot like the smell you get around a autumn campfire, with a sweetness underneath similar to that of baking bread. I'm not sure if you guys have ever had the *pleasure* of being *blessed* by a hippie waving around burnt sage, but that taste is definitely here. If you want a better idea, either grab some sage and burn it or even light some green tea for almost the exact scent. It was a bit too much at first and seemed like I wouldn't enjoy it, but as the first bowl burned down I started to notice the different flavors. This isn't one I'll smoke every day, too complex. This seems to be a nice contemplative tobacco for long sessions of armchair philosophy or even late night whisky-fueld discussions among friends. **TL;DR: Strong smokey flavor, campfire, burnt sage, whiskey, seems very complex**


Thanks for reading. Lemme know how close I am to your opinions on these or if you just want to chime in and tell me how wrong I am about them, do that to ;D

Chuzordie: I have been blessed by a hippie with the smoldering sage,  said it was for positive energy an cleansing of negative energies.  Then we got to talking things about stuff and then she showed me her homemade apple cider,  remember much after that i do not.  Maybe in a few more months of slowly sipping my burleys i'll look into FM series again.  For reals though .. i got to smoke what i have an NOT buy more stuffs.

That's the major quality I look for in English and Balkan blends and it's what keeps me smoking. I'll never understand how people could *not* love that, but to each his own...I think I'm actually the weirdo, not everyone else.
