I'm not gonna go super in depth here - cause i've only smoked one bowl(actually still smoking the last bit of it while i write). Also, big thanks to u/FreestateFreehand for hooking me up with this tin that he got from the kansas city pipe show

Smoked a bowl of current Royal Yacht just about an hour earlier to help compaire

**Tin/tobacco condition - 5/5**. Still had original moisture and made a swish when i opened it. tobacco has quite a bit of plume all throughout. Tobacco is much darker and sliced more thinly than the current stuff.

**Tin note:** Pretty close to the current stuff, slightly more fruity. Smells good.

**Smoking characteristics:** Look a couple charring lights to spark it up, but once it lit it stayed lit fairly well. Doesnt burn as well as the current stuff though

**Body/Nic:** More full bodied than the current, with about the same amount of nicotine, maybe slightly less. Body ramps up as you smoke and peaks at about the halfway point

**taste:** Nothing like the current production. The first 1/4 of the bowl is honestly not great, it has a lot of funkyness that is probably from all of the age and maybe fermentation. Also very spicy in the mouth and retrohale

Taste gets much better toward the halfway point, with a lot of sweetness and dark fruit. spicyness is still about the same. Slight woodsyness and a bit of complexity with unique flavors i can't put my finger on

After the halfway point at about 3/4s of the bowl it starts to degenerate into a bit of that original funkyness and loses the sweetness. Slight dark fruit and woodsyness are still there though and still spicy and full bodied.

Putting the pipe down now a bit past 3/4. Most of the flavor is drowned out and its just very spicy and funky and wants to go out.

**Overall Thoughts:** The tobacco starts off a bit bad but is very tasty, complex and unique from 20%-70% of the bowl.

I like it, but not for the same reasons that i like the current RY, and i wouldnt give up my current RY for this version. To me, the current stuff is great because it burns well and tastes good throughout the whole bowl and is just a great well balanced smoke for my tastes. 

I will probably pop this jar open and smoke it occasionally, and to let other try

**TL;DR:** Its good and i'm glad i tried it, but i still like the current stuff more
====================================
FreestateFreehand: I'm really glad it showed up safe and then popped nice and fresh for you!  Kind of a bummer it didn't knock your socks off but I'm happy you still enjoyed it. Great write-up!

mrubni: Thanks. I got legit excited watching you pop that tin. I'd always heard that the newer RY isn't quite the same as the old stuff. Interesting to hear that the newer versions might be more consistent. Or maybe it just doesn't age as well as some blends. 

I've been working through some backlog of blends I enjoy but don't love; I think i need to seal them back up and pop some more Royal Yacht!

drnickfury: I love the old Dunhill logo. I wonder how the new stuff will hold up in decades to come.

wangchung80: Thanks for the post. I’ve been on the fence about popping my vintage tin from the late 70’s. Have to admit I was a little sad with the report. I was sincerely hoping for better news.

Zapotecorum: Dont get me wrong - its not *bad*. It just didnt blow my socks off. Plus, ive only smoked one bowl, so take my review with a grain of salt

wangchung80: Be sure to follow up on your progression through the tin. I have a vested interest in your opinion. Thanks!

oispa: Sounds amazing. This blend is a favorite. Would love to taste it from 1912-present.
