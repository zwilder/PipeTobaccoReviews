Review of mystery tobacco sent by /u/ChefPD

Recently I did a tobacco trade with /u/ChefPD.  Unfortunately I don't have a list of the lovely tobaccos he sent me and I'm away from them now, but suffice to say, Pierre trades like a beast!  He sent the tobaccos that I wanted, and then proceeds to bomb the ever living hell out of me!  (But he did include a love letter...so that was a nice "kiss" before he had is way with me.  Ha!

Anyway, he included a mystery tobacco sample that he asked me to review.  So, here goes...

**Mystery Sample initial assessment:**

Tangy! I don't recall ever having a tobacco before that was this tangy. It was the predominant note for me throughout the smoke.

Backing the crisp, tangy blast was a throat punch of spice. Like eating great Mexican food I couldn't stop going back for more even though my mouth was on fire.

I got enough of a smokey note from it I started to question whether or not there might be a condiment portion of KFC in there, but I think it was just actually a healthier dose of perique than I'm used to so I think I was getting some smokey richness from it. Usually I just get sweet or spicy from perique, so if I'm right this was new experience for me.

I'm guessing a straight VaPer of some kind. The Virginias tasted so crisp and tangy that I wonder if it wasn't largely yellow Virginia based, but the tobacco was so dark in color that if it was, it would have had to have been aged / stoved for some time prior to being sold.

Am I in the ballpark or am I talking out my ass? Ha! To be fair, I've only had one bowl and it was on a somewhat rushed break.

Enjoyable smoke. I can see this one being great for a hot summer night. The Nicotine crept up on me (to be fair, I'm a lightweight with the Nic) pretty fast so I'm thinking this would be a good bowl in the evening time.

Thank you so much for the generous samples and the opportunity to push myself to taste something without having a preconceived notion about it!  Let's do this again Pierre.
====================================
ChefPD: Very much in the ballpark. It's a va/per, but with orientals, yenidje to be specific. Red virginia's, stoved and raw, then pressed into flakes and broken (but not rubbed). It's definitely got a good bit of perique in it, which is what you're tasting when you questioned the kentucky content. Any guesses anyone? 

I can say that if I received the tobacco, I would know there was something extra, but I'm not too familiar with orientals and I doubt I could've placed my finger on it. When this post is a few hours old, I'll name the blend if anyone hasn't guessed it by then. 

**EDIT:** It's Tudor Castle!

ChefPD: Edited my comment.

DenverTele: Damn...

I briefly wondered if some of the tang was from some orientals, but then thought that was probably crazy and that I was reaching.

It had just enough of a wine / tea type of tannin to it that I questioned it.

hedonaut: Almost sounds like Orion's Arrow, though that also has some bright ribbon in it as well. 

EDIT: And I think that's Izmir

tennesseean_87: You think he put Kentucky Fried Chicken in the pipe tobacco?
