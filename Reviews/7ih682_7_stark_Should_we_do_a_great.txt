Should we do a great blind review swap?

One of the other pipe boards I frequent does a blind review swap. Basically, it works like this:

* I send you some samples. Let’s say I send you three small bags of randomly selected pipe tobacco.
* You send me three samples.
* We each smoke the samples, not knowing exactly what they are. 
* We post reviews of each sample, trading off. So I would review your Sample #1, maybe take a guess at what it is, and you then post the big reveal. You now review my Sample #1, and we continue until all six samples have been reviewed.

This tends to work best when someone is making sure the whole thing stays on track, and that no more than 2 to maybe 4 people are posting blind swaps at any given time. But I’m not one to impose too many rules, and lord knows I don’t have time to manage a centralized list. So let’s see if there is any interest, and we can go from there.

If people are already doing this here, forgive my ignorance. If not, should we play?
====================================
LizMixsMoker: Sounds fun, anyone up for it in central Europe? Would make things cheaper in terms of shipping

Wollivan: I'm in the UK, and I'd be up for it, but I wouldn't have much to offer in the way of unique blends or rare samples, and my reviews would be 'yep, this is tobacco, and when I lit it, it burnt' but I'd do my best!
--
7_stark: The samples don’t need to be rare. In fact, half the fun of it is sending run of the mill drugstore blends someone’s way, and watching him fret over whatever rare gold he imagines he is tasting. :)
--
Wollivan: In that case definitely count me in! Even if we just do one blend, that sounds really fun, so 3 would be insane!

Super_Maxco: I could be up for the challenge, based in northern Europe. Good to know we're not all US based.

NathanielCrunkleton: Down for this if anyone wants to do low-dollar blends; have just started smoking and have been thriving off of the store blends local to me.  I'm in Dayton OH.

====================================
ThePipeSigh: That'd be fun. I'd do it.

====================================
misterzipp0: I'd like to see this take place.  I barely have time to get a bowl of my own choosing in lately but I'd love to watch the madness :-)

====================================
Dadgy: I'd be interested.

====================================
7_stark: Update: I think we should decentralize this. People can essentially pair off at will. Message me directly if you are US based and interested in trying this out with me. For the time being, it’s easier for me to ship tobacco samples without having to worry about customs and shipping delays.
