[Review] Briarworks Signature Line Mag-Top Briar Calabash
By: ChefPD
---
Briarworks International. At the helm are Todd M. Johnson and Pete Prevost, two very skilled American pipe makers who wanted to bring back the American factory pipe in a way that could compete with other factory and handmade pipes alike. There’s a lot more to know about this company, and if you’d like to read more, I suggest checking out their website [here.](http://briarworksintl.com/)

This review will be on the Briarworks Signature Line Mag-top Calabash. I bought mine in early December 2015, so with my limited use, I am writing what I would call a preliminary review. In time, everything I’ve written may not hold true, but as my pipe is new to me and the line of pipes is fairly new to everyone, there is no way of knowing, yet. 

I like the pipe review template collaborated on by the whole sub about a year ago, so that’s what I’ll use. If you want a blank template for your own pipe review, check the sidebar ->

**Brand/History:** Briarworks Intl. History mentioned above and linked. Lots of stuff going on with this company, and a little too much for this review without creating a wall of text, which I will do, regardless.

**Shape/Shape Number:** Briar Calabash

**Purchase Information:** I bought this one from eBay, unsmoked, from Chance over at great estate pipes. Very pleasant transaction, he’s a great eBay estate seller. I recommend following his auctions. I paid $350, but this may or may not be representative, even as unsmoked, it was on the estate market at auction. $350 is what that specific market decided for it’s worth, even though it’s normally $500 for the model I have. I will review it as a new pipe and assume I paid full price, to make it fair.

**Materials:** Bowl: Briar, Condensation Chamber/Shank: Briar, Ferrule: White acrylic, Stem: Black acrylic

**Finish:** Dark smooth, one step below their light smooth finish, which means this grain was A, not A+.  No fills. Grain is excellent. Very little birdseye on the bottom, but heaps of flame grain ascending from the heel to the bowl and the shank. Stem and bowl both are a good fit, but not flush to account for all the variations of accent diameters, stem diameters (dome, saddle, flare, etc) and to allow for the bowl to rest on the magnets without interference, however, unnoticeable unless you look for it. The smooth finish is comparable to a high grade handmade pipe from Todd, Pete, or any other. It’s excellent, not a spot of uneven staining, sanding marks, dull spots, nada, nothing. The bowl came pre-treated with a simple bowl coat, which helps foster cake, a fairly standard practice now-a-days. The way the grain is oriented is important, very much so, in fact. The way it’s a perfect cut tells me this piece of briar was not just thrown onto a machine and cut any which way. It was carefully inspected for grain orientation and cut therefrom. Same goes for the Briarworks blowfish, but that’s a different review. The bowl is held in place by 3 earth magnets (neodymium, I assume), and sealed by a foam ring inserted at the top of the chamber. This, of course, has the advantage of changing out bowls (new bowls are $100 a pop) for different variations or for different blends. Everything works harmoniously here, simple to remove, but reliable when it’s attached. 

**Drilling:** Drilling has to be good on a pipe like this. If you mess it up, you may not have made a proper calabash! There’s a hole in the bottom of the bowl, and the chamber has been hollowed out to the heel, where it takes a turn, meets the draught hole and eventually the mortise. That said, the drilling is perfect, namely the condensation chamber. I think some of it was done by machine, but then at the bottom you can see some was done by hand. It must be incredibly difficult to hollow out a conically curved piece of briar, in a uniform way, over, and over again. But they’ve done it, and done it well. No complaints there. From the first smoke to the most recent, no whistling, no airflow issues with the bowl being detachable. The draw is open, not too loose, and not too tight. 

**Ergonomics/Weight:** *This* right here is what makes this pipe, to me, so special. It’s a moderately substantial pipe, weighing in at 2.2 oz, and all the weight being on the end furthest from your face. Sounds awkward, heavy, uncomfortable, and unwieldy. So, so wrong. The bend in the stem, first of all, lets the pipe hang bowl-parallel to your lower lip/chin area, instead of at an angle. While the bowl is the heaviest bit, it’s not actually that far from your mouth. If you were eliminate the bend, this would be classified as a nosewarmer, and lo, it behaves like one! So darn comfortable to clench, which really surprised the living hell out of me, if I’m honest. To make it simple, it just hangs beautifully. 

**Size (taken from smokingpipes.com, but it’s pretty standard):** 

* Length: 5.29 in./134.37 mm.

* Weight: 2.20 oz./62.37 g.

* Bowl Height: 1.45 in./36.83 mm.

* Chamber Depth: 1.13 in./28.70 mm.

* Chamber Diameter: 0.68 in./17.27 mm.

* Outside Diameter: 1.93 in./49.02 mm.


**The Smoke:** Wonderful, for a short smoke. 15 minutes on the very outside, 10 minutes if you smoke fairly fast like I do (*see edit). The one downside is these bowls’ depth/diameters are 1.125” x 0.68”. It’s a small bowl, and that’s by design, of course, but still a factor to consider when looking at these pipes. If you wanted to have something bigger, you’d have a much bigger calabash, and in that respect, I’m happy to compromise on bowl size for an overall pipe size that anyone should be happy with. The condensation chamber definitely does its’ job. Once you remove the bowl after a smoke, you’ll notice a lot of moisture, and I do mean dripping wet. This is the benefit of any traditional calabash, the tobacco can burn freely above the moisture and not have to suffer from it. Noticeable in the smoke, but not necessarily scads better than a smoke from a non-calabash pipe. Take that as you will, but that’s what I noticed. 

**Overall:** I would recommend it if you’re very sure it’s what you’re looking for. It is a short smoke, and it’s not at an entry-level price. This does not mean it’s not worth the $300-550 price tag, it just means you’re paying premium, and while you can expect the product the reflect the price appropriately, it’s still a wad of cash for most people. Part of what makes this not your standard gourd calabash is the quality and time that goes into making it. Does the chamber need to be briar? No, it has it’s benefits, but I don’t believe, from what knowledge I have about condensation chambers, need to be briar. That ties into the price, you’re getting something that’s very **nice**. This is a luxury item, not your everyday knockaround pipe. As a side note, I’d like to embarrass myself and say that I was surprised by the quality of this pipe, simply because it’s a factory pipe, but that was naive of me, because the design, as well as the name behind the design, is proven and the whole process is curated by some very talented, capable minds (and hands).

**EDIT:** I'm sure you can push the smoke over 15 minutes, I smoke rubbed out flakes that are fairly dried out, not bone dry, and I smoke quickly. Still, it's definitely on the small bowl/quick smoke side of things. Not to be overlooked.

====================================
mk_bway: Awesome review and an awesome looking pipe. I'm sure the pics don't quite do it justice, but they still make it look amazing.
--
ChefPD: Agreed, this camera does a good job, but it's not professional and the lighting is wicked. Looks so much better in hand than on site. Glad you liked the review!
--
====================================
soymilkisgood: Nice detailed review overall, man. I held these at Chicago and Las Vegas and they're damn nice. But a 10-15 minute smoke out of that bowl? Dude you are smoking too fast and/or not using the right type of tobacco. Pack a nice flake or plug in that chamber and you should get at least 45 mins to an hour out of it. 
--
crimsonrat: Honestly I could see where I'd get max 30. I'd have to pick one up again. I smoke fast, as well, though. 
--
soymilkisgood: Eh I'll have to measure my smaller pipes when I get home and see. Maybe I'm just a really slow smoker, I don't know. 
--
ChefPD: I've been smoking Sir John flake in it, about a medium pack, and quickly. I'll pack it much tighter and see how long I can draw out the smoke. My smoking speed probably won't change though, I don't like smoking slowly.
--
ChefPD: I usually smoke flakes, I could try packing tighter, but any more than I do usually is too much for me and I have a tight draw. Thanks, glad you liked the review. Seeing as you have that eltang bash and probably some others, this probably isn't necessary for you, but you wouldn't regret having one either, I imagine.
--
soymilkisgood: Yeah idk I have to compare it with my smaller bowled pipes I guess. I rarely get less than 45 mins out of any bowl I have, and I have small ones. And yes although I probably won't be getting one of these myself, the review is well done and helpful for anyone that might be thinking about it. ;)
--
====================================
ajpl: Thanks for the review!

I've had my eye on these for a while, but for my money they just aren't worth their price-point. I'm more than happy to spend a lot on a well-made pipe, but these feel like they should be in the $200-300 range rather than topping out at $500 for the smooth finish. So congratulations on snagging one for a reasonable price!
--
ChefPD: I know exactly what you mean, it would have been a good while longer until I shelled out full price for one of these, if forced to. Although if $300 is your limit, [Chance (the same guy I got it from) has another one up on his eBay right now, unsmoked, and it will very likely go under your mark.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-UNSMOKED-BRIARWORKS-TODD-JOHNSON-SIGNATURE-CALABASH-AMERICAN-ARTISAN-Pipe-/201496353281?hash=item2eea1e5a01:g:iLQAAOSwGotWifaa)
--
ajpl: I just watched that one. Thanks!

I don't love the black finish on these but I can settle for this one if the price ends up being good. We'll have to wait and see!
--
ChefPD: I know briarworks will replace the stem for free, if it's unsmoked. They will probably replace the bowl if it's unsmoked, too. Small chance they might replace the whole chamber for you, but somehow I doubt it. You could always contact them, Rita is the one to email about that.
--
pylorns: meh, dont like the color/option/finish.  But I bet he'll have more. 
--
====================================
PhysicsNovice: Im not sure how I feel about the smoke being so short. It would be nice for pipe club and pipe events where Im bouncing around from blend to blend. Maybe as a taster. But that's a helluva price tag for a taster. 
--
ChefPD: I gave my results, ymmv, and as a fast smoker, my time may be half of what others can get, *but* still a fast smoke. Thanks for reading.
--
====================================
pylorns: Love it.  I want one, and you seriously lucked out at 350 for it, considering. I've bought a Radice from Chance and got a hell of a deal and it smokes like a champ too - can't say enough about him as an ebay seller.  I think my only gripe is the same as /u/soymilkisgood the bowl size is a bit off putting, but I still want one lol.
--
ChefPD: If you like the black blast with light blasted bowl, Chance has another unsmoked one on his eBay right now if you're in the market. I already linked it above, but now I feel like I'm pitting two redditors against each other over a pipe, haha. It was definitely a good deal, kinda shows you what most people are really willing to pay for it, which is kind of understandable. Yes, I tied in bowl size to my overall review, but it's essentially the only downside I found, unless you count price...
--
pylorns: i need to look now...
--
====================================
None: Cool pipe, the magnet thing is slick, but if I had $300+ to drop on a Calabash it would be a gourd with meerschaum bowl.
--
ChefPD: Ya Fikri Baki is still on my list, but now that I have a bit more of a plan for my collection, he's much further down the line. If I could just have one really good meerschaum, it'd be one of his, and that'd be enough. 

The magnet is a really good idea. Good move on making modular pipes on their part.
--
====================================
pipeCrow: Thanks for the review. It sounds pretty similar to the Huge Stone briar calabash I got... hangs nicely, short smoke, though it's just a traditional plain cork ring holding the bowl, not some kind of magnets.
