I don't usually subribe to days for particular types of pipes but as it so happens I'm smoking my Falcons today and it happens to be Friday. I usually have three bowls a day and today is no exeption but, I'm using my Falcon pipes. So far I've smoked both of my Falcon Hunters one with Gawith Hogarth Balkan Mixture the other with Mac Baren Vanilla Cream which I've just finished and lovely it was to. This afternoon I shall be smoking my bent Falcon International with some Condor Long Cut I'm looking forward to that.

Do you have a Falcon that needs attention that needs smoking well it's Friday what are you waiting for break it out and smoke the bugger. Happy smoking.
====================================
mrsir79: I haven't smoked my falcon in months (enjoying a meerschaum lately) but tonight will be a metal stem night!  Probably with some C&D monster mix.
--
Dai7: I have a meerschaum bowl for mine but I need to use it more often.
--
mrsir79: I keep watching ebay for  a meerschaum one and also a morta bowl.  I get a little worried though when it says adapter may be required.  I don't think I've ever seen an adapter between threads.  But I'd hate to pay $50 or more for a morta bowl and then find out it wouldn't fit.

--
Dai7: Send this guy a message he does morta bowls for Falcons, Don't know how much he charges though.

boomermax: Was going to suggest the same.  Love mine.

====================================
unigami: My first Falcon is waiting for me at home in my mailbox.  I can't wait to try it out!
--
Dai7: Don't forget when you get a third of the way down the bowl to unscrew it and wipe it out with paper tissue the put your bowl back on and carry on smoking.
--
unigami: That would be kinda annoying...if I have to do that, I'll start putting a section of pipe cleaner in there to soak it up.

He explains the Falcon well.

unigami: Thanks!  I'm really happy with my pipe, it is an estate from ebay  and it's in good shape.  I cleaned it up and I'm already smoking my first bowl.  I love it!
--
Dai7: Another Falcon convert, way to go.

Formaldehydeontoast: I've only ever used falcons, I actually wouldnt recommend the dry rings. I've found that fact the oils/liquid are condensed in the bottom taints the taste of the smoke and makes it a bit harsher on the tongue, it is better to just unscrew and wipe out every so often. After wiping however, you get a moment of 'MMMM there's that tasty tobacco'.
--
unigami: Thanks, I will try it without the dry ring.  I noticed that the dry ring turned black in one section where I suppose it got burnt and I don't want to be tasting that either.
--
Formaldehydeontoast: Don't sweat it! Because of the large draught hole in the bowls occasionally little bits of tobacco fall in there too, its not a perfect system, but I find the pro's outweigh the limitations.

====================================
beaker75: Falcon friday here as well! Mac B's Golden Blend in a classic straight Falcon with algiers bowl for breakfast. International bent stem with dover bowl in the afternoon for some De Luxe Navy Rolls. Yummy. 
--
Dai7: way to go.

====================================
SwampGentleman: Maybe this is the wrong spot to ask, but I am curious. I would love to learn all that I can.

The stems on falcons tend to be made of aluminum, right? I have some concern about the risk of heating aluminum and bringing the fumes so close, due to dementia ties. Dementia scares the crap out of me. 

Does anybody have knowledge which counters my fears? I just want to pretend I'm Jung and carry a falcon around all day.

(Alternatively... near the end of his life, Jung himself carried his pipe and only pretended to smoke it for something to do, as his doctor forbade him from actually smoking)
--
Formaldehydeontoast: I can't say anything about the biochemistry of it but the stems on falcons (should) never get too hot to hold, the hottest mine has ever gotten was about the same a hot bath and that was only the sump. AFAIK aluminium is completely unaffected by that degree of heat.
--
SwampGentleman: Ah! That does make sense. Thank you!

--
Dai7: I don't think you need worry about fumes from the Aluminium. Think frying pans they are made from aluminium. If there were fumes from the aluminium they would of known about it by now Falcons have been in production since the 1930's. I'm sure you'll be pretty safe using a Falcon. You have a much bigger chance of getting dimentia through processed food than from your Falcon.
