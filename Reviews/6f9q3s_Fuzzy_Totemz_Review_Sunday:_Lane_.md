Review Sunday: Lane Dark Red

Lane Dark Red is the Black Cav component of Blood Red Moon.  (I think)  
   
This is a similar to BCA in profile except that it's got a sharp note from the cherry/cocoa dressing.  
  
I recently reviewed BCA:
https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/6cpyjm/review_lane_bca/  
  
If you want a fun review, read that one. This one is "here it is". For BlackCav smokes, BCA is the real king for Lane. I see Dark Red as being preferred by people who like the Cherry/Cocoa profile. Dark Red is a mixing tobacco as well. **I mixed some with FireDance Flake and the result was better than the components.**  
  
If you like Blood Red Moon (which some speculate is TK-6 in overpriced tin format), you've smoked this (probably).  
  
I don't believe in stars or numbers. This review simply tells you what I thought. It was enjoyable but more enjoyable blended. I would not smoke this again on it's own (versus BCA).  
====================================
coldsolderjoint: Ut oh, I was looking forward to the dark red, but BRM wasn't my favorite. 

I think I'm more of just cherry or cherry vanilla type. 

Although I just opened a pouch of Casey Jones last ride and enjoyed the Carmel profile
