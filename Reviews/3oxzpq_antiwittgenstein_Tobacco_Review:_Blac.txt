Review # 52

**Blend Name:**McClellands Blackwoods Flake

**Description on Tin:** The natural sweetness of mellow, red Virginias mingles inextricably with the richness and inherent spicy aroma of Black Stoved Virginias in the this doubly-aged red and black all-Virginia cake mixture.
 
**Leaf:** Irregular flake, some almost factory perfect, some broken, all of it very black (as the name would make you hope) with some light streaks

**Tin Aroma:** McCatsup. Worcestershire sauce. Hay. Old house in the summer – like dried roses. Earth. Anise. Rain on loam. 

**Taste:** Toast. A bit of twang on the exhale, a burst of orange red in the smoke. A lingering vague spice. Worcestershire sauce. No, rich, tomatoey, like Heinz 57, or ketchup with a bit of HP sauce mixed in. Salty. This is one McClelland blend where the tin note comes in on the taste – I happen to enjoy it, but if you don’t, you have been warned. Vinegar, with a bit of a fruit, either red wine or cider. Some hearty hay, almost like oatmeal. Rippling complexity on the exhale, fruity cider, salty and spicy. A citrus sneaks in, but is pretty faint for a Va flake. Long plummy notes start up, mixing with the vinegar, notes of orange and lemons strengthen. Sweet-spicy-savoury-salty-tangy all at once. Perfect. Beef jerky. Damn it I have to buy another tin of this immediately. It’s okay, I’m not gonna have any grandkids anyway. Towards the end of the bowl deeper, darker, more plummy, au jus on medium rare steak. I want another bowl of this immediately.

**Nicotine:** Not that strong.

**Smokability:** Smokes as easy as Carter Hall. It is never wet and never goes out.

**Smokability, this time with the sarcasm:** This is probably the best tasting tobacco I have had – it speaks to me on a spiritual level – but it is the worst performing tobacco as well. When you open the tin it is wet. If you dry it out for a day or two it is still wet. What I did was dry the whole tin out on paper towels for a week. Then it was still wet. So I forgot about it for a year. Now it smokes okay. Don’t try to stuff and fold, I roughly rip the pieces apart and gravity feed. The tobacco is so dense that even a half bowl lasts 45 minutes. Rumor has it that if you microwave it for 7 seconds it will smoke just fine, but I haven’t tried that yet – I will when I attack its kin, Dark Star. If you are a fan of Firedance or FVF or the other famously wet flakes, you should be able to tackle this one. This was the 1st flake I bought. That was a mistake.

**Room Note:** Honestly I am always too enraptured to note this one, but I would guess, warm tobacco.

**Thoughts:** This is the best Virginia flake I have smoked. Yes I have had Stonehaven. Full Virginia Flake. Orlik Golden Sliced. It is bright and savoury and peppery and just the right amount of sweet. Complex, it develops but loops back around the same flavours again and again. 

There is a popular consensus that when baseball starts up, spring scrubs the sleep out of its eyes and everything it warm and cheerful, it is time to pull out the Virginia – Golden flakes that perfect that porch rocking or picnic, gentle and warm. And that when the storm shutters go on and the year’s night comes you put away such bright tobaccos in favor of Latakia and Oriental. But this is not a gentle lemonade kind of flake. Blackwoods is made for dusk and autumn and the mornings of frosted breath. It is somber and gaunt. It is not without sweetness, but it is tempered with darkness in every puff. If Orlik Golden Sliced is Beethoven, this is heavy, metal infused prog rock. And yes it is impossible to smoke easily. But even taking points off for difficulties, it still gets a perfect score.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Full Virginia Flake.

**Summary:** A complex, dark, full flavored Virginia-Asbestos flake perfect for cold autumn evenings .

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 3 years, and entered the world of pipes about 1 and a half years ago. My current top three are: Blackwoods, Orlik Golden Sliced, and Dunhill 965.

====================================
TDKerabotsos: Awesome review of my all-time favorite blend!
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! Now that I know how to smoke it, is my number one too.
--
====================================
pixeechick: That was poetic. I really can't wait to try that one.
--
antiwittgenstein: Thanks! When I reorder I can send you a sample. This last flake is all mine.
--
pixeechick: That's kind of you. I will happily send you some samples of the McC stuff here you're asking about as well. 
--
====================================
None: Just opened up my tin and now kicking myself for not buying a 100g tin. *Sigh, signs onto p&c* (though I should've known, given my paranormal abilities)
--
====================================
BWeice: I bought a tin 4 months ago to try and by try I mean have it sit on my shelf looking all pretty for a couple months to age instead of getting 2 tins so I have one to try fresh.. I'll learn.

Sounds fantastic I can't wait to pop it open!
--
====================================
chewsyourownadv: It sounds nice. I've been on the fence about whether to pick some up at my local shop, as I'm practically swimming in Christmas Cheer right now. Have you tried CC? If so, how do you think they compare?

Edit: And I you rated it in terms of my favorite band. Nevermind, I guess it must be bought, now.
--
antiwittgenstein: Always glad to enable. I haven't had any CC yet - but I have a sudden itch to grab a tin of 2015. Have you seen Godspeed Live? They opened for NIN a year back and were incredible, they played all of *Mladic* which was the album I keep thinking of when I smoke Blackwoods.
--
chewsyourownadv: Oh, it's been somewhere between 10 and 15 years since I saw them in New Orleans. It was a dive-ish, not very large venue and I got to hangout close to the stage. They played mostly songs from Raise Your Skinny Fists, and had someone working a video projector to go with the songs. They're talented performers, having managed all of their songs on stage the way it sounds on the album.
--
====================================
Eighchops: I was going to upvote for Godspeed but the Black album? Good?  Eh, fuck it, have an upvote anyway (and put Puppets back on).
--
antiwittgenstein: There is a bit of nostalgia there - Master of Puppets, And Justice for All are clearly superior, but they don't have the word Black in their title.
--
====================================
cgrd: Have you tried McClelland's "Tudor Castle"? If so, how does it compare?
--
antiwittgenstein: No I haven't, but does it seem similar? 
--
cgrd: Here's my review of it from a few years back. There does seem to be similarities. Perhaps Tudor Castle is just a little "lighter" in its flavours?

>This is my first flake tobacco, and it's a broken flake. I used the "Cutting into Cubes" method as demonstrated [here](http://pipesmagazine.com/blog/pipe-videos/flake-pipe-tobacco-preparation-videos/). The tobacco was very moist, almost sticky. After I cut it, I let it dry for a couple of hours.

>It was the easiest pipe load so far; I just dumped in the cut and let gravity settle the tobacco. A few taps against the side of the bowl and I was set.

>The tobacco took the char easily, and lit just as well. A clean grey ash formed on top, and I settled in for the smoke; in my [Mastersen's "Cut 29"](http://i.imgur.com/keIYz.jpg) it took about an hour and twenty minutes. Throughout the smoke, I got the taste and smell of prunes, black pepper, damp alfalfa hay, blackstrap molasses, nag champa, hard wood smoke, and allspice. A small amount of dottle was left in the very bottom of the bowl (it tapers quite a bit), but the remainder burned to a fine ash. I relight twice.

>It was a satisfying and dense smoke, and remained interesting throughout the bowl and at times, the flavours bordered on overwhelming. That's not a knock against it in any sense, it was, in fact, the perfect smoke for a cool, cloudy evening where I had the time to just let the world pass me by.

>The tin states this is a blend that is designed to age, so I'll go back to it from time to time over the next year to see what changes.
--
antiwittgenstein: Sounds pretty akin. I will have to take a look the next time I TAD.
--
====================================
xDemagog: Good luck with Dark Star, it's a bitch to get going properly. 
--
antiwittgenstein: I opened it a week or two back. I just left the lid off. If needs be I will build a vacuum chamber for it.
--
xDemagog: It's an interesting blend once you get it going. I recommend rubbing it out as fine as you can. My only complaint with McClelland flakes is that they're typically small and thick which makes them a bitch to rub out, still super tasty flakes though. My favorite is St. James Woods.
