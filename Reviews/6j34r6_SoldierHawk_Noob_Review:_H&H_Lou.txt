Noob Review: H&H Louisiana Red

**[This is my first attempt at any kind of a tobacco review, and I'm pretty new in terms of smoking too, so it won't be the most nuanced or deep or eloquent. With that in mind, feedback welcome!]**

Disclaimer: I am pretty new to the hobby, so my palette and vocabulary aren't the most developed. This is more an exercise in developing than than an actual attempt at a 'you should/shouldn't buy this tobacco' kind of review. 


**H&H Louisiana Red**

Blend Type: Virginia/Perique

Contents: Perique, Virginia

Flavoring: None

Cut: Ribbon


So, I'm mostly an English fan (I love me some latakia--dat smokiness doe, yes please!), but I've also grown to love Virginias, ESPECIALLY the VaPers; Dunhill Elizabethan Mix is one of my longtime staples, and my instant go-to when I'm not feeling like latakia. 

While browsing around P&C for no good reason (apparently my wallet was too heavy, I don't freakin' know why I do these things you guys), I stumbled upon the page for Louisiana Red. I instantly bought a tin to try, for three very good reasons, in the following order:

* I'm a sucker for Southern Bayou culture, and the blend was called Louisiana Red
* It had sweet H&H tin art
* I needed to expand my VaPer horizon beyond a single blend

Well, it arrived a few days later, and I happily cracked the tin. The smell got me right away--DEFINITELY different from my old reliable Elizabethan Mix. That smells kind of...gentle, refined, polite. Louisiana Red grabs you by the collar and announces itself the second you take a whiff: strong, sweet and spicy. 

I probably should have let it dry just a little, as it was just a tad damp right out of the tin (I tend to go drier rather than not, as I'm still mastering the art of even lighting and keeping my pipe lit easily) but after smelling it, I couldn't wait. As it happened, that wasn't a terrible decision; though the initial charring light was a bit challenging, once that was done and things had settled it was very well behaved from there, and lit and smoked with ease. 

Like the smell, the taste was absolutely unlike the one VaPer I've had experience with. Where Elizabethan Mix is the refined friend you'd have over for tea, Louisiana Red is the buddy you invite over when it's time to go traipsing through the woods hunting hogs: loud, strong, impossible to ignore, and one HELL of a lot of fun. (Also, would probably be improved with the addition of beer to the equation.) 

While there's very little, if any, smokiness to the flavor, it's the bright-hot spiciness that instantly grabbed (and held) my attention. I honestly wasn't sure if I liked it in the first five minutes; it was almost overwhelming. I'm not sure if it was me getting used to the taste, or the blend itself mellowing a bit as I smoked, but after 5-10 minutes I was able to settle in and ride that wave of spice and pick out the very, very pleasant sweetness underneath. Once that mellowing occurred, it went from what felt like a flavor punch in the mouth to something that. against my expectations, was actually quite light. There was definitely a strong, spicy/peppery undercurrent the whole time (one that's not present for me in Elizabethan Mix), but it was far from overwhelming, and balanced with the sweetness quite beautifully in the end. 

Overall, I would give this mix a very solid 4/5. It's going into my main rotation. To me, this feels like a wonderful 'every day' VaPer blend that is strong enough in flavor to smoke the same day as my Englishes, without having the heaviness that they do. A new staple for my collection.

PeskyPrussian: Nice review! Thanks for doing it. I'm always happy when people take the time and effort to write up good, detailed reviews.

SoldierHawk: Thank you!

misterzipp0: This is a fantastic review, I really enjoy analogies and the journey through a bowl.  Please keep it up, we have far too few reviewers here!

Louisiana Red was my first VaPer, and Perique is a great tobacco that can take on a few different flavors.  

If you haven't had Anniversary Kake yet let I suggest trying it next, that will introduce you to the chocolate spice Perique can bring.

SoldierHawk: Really! I've heard so much about AnniCake but have never tried it! 

I've blown my immediate tobacco budget on Stonehenge (I bought the hype...), but I may WELL make that my next tin. I'd been debating anyway, but you just sold me! 

And thank you for the kind words as well <3

misterzipp0: I think I've got a fair amount, I'll check when I get home, PM me your address and I'll get some in the mail to you.
--
SoldierHawk: Wait...really? Are you sure? Isn't it pretty rare stuff?
--
misterzipp0: Rare? No... Folks are stockpiling it and they can't keep up with demand, but it gets released a lot more often than something like Stonehaven.

crimblade: Nice review! My only comment is to not worry so much about being new to the review game! It's good to make note of how long you've been piping because that does affect how you perceive the blends but other than that don't worry about it so much!

I've had this one in my cart several times and never actually gotten it but from the sounds of it I need to stop putting it off it sounds great! I actually just tried Bayou Morning Flake by C&D, initial impression is it's delicious, from your review it would probably be right up your alley.
--
SoldierHawk: Absolutely give it a try! It'll be well worth your while! 

I'll absolutely add Bayou Morning to my wish list. Can't wait to try it. 

And thank you for the kind words <3. More reviews will be forthcoming I'm sure!
