[Review] L. J. Peretti - D-9575
By: Old_Deadhead
---
**Name:** D-9575

**Type:** English (American English)

**Leaf:** Burley, Latakia, Virginia

**Blender’s Description:** Here is a blend that combines the rich English flavors of Latakia and fire-cured Virginia, plus a Burley base for coolness. It's smooth and spicy with a slight sweet tang.

**Old Deadhead’s Opinion:** L. J. Peretti has been around since 1870, and their experience and expertise are evident in their blends. D-9575 is one of four one-ounce samples that come in their “Hybrid Blend” sampler, which are all “American” Englishes. The base of this rather generically named blend is burley, a tobacco for which Peretti is famous. My review was smoked in a [fairly standard sized billiard of my own creation](https://www.reddit.com/r/pipemaking/comments/6qshzt/3rd_pipe_a_billiard/). 



The cut is Peretti’s version of a ribbon cut. It’s a bit chunkier than what I most often associate with a ribbon cut, presumably because it’s all cut by hand. Unfortunately, I neglected to take a picture of this blend, and I blissfully smoked my sample away before realizing it would be beneficial to include a photo with the review. An oversight I’ll try not to make in future reviews. Being comprised of larger bits, it lends itself to a simple drizzle into the bowl, followed by a very mild tamp. This one likes to have some room to breath. Do give this a little bit of dry time out of the jar, 20 minutes or so. 

Tin note is sweet, a blend of burley and latakia. The charring light is pure Burley; nutty, earthy, and of obvious quality with no hint of casing. Once lit, as the ember begins to grow, the taste alters between sweet, slightly tangy Virginia, and a smoky, musky Latakia. Neither is overpowering, but the interplay is enjoyable, each making itself known as the bits and pieces are consumed. 

It quickly settles into a flavor that will continue through the rest of the bowl. While the burley is definitely the predominant taste, the Virginia and Latakia perform their essential supporting roles to make a very consistent, enjoyable smoke. Although the flavor never changes dramatically, to call it monotone would be to do it a grave disservice. I might get a fleeting taste of clover honey, then it’s gone, replaced by a bit of smoky goodness, all the while carried by the backbone of smooth burley. 

There’s no bite, and it is very forgiving of puffing cadence. Can easily be a set it and forget it smoke. While it may require a few relights, there’s no off-taste with a relight, something I notice in some English blends. Burns into mostly a white ash, with a few clumps of coal remaining, but no moisture.

The nicotine level is moderate. While it wasn’t present enough to make me really conscious of it, by the end of the bowl, my cares had certainly vanished. 

**Summary:** A fantastic smoke, especially for Burley lovers. Could easily be enjoyed any time of the day, and multiple times a day, if so desired. I plan on immediately ordering 8 oz of this, which comes in Peretti’s metal paint cans, and stashing at least some away to see how it ages.

**4.5/5** 

Scale:

5/5: This is Heaven, man!!

4/5: This deserves to be in my regular rotation

3/5: I'd probably revisit this at some point

2/5: Well, that was...interesting

1/5: WTF did I just smoke? 



====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nice write up. The Fiancee approves of your writing style. Did you want this marked as part of the contest?
--
Old_Deadhead: Sure, might as well. I've not had the opportunity to try Stonehaven yet, so it will be nice if it works out. 

Either way, it got me to start righting reviews, which is something I've been meaning to do, so thanks!

====================================
HandsomeRalphy: Nice write up. Just had placed my Peretti order on Weds, and unfortunatley this one isn't on the list. Oh well, guess I need to make sure I stop by the shop when I head home for the holidays! 
--
Old_Deadhead: I really want to make a pilgrimage to their shop! I've got several more 1oz samples headed my way. 
--
HandsomeRalphy: It's a great old school tobacco shop. You will get PAD/TAD overload. They do all their bulk weighting on an [old school scale](https://static.squarespace.com/static/527802bfe4b031cf940f8c6c/54209836e4b014fffc14a073/54209837e4b014fffc14a88f/1364479867057/1000w/LJ_Peretti_Boston_HOGGERCo._WM_17.jpg) using metal weights.

Old_Deadhead: Man, that thing is awesome! I may have the opportunity to travel to Boston for business in the relatively near future. I have only a limited interest in the business aspect of the trip, but the ulterior motive is only a couple blocks from where I'd be staying! :)

--
HandsomeRalphy: Even if you end up staying further away, Boston is a pretty accesible city by walking/public transit. If you end up further away, just take the T to Park Sq, Arlington or Boylston and it would be a short walk away. The plus is you can get some great tobaccos and then walk the freedom trail after (since the start is not far from Peretti's)

====================================
PigpenMcKernan: We are everywhere.  Nice review, I will have to try this.
--
Old_Deadhead: Yes we are! 

I'm going to write a review for each of the other samples that came in their Hybrid Sampler, but this was my favorite of the four.

====================================
Bowlcake: 1.5?
--
Old_Deadhead: Sorry, I don't follow? 
--
Bowlcake: I didn’t know if the 1.5 was a mistake since you mentioned you were going to order another 8 oz of it.  
--
Old_Deadhead: It's a 4.5/5. Does it show up as something other than that? 
--
Bowlcake: For some reason I’m seeing 1.5/5.
