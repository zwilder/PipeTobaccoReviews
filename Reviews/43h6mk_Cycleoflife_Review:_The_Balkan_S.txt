Review: The Balkan Sobranie
By: Cycleoflife

Some weeks back I had posted a picture of my Buddha statue with my first bowl of the notorious BS. For the record, I was not on the hunt for it, but happened to be in the right place and the right time in cyberspace to get two tins at retail price. Why not? My tobacconist had recommended it to me months prior though he didn't have any to sell. That told me he wasn't just out to make a buck but that he honestly thought i would like it. Many people trash talk on the BS mostly due to the inflated prices out there; a consequence of its rarity. I wanted to see for myself. I promised you a full review so here goes:

**Balkan Sobranie**

**Tin note**: Hickory, pine, and oak wood smoke with hints of ketchup, chipotle and ancho peppers

**Moisture**: Very moist out of the tin. Results improved dramatically with a thorough drying

**Smoke**: Rich, full, white and voluminous

**Flavor**: Typical fired plank from the Latakia with fragrant oriental and rich Virginia dancing beneath. Hints of maple sap come and go as do notes of green chili. Properly dried, the smoke can take on a toasted pencil shaving character that some may enjoy more than others. I score this blend extremely high on balance between the components, however, they did not seem to be completely integrated. I have a second tin that I plan on aging for a year or so to see if that will come later. 

**Nicotine**: Mild

**Aftertaste**: Very pleasing and moderately persistent 

**Notes**: This blend does not disappoint. I have never had the original, so I cannot compare the two, but I am very happy with this newer incarnation. Half the tin was gone before I could even find a jar to put it in. I certainly feel that this blend is worth the retail price I paid of around $11. I do not think that it is worth paying a premium for, simply due to its rarity, as there are so many other performers that excel in this category which are all readily available. Compares with Balkan Saseini, Dunhill Standard, and the like. I give it a solid 9/10

ImherefortheH1Z1: Nice review mate, I could not agree more.  I purchased and had a tin mid 2105 that came very damp out of the tin, and I loved it.  Gave the remainder away to a BOTL in need, and a couple months back found a couple more tins online and purchased.

Opened one of the new tins and it was significantly less damp, and significantly less enjoyable, not terrible by any means but far more muted than my first go round.

Maybe the deal on this tin was bad, since I would consider the new tin ready to smoke straight from the tin, and I would NOT have said that about the previous one.

My cellared tin is making me nervous now.  It sounds like yours was more like the former.

Next time you fire up your time-machine, send me back a sports almanac and some *Christmas Cheer 2112*.
