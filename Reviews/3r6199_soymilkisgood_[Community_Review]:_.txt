Cycleoflife: I agree with your sentiments, but I gotta ask. What's up with the 5 gal buckets?

tennesseean_87: I get them free at bakeries in supermarkets. I wash them out and then use them for making beer.

Cycleoflife: Nice!

GanDuff: This is my first proper tobacco review, so be mindful of that, and take what I say from the perspective of a person who hasn't smoke all that many tobaccos.

I'm smoking this tobacco in a cob as I'm writing this.

The initial light gave off a very slight natural sweetness and tang, most definitely from the Virginias. I wouldn't normally consider this sweet or tangy for my taste, but it's because of the overall flavor that I took notice and mention it. Now, I've had a couple of VaPers (Virginia/Perique blends) before, but this one is a lot darker in taste. I would even say this is a stout blend, but don't misunderstand this as being smokey like Latakia, but a darker, woodier tobacco taste. Until now, no real peppery characteristics have come through, at least nothing out of the norm.

About a quarter of the way down the bowl I relight, and any sweetness that was there before is all but gone. This is when the flavor of this blend pushed through even more. Remember that dark tobacco taste I mentioned? Yeah, it's at the forefront and getting a little more dark and earthy now. At this point the peppery characteristics of this tobacco are a lot more present than before, but nothing too bad; a retro-hale will bring out those pepper notes more, though.

Halfway through the bowl the flavor mellows out, but the pepperiness is still there. The tobacco itself is not bad, and this is when you can taste the natural tobaccos the most. Once past the halfway mark, the pepper notes build up again.

The last third of the bowl becomes more peppery, and seems to remain that way until the final quarter of the bowl, where everything mellows out again.    
By the end of this bowl, the nicotine creeps up on me, and I can definitely feel it.    
**Edit:** Remember what I said about the nicotine? Well, my dinner seemed to be upset with me and decided it wants to come up and give me an earful...or a mouthful, I guess. Yup, it's that kind of nicotine strength.

My final thoughts:

Up until now I've described this blend as best as I could, but I haven't said whether I like it or not. Well, it's decent. As far as how it smokes, it's a cool smoke that burns well.    
While I don't hate Bayou Morning, I don't think I particularly like it all that much either. I would think that a person who likes a darker, peppery, and less sweet VaPer would enjoy this a lot more than I did.

I would rate it at a 2/4

(I'm personally tempted to rate this as a 1/4, but that's just because of the nicotine hit that I got, which I did not enjoy, not at all. However, that's not a fair assessment, especially for people who don't mind heavy nicotine blends.)

Damn you, /u/hedonaut, look at what your kindness has--*barfs*

Thanks for reading,    
Cheers

claypainter: **Blend Name:** C&D Bayou Morning  

**Description on Tin:** Bought in bulk, so I am without tin description  

**Leaf:** Ribbon cut.  According to their website contains Red and Bright VAs with 25% Perique.  Just from visual inspection it looks like it contains mostly Reds with a bit of brights and of course a blast of perique.  

**Tin Aroma:**  Smells like Virginias.  I'm not being trite; there is just nothing incredibly distinctive about the aroma.  Some earth and leather mixed in.  

**Taste:**  This is a straight-forward Virginia with a blast of perique.  The perique is present throughout the smoke and then in your face during the retrohale.  There is nothing too complex about the blend.  It is a clean honest Virginia with a hearty side of perique.  Pepper, earth, bready and toasty.  

**Smokability:**  No complaints:  It packed in the pipe well, it lit easily and it was not difficult to maintain lit.  The smoke was cool and dry.  

**Room Note:**  Not unpleasant, but nothing strikingly terrific about the aroma.  

**Thoughts:**  This was a good morning smoke.  It has been raining for days here in the Houston area.  I stood out on my wet and tree-covered driveway with my Savinelli Roma 173 and a cup of coffee.  The smoke lit well and settled into its own without much fuss at all.  The perique was bracing and the nicotine was invigorating for a morning smoke.  I didn't have to think about the smoke or what I was tasting.  It was an honest and low-key conversation between me and the pipe.  Sip the coffee, puff, puff, retrohale, BAAMMM conversation gets a bit more dynamic, then sip the coffee again.  
 If compared to other VaPers I am used to:  Bayou Morning lacks the umami savory notes that are in Escudo, and then obviously more perique than many VaPers as well (e.g., Doblone d'Oro).  
 I personally think that my palette prefers bright VAs instead of red VAs and since this seems more heavy on the reds it may be loved by others more than myself.  

**Recommend to:** VaPer lovers that are looking for a red VA based heavy VaPER.  If you are looking for that, without the salty, savory, beef-Jerky leaning Escudo, then you should try it out.  

**Summary/Rating:** I liked it.  I am glad I have the ounce I bought, and I will smoke it without hesitation, but I don't think I am going to go buy tins and tins of it.  Having said that, it was good, palettes change, and maybe one day I'll find myself pounding this stuff through my pipes.  
3 out of 4 stars.

**My Background:**  I smoke mostly Virginias, VaPers and Latakia blends, but I'm a relatively infrequent smoker and do not have pounds/kilos of tobaccos put through my pipes.

BWeice: *From an old post I wrote a few days ago:* 

I love me some Va/Per but I was not prepared for this one. No coffee needed. I didn't read the description on this blend before lighting up, all I did was remind myself on what was in it so it wasn't a total shock but my god was this jam packed with perique. I wasted no time playing around with my packing, I just dipped my cob in the bag and scooped up a decently firm pack. Lighting was a breeze and away I went. My first puff was beautiful sweet citrus with a helping of earth and oh.. what the? a whole tablespoon of pepper making my sinuses flare in anger. Wow. The retrohale wrecked my nose and it felt like my head was going to explode.. and I loved every second of it. The smoke was buttery smooth and cool. At first it was overwhelming but once I adapted to this new blend it was smooth sailing, very enjoyable. It's not too complex and didn't change all that much which was a plus for me making my morning smoke simple. This is some strong stuff in the flavor department with enough nicotine to slap you to your senses without knocking me out to the bed I slumped out of. If you're a fan of Va/Pers especially those heavy in perique definitely give this one a try I highly recommend it.

Cycleoflife: Ok, to start off I must say that this blend threw me for a loop. Much like my run in with the OJK a few months ago, I was humbled and somewhat nonplussed by this blend. I thought, great, I won't be able to write a review for this month. But seeing as there are only three submissions so far, and two of them are in alignment with my own experience, I'll give it a shot. The following review is for the pure blend I only had one bowl of. This is not usually enough to give a review for, but in this case I made an exception. 

**Tin note:** Earth, poop, and leather

**Moisture:** Pretty moist for a C&D

**Smoke:** Smokes great, no problems at all 

**Flavor:** Alternates between sweet and earthy Virginia and the extreme peppery hell fire of perique. The perique was overwhelming to me. I am fairly new to the VaPer genre and after LBF and Escudo, this was like going from Mother Goose to e. e. cummings. I was knocked off my rocker and never really recovered, though I was eventually able to finish the bowl. I remember thinking "if this is what they smoke in the morning on the Bayou, then they are even more tough than I thought!" 

**Nicotine:** Dear God I've never been so laid out from a smoke. Usually I enjoy a nice dose of the vitamin N, but I was wholly unprepared for the nausea that followed my first bowl of this. I was glad to have read on this sub about what to do in this situation and I promptly snacked on some delicious cookies. 

**Aftertaste:** I don't remember, I was too nauseous. 

**Notes:** So, having had my ass kicked, but not wanting to give up completely, I decided I would try again but with less perique. I decided Red Cake 5100 (a favorite of mine) came close to the Virginias used in Bayou Morning. I mixed the two blends 50:50 and gave that a try. It was really, really good. Having the Perique content cut in half helped a lot, but it was still strong IMO.  Nevertheless I have gone back to this BYO several times and enjoyed it every time. I think I will likely blend the rest of my Bayou Morning with Red Cake and put it in a jar to age for 6 months. I expect excellent results from this. 

**Rating:** I have to give this a 2 as the original blend is not in balance in my opinion. Others will certainly disagree. I would definitely recommend this blend to a perique fanatic, but other than that it is just too much. A solid effort from C&D with a specific audience in mind, I am just not in that audience.

antiwittgenstein: Hilarious and honest review! Keep smoking and your nicotine tolerance will follow. Thanks for padding out this meager thread.

====================================
a10killer: For me this was definitely a perique bomb There is a certain inconsistency with the Virginia and perique, some bowls seemed like I was smoking pepper, and some had the sweetness of the Virginians with a slight taste of perique. As I smoke into the bowls the peppery hell usually clears up and the proper flavor of this blend shows itself, and its simply amazing. The only drawback to this tobacco is the gauntlet of Perique in the beginning of the bowl, and the magnum dose of nicotine it delivers.

In the end this was a pleasant smoke, but not something I would keep in my weekly rotation. Due to the good smoke in the middle in end of the bowl I would like to give it a 3/4, but the beginning of the bowl is just too much of a struggle.

2/4
