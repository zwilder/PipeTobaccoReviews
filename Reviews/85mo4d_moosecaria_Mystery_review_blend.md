====================================
pacotaco90: God damn I love that coffee cub dude. 
--
moosecaria: It's one of my favorites for sure lol
--
====================================
moosecaria: Won't disclose thoughts on the blend other than I like it a lot, as we're still in contest mode. Nothing better than a cuppa tea and a pipe on a winter day.
--
adamdenton1: Liking the blend too. Just can't figure out what it is!
--
====================================
ThEricJ: How does that Bones smoke? I keep wanting to buy one but just havent pulled the trigger yet!
--
moosecaria: Like a dream, honestly. Highly recommended. I, like you, waited a while to buy one but after owning it for a couple months I'd buy another immediately (if I hadn't already spent way too much on pipes/tobacco for the year)
--
ThEricJ: Thats awesome. I just love the non finished pipes. 
--
====================================
alpinebreed: I need that mug in my life
