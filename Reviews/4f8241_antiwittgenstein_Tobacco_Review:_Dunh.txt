Tobacco Review: Dunhill Nightcap
By: antiwittgenstein

Review # 67

**Blend Name:** Dunhill Nightcap
 
**Description on Tin:** A rich flavoured smoking mixture fore the evening with its period of relaxation and leisure.

**Leaf:** Standard English – dark and light short ribbon.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Smoke. Cedar. Pine needles. Musty underneath. Smells like a great Islay Scotch.

**Taste:** Smoky and hot. Mustard. That’s a new note. Lavender, a bit soapy. Not as bad as Early Morning Pipe, but worse the 965. Oak and smoke. Charred barrel or campfire. BBQ beef. Tangy orientals pretty clear on the draw. The closest thing to smoking an Islay whisky I have had before. Really closer to Talisker. Not really sweet, but you feel the sweetness rounding on the smokiness and pepper. Hot smoky bbq with Carolina mustard sauce. Which is exactly what I am sure what the Dunhill blenders had in mind. Grows a bit plain towards the end, with just pepper and smoke and unfortunately cardboard.

**Nicotine:** 5 of course, since it is one of my benchmark tobaccos. 

1.	Hot air – 1 Q, Larry’s Blend, Prince Albert
2.	I think I feel something – Captain Black, McClelland 5100
3.	Life isn’t so bad anymore – Orlik Golden Slice, Dunhill 965
4.	Golidlocks – Court of St. James, McClleland 2015 VaPer Flake
5.	Eyelid closer – Nightcap, Erinmore
6.	Where’d my legs go – Old Joe Krantz, Big N Burley, Haunted Bookshop
7.	Coma inducing – Black Irish X, Brown Bogie

A philosophical aside:

Though it is often discounted, I feel like different alcohols give me a different and noticeable intoxication. Beer makes me sloppy. Whiskey makes me feel witty and in control. Red Wine turns the corners of my vision dark and gives me an unhealthy desire to cut people open. I am beginning to think different blends also give me distinctly different nicotine buzz. With Nightcap, true to its name, it makes me feel this pleasant drowsiness that comes with a feeling that everything is right with the world. I like this tobacco, it is tasty smoke – but I think one of the reasons I reach for it on certain days is because of the specific feeling it leaves in me. 

**Smokability:** Wet when you open the tin, but basically perfect the next day. This can overdry easily, and lose some if its flavor punch if you do so. Top notch performance.
 
**Room Note:** Smoky nutty and bready. Weird.

**Thoughts:** Another of the Standard Bearers, though no one calls this a reference tobacco, because of that addition of Perique which takes it out of the mainstream English venue. I am beginning to think I really should have had all of these classic tobaccos first thing. I adore Orlik Golden Sliced, but it was within the first 10 tobaccos I had, and my first smokable flake (Blackwoods and Irish Flake were not kind to me in my early days). I love Dunhill 965 too, as it was my first fullish English. That primacy gave me the ability to come to the experience with a less jaded view and with much less exposure to the universal praise these keystone blends hold. If you are just starting out, I would suggest you seek out the classics first, so you can avoid being underwhelmed when you have dozens of amazing tobaccos in your memory, each competing for a seat in your personal pipe tobacco Valhalla. 
 
**Similar Tobaccos:** I’ve not had one really like it, but shares some aspects of Dunhill 965, C&D Billy Budd, and GLP Haddo’s Delight
 
**Summary:** Smoky-Tangy Islay Whisky for you pipe.

**My Background:** I have been regular cigar smoker about 4 years, and entered the world of pipes about 2 year ago. My current top tobaccos are: McClellands Blackwoods (VA), C&D Haunted Bookshop (Burley), Dunhill 965 (English), and SG Firedance Flake (Aro).

**Rating:**+++

Rating system (interpreted through the world of Scotch Whisky):

(+++++) Couldn't be better (Talisker 10)

(++++) Great (The Macallan Cask Strenth)

(+++) Very good (Laphroiag 10 – Cask Strength – Quarter Cask)

(++) Good (Cragganmore 12)

(+) I think like it (Teacher’s Highland Cream)

(+/-) I both like and dislike this (Johnny Walker Black)

(-) I think I dislike this (Johnny Walker Blue)

(--)This is not for me (The Famous Grouse)

(---)I don't see how anyone could enjoy this (McClleand’s Highland)

(----)This is suffering (Johnny Walker Red)

(-----)This is an insult to my existence (Rogue Oregon Single Malt)
====================================
None: No love for laphroiag 10 regular? :( 

Great review though!

antiwittgenstein: Yes, sorry if it was confusing. I mean +++ is all 3 of the lower aged Laphroiags - 10, 10 Cask Strength, and Quarter Cask. I like them all about the same. Whats funny is I've had 18 just once - never shelled out the money for a full bottle - and I think I like it the *least* of the Laphroaig's I've have had. It is good, but the peat is so restrained compared to its younger brethren. Though I should, when my finances improve, give it another try...

And thanks!

poops_in_public: Misread roomnote as "beardy." Thanks for the very detailed review!

====================================
FullFrontalNoodly: I can definitely confirm that this is a very reasonable tobacco for newbies.  The fine ribbon, near perfect moisture from the tin, and high percentage of latakia and perique makes it very easy-burning, unlikely to burn too hot or bite, and delivers loads of flavor.  It was one I had in my very first order, was the first one I really enjoyed, and was the first tobacco I experienced an ecstatic bowl with.

However, revisiting recently after trying many other English/Balkan blends and developing my palette more thoroughly I was a bit disappointed.  I don't know if I got a batch that was not mixed thoroughly, or just happened to get a bowl (actually two now) that was not representative of the mix, but I found the perique content a bit overwhelming.  As a lover of perique that was not a problem in an of itself, but it really just took over almost completely burying the Latakia and Orientals.  It is on my to-do list to pay more attention to the contents of the next bowl I pack...

In any case, assuming the high perique content is actually a proper part of the blend, that would certainly explain why the nicotine content is so high and why it is so satisfying.  Perique, being a burley, is going to have a higher pH, which in turn is going to accelerate the rate at which nicotine is absorbed into your system.

Pipezilla: What the hell is laphroiag?

Out of the 30+ English blends I've smoked, I really love night cap.  I smoked it during my morning commute.  I need to restock.

Edit laphroiag=whiskey

====================================
KaseyKasem: I was never really big on English blends, being that I'm a codger burley smoker at heart (PA, SWR, CH, Granger, etc), but once upon a time I lit up a bowl of nightcap and it ejected my socks straight off my feet.

Ever since then, I've had a bit of a love affair with it.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Check out C&D Super Balkan.  It is very similar to Nightcap but with a significant amount of good quality burley.  Best of all, in bulk it's cheap enough to be a codger smoke!
--
====================================
LegesAequitas: Another extremely solid review. One note is that Talisker is an island malt as it's not produced on Islay. It does indeed have a similar peat flavor found in most Islays.

Edit: Please disregard my critique is you were not insinuating that Talisker is an Islay.

====================================
first-capri: Plus one just for writing, your reviews are amazing.

On your personal list of English blends, what do you enjoy more than Nightcap?

Also, where does Auchentoshan and Glenlivet (my two favorites) fall in your list of Scotch?  
--
antiwittgenstein: Ah shucks, thanks. Glenlivet 12 would be ++, the French Oak 15 and Nadurra 16 would be at least +++. I still have yet to have an Auchentoshan - can you recommend which OB to try first?

English blends I like better than Nightcap: Squadron Leader, 965, Mountain Camp (maybe my favorite English), but I like Balkans more than traditional English - Sutliff Bosphorous Cruise is probably the best I have had, but Balkan Sasieni is swank too. The Sobrani is good, but maybe not worth the artificial price increase and hassle of finding it.
--
first-capri: I have only had the American Oak variety, but I though it was really good.  Just hit the liquor store a few days ago to get some, but they were fresh out of Auchentoshan.

I also think I prefer Balkans, but I definitely need to try Squadron Leader and now this Mountain Camp.  I found 965 to be flat, ultra mellow and a nice smoke, but almost boring.
