soymilkisgood: Firedance Flake: an abbreviated review to kick things off. - **My rating: 2 - somewhat recommend**

**Blend Name:** Samuel Gawith Firedance Flake

**Tin Description:** "None but the Piper...Keeps up with the Dancer"

**Leaf:** Virginia

**Appearance:** Medium moist-ish brown flake that is uniform in color. Needs substantial drying time before smoking.

**Tin Aroma:** Very overwhelming blackberry note. It is like sticking your nose in a bottle of a slightly vinegary grape concentrate. Stinks up everything it's around with its scent.

**Taste:** Good amount of berry and light vinegary, vanilla, and some light bread notes. But mainly it's the sickeningly sweet topping that gets to me, quickly overwhelming me with that artificial lollipop/cough syrup note that I just can't take after a while.

**Strength and Nicotine:** Decent strength because Best Brown Flake is the base tobacco for this flake. So unlike aromatics in that it is satisfying to smoke in the nicotine department.

**Smokeability:** Okay if you like aromatics and/or grape kool aid. Or maybe like to smoke outside. Or have a girlfriend/wife/ladyfriend who likes this sort of scent and won't let you smoke inside otherwise.

**Room Note:** Musty grape/berry cough syrup yuck yuck yuck it stuck around in the apartment for a week afterwards I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT

**Thoughts:** A fine aromatic if you want to try something with a fruity flavor and some backbone nicotine-wise to it. But you are warned that if you don't like the tin note, you're not going to like the taste or room note. And it will stay with you for a long time afterwards, haunting your dreams.

**Recommend to:** An aromatic smoker, someone who wants to please their guests with the room note, a smoker who wants an aromatic with backbone who might not usually smoke aromatics.

**Summary:** A fine tobacco that has been ruined with the topping, which I can't stand. Be sure to store it away from your other tobaccos, and don't smoke it indoors or in a favorite pipe if you don't like the tin note. You've been warned.

**My Background:** I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes).

Cycleoflife: Well put. You summed it up perfectly.

antiwittgenstein: Review #44

**Blend Name:** Firedance Flake

**Leaf:** Standard Virgina Brown, maybe a touch darker, with a few white spots and streaks.
 
**Tin Aroma:** Raisins, blueberries, blackberry jam
 
**Taste:** Even at first light the tin aroma is present on the palate – berries, black and blue, slightly sweet, but no berry tartness, just a round fruity flavor. Muted Va Flake – citrus, black pepper, a bit of honest tobacco, nutty. It is good flake, but those flavors backup singers to the diva. Which is there, as far I have as I have noticed. Every. Single. Puff. I have never had an aromatic to be so persistent. I had a bowl of this that I smoked on for three days. When I readied to put flame to it the second day I said to myself ‘The berry will be gone, but the flake was good.’ But no, it was still there, without fading a smidge. On the third day I similarly thought ‘Surely the flavor has spent itself.’ Amazingly no. It is tenacious – and extremely consistent. What you get on first light stays on through till you hit ashville, no matter how many days you let the bowl rest.

**Nicotine:** On the mild side. I never seem to smoke at this for long, so it doesn’t build up enough to make me green.

**Smokability:** Class I asbestos. My last bowl I cubed cut, set it front of a fan, under a lamp, and then just out for over 2 full days. It was a bit easier to light, but it refused to keep lit for more than a 5-10 minutes at a time.
 
**Room Note:** Quite like the tin, blue and black berries.

**Thoughts:** This just ruined every other Aromatic that I thought was the least bit decent. The ones that I thought were tops, Molto Dolce, Barbados Plantation, Autumn Evening, Captain Black Royal, are small time compared to Firedance. They take patience and special smoking techniques to eek out the promised flavors. And the preparation. Dry for a minute too little and you are in soggy town. Dry a minute too long and the flavors evaporate before you get it in your pipe. Firedance is a bear to prepare, a beast to light, and chore to keep lit, but it is still on a completely different plane of existence compared to every other Aromatic I have tried. The crux of it is, Firedance Flake *actually tastes like the tin and room note promise.* And that is what I think all of us truly desire, above love, financial security, and a cure for the common cold.

**Similar Tobaccos:** Newminster Navy Flake? Comoy’s Navy Flake? Really nothing I have had really compares…

**Summary:** A VA flake with a pronounced, tenacious berry casing that has ruined all other aromatics for me.

Thanks to /u/pixeechick for giving me a sample in perfect time for community review!

pixeechick: I'm glad you enjoyed it. I have to agree with just about everything you have said here, especially the part about it ruining every other aromatic you come across. I think this is one that I'll keep on hand, along with Celtic Talisman, for those times when I do feel like something a little bit aromatic.

antiwittgenstein: A tin of this is absolutely going to be in my cart the next time I order. Thanks for ruining everything for me!

pixeechick: You're onto me! Mwahahahaha

Cycleoflife: **Firedance Flake Review**

Special shout out to /u/levins0 for making this possible by divying up an order. I'm extra happy not to have a whole tin of this leftover as it did not suit my fancy. So thank you. 

**Tin note**: Blackberry Jam meets fruity pebbles. This is the strongest topping I have ever smelled. While there is nothing offensive about the smell itself, it is just way way too strong and it makes me want to puke. 

**Moisture**: dripping wet, no surprise from a Gawith flake, but I feel like the topping made it even harder to dry out fully. 

**Smoke**: my first go I tried the fold and stuff after letting it sit out a few hours and it did not smoke well at all. Second try, I fully rubbed it out (RIP my manliness as I smelled like a tweeniebopper the rest of the day) and let it sit out *overnight*. I still had moisture issues with it. Also, I tried it in a different pipe for round two but found no improvement. 

**Flavor**: Meh. After the intense tin note, the last thing I wanted was more berries but that is what I got which only served to mask the nice brown flake beneath. I guess my issue is that the top dressing did not in any way seem integrated to the tobacco flavors. A good aro should blend the two seamlessly. 

**Nicotine**: My two tries at this flake were too frustrating to assess the N and I certainly was not satisfied afterward. 

**Aftertaste**: Light

**Notes**: Two tries were all I could muster, and I did it for all of you good folk out there, so I could participate in this month's review. I give it a 1/4. With all the trouble I had with it, I wouldn't even recommend it to an aro lover. But it could be the favorite of someone who just loooves berries and has ready access to a dehydrator.

SupraMario: **Firedance Flake My Thoughts**

**First**

Thanks to /u/Cycleoflife for sending this to me (I've got a plan to get you back lol), I was told I'm obligated to give a review...so first time for everything.

**Tin Note**

Umm...fruity? A lot more potent than I expected, like someone spilled some blackberry wine on the tobacco...I love Vas and Aros in general, but this stuff was even a bit strong for me...and that's coming from someone who likes Lane Limited 1Q.

**Taste**

Trying to get something out of this, was...pretty difficult, the tobacco was so damp it was like trying to keep a sponge that was just rung out, lit. Even leaving it out for a good night still caused me to have to relight it constantly. Unfortunately the minor taste of berries I did get out of this was masked with ash from my constant need to puff to keep it lit, which I still consider myself a huge novice of the pipe, so this potentially could have been my complete fault. :/ At least my wife loved the smell of it...

**Nicotine**

Honestly, after being a cigar smoker, very little bites me. This was your average amount from an Aro...not much.

**Room Note**

You know those damn candles your wife buys to make the house smell like someone just shat out a muffin bakery? Yeah...open it dust it around and put it out...quick.

**Would I recommend this**

Maybe, I know after I just got done bashing it...but this seems to be worth a damn (from all the reviews) if you can get it to smoke properly...if. I would only tell someone to try this after they had tried out other aros and were feeling the need for a dessert smoke.

**My Thoughts**

Ok, so it's tobacco? It's got that going for it...I have a feeling that they used it to soak up a few spills at the local winery...but come on...at least cut it, to tone it down a notch. I love aros, I really do, but this was a bit much, the remainder that is left, is going in a jar to age...for like 5-10...years...when I'm brave enough to open it again.

Cycleoflife: Hey, you made good! Thanks for the review!

SupraMario: Yeah, it definitely wasn't what I expected though.

====================================
AsIfThatWouldHappen: Some great reviews here, and as everything has already been said I'll keep it brief.

Tin note on this bad boy is amazing, everyone nearby me whenever I opened the tin was amazed with it. Luckily a lot of it comes over in the tastw too.

Only drawback for me was the drying time, I once sat a flake on my bench for 48hrs and it was still wet.

I found 6-8 hours on a paper towel with an extremely bright lamp aimed at it from about 3" away done the trick, and let me smoke a whole bowl folded and stuffed with about 3-4 relights.

A great tasting Aromatic with a good nic kick, a great tobacco flavor backbone, and an amazing aroma. It's only drawback is the fact it is the wettest substance known to man.

3/4

====================================
hedonaut: There's a lot already written here, so I'll break this down into a few simple sections.

**Tin Note:** Sweettarts, Kool-aid, and purple candy of some sort. This takes like purple, pure and unadulterated.

**Taste:** Oh my god sweet... You guys know well by now I tend to go in for dry, even bitter stuff. I loaded up a huge meerschaum with a flake and a half rubbed out. There's a sour note in here too, reminds me of some sort of raspberry Sourpatch Kid. Half way down the bowl and this stuff is burning like a dream. Nicotine content is a nice, even medium, and the flavor has hardly changed, for better or worse. This stuff seems uniquely incapable of biting, which is neat. I keep getting little hints of some sort of tobacco undertone to the flavor, maybe? I'm not so sure as I smoke it. I keep looking for it. Winding towards the bottom, the flavor remains constant. There's a strange herbal note that pops up once in a while, but it's steady as she goes besides. 

**Smokeability** Provided it's dried out well, this blend burns well. I took this all the way down a fairly large bowl with one relight. Nicotine is a nice, easy smoking mild-medium. There's enough there to enjoy, but it shouldn't be too much for anybody. The sour-piquant notes can wear after a while though.

**Thoughts** This is a really well done full-flavored aromatic. Most aromatics struggle to get into the medium range where this one is almost overwhelming. That, too, is this blend's greatest failing for me. Just a hint of bready, earthy Gawith Virginias and burleys would have balanced this blend out so nicely. A hint of cream and spice to bring this blend down out of the candy clouds into a rustic dessert kind of profile would have made this a go to aromatic smoke for me. It's so well put together, but just too strongly sweet and sour for me. I might have reacted better if I was expecting that, or perhaps smoking it at a different time of day. I may pick up a tin to play with occasionally or smoke out on the patio bars when I'm surrounded by non-smokers, but I doubt it. It's cloyingly sweet. 

**Summary** This will give you cavities. 3 or 4 if you like the sweet stuff, 1 if you don't. It's well put together, great quality, but not to my tastes.

====================================
Chuzordie: It was tasty,  and while the wine /  brandy flavor was there it didnt overpower imho. My first ARO Flake,  so I have nothing to compare it to.  I only had a small sample that  was shared between me and the wife,  we both enjoyed it and I find it a solid 3.6 out of 4.  I will be ordering a tin or two of this to savor some more.

====================================
Ciceronian: I know it probably isn't kosher but I'm going to chime in with a quick thought rather than a full review, since I don't have anything that reviews here haven't already captured and I don't quite fully trust my own palate to offer accurate or fair reviews quite yet.

What I will say is that while Fire Dance is overall not my thing, I'm grateful to it because I think it taught me (finally) how to handle flakes--what to look for in terms of dryness and readiness, and how to maximize the flavors and look for the best pairing with pipes. I truly think that before this blend, I was smoking flakes just about the same way I smoke ribbon cuts with the single added step of rubbing them out half-assedly.
