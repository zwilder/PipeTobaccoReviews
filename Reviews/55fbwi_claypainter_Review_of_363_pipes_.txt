Review of 363 pipes and AmericanPipeMakers

I was on the hunt for a long slender Cutty shaped pipe or a long slender Lumberman shaped pipe.  

I was delighted when Dan at [AmericanPipeMakers](http://americanpipemakers.com/) announced their rewards program and there was a beautiful Belge/Cutty (Carved by Brendon of 363 Pipes) available.  I quickly bought it.  
  
Dan shipped the pipe quickly and it arrived safely and well-packaged.  The pipe is beautiful:

Now what to smoke in it the first time... I decided on MacBaren's Navy flake. What can I say? This pipe is so precisely and well carved. The shape is delicate and commanding. The engineering is spot on.  One thing that stood out to me as I smoked it is that for my tastes, the draw hits a sweet-spot for me. I have a couple of pipes where I feel the draw is a little too tight (nothing aggravating, but not perfect in my opinion). I have a couple of handmades that I feel have a draw that is a little too open (Again - nothing aggravating, just not what my personal ideal is). Brendon seemed to hit a sweet spot on the draw. It also should be noted that Brendon provides a handsome canvas pipe bag (not just sock) with ample space to put cleaners and tobacco in.  
  
The pipe is wonderful and AmericanPipeMakers have a great range of top-notch pipes for a spectrum of price-points. There are some great businesses out there that are behemoths in size. Here is a small outfit that delivers with solid customer service.  
  
In regards to the rewards program. I got a discount to post an honest review, but the discount would take place independent on whether I gave a good or a less-than-favorable review.

boomer56: 363? Wow, that's a lot of pipes. Is the link to an archive somewhere? 

Ugh. I am a moron.

====================================
Doc_Hooligan: I have a squat tomato from 363 pipes that I'm quite happy with. It's small enough that I can sit and enjoy a bowl without committing to an extended smoking session (not that I don't enjoy those, but sometimes I just don't have the time), light enough to clench, and - much like yours - has a very nice draw that is neither too open nor too tight. Unfortunately, I didn't get a fancy pipe bag, since I didn't purchase it directly from the maker. However, I got a really good pipe and I can buy a bag for it.
