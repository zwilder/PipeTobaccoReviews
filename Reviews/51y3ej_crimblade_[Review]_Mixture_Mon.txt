[Review] Mixture Monster III
By: crimblade

**Blend Name:** Mixture Monster III

**Description on Tin(snagged from TobaccoReviews.com):** You've seen it before, you know its face But back again it comes to get its taste The same cavendish blend you love to fear. Now with four new designs to make it clear; The Curse of Mixture Monster is upon us all, Haunting the land once again this fall.

This bone-chilling blend is composed of light and dark cavendish, bewitched with a spell-binding aroma of candied apples... and evil.

**Leaf:** Cavendish, Ribbon Cut.

**Tin Aroma:** Candy Apple Carmel Corn immediately assaults you like a gift from the eldritch gods as soon as you even think about popping the tin. The smell lingers through out the dark recesses of any room it gazes upon, much to the delight, and growing horror of all around.

**Taste:** A delectable taste of long dead apples glazed in the sticky tarry melted layerings of caramel only stories can speak of. Lingering ever so menacingly in the background is the ghost of chocolate long forgotten by those that made it. Upon retrohale the spirits of those long gone caress your olfactory sense with promises of moonless nights and terrors haunting your very dreams.

**Smokability:**  Ever eager to lure you into a state of trust this blend comes perfectly suited for smoking directly from the tin. The moisture level was akin to that of an elder gods dandruff. However one finds that much like an elder gods dandruff a little extra drying can go a long ways towards enhancing the desired result.

**Room Note:** Alluring. Filled with a promise that could never be fulfilled. A haunting aura that fills your mind to disguise the lurking terror that truly awaits us all.

**Thoughts:** Truly this was a blend created by the long forgotten husks of the long forgotten eldritch deities who once ruled the long forgotten night. From the moment I delved into the terror that was Mixture Monster II I was entranced by it's dark promises of power beyond knowing. This is a blend that belongs in the cupboard of any member of the occult. A true centerpiece for any meeting of your cabal or coven. But beware, it's true terror lies in it's potential non existence in coming days due to the maleficence of far crueler forces.

**Recommend to:** Members of the Occult, Cabals, Covens, or simply a dabbler in the dark art of the aromatic.

**Summary:** This is a smoke designed to align with the dying of the world that comes every fall. It is baffling that the wizards at C&D were able to compact so much evil, so much eldritch might, so much tastiness into the blend that one suspects that at least one virgin was given up as sacrifice to powers that none can really ever comprehend. If you were to tell me that the mad god Azothoth was involved in it's creation I would not be surprised. The only real downside to this blend is that once smoked you will be forever cursed, but in the reality that is our maddening world who isn't cursed these days? This is without a doubt my favorite aromatic, though be warned that could be the curse speaking through me to lure others into it's cruel embrace.

**Drink Pairings:** The life force of Apples pressed with slabs of metal, flavored with the bark of a cinnamomum tree, and gently steeped over a hot flame.

**Final Rating:** 4/4 

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 3 years with no real experience in tobacco prior to that. My current favorites are Frog Morton's Cellar, Acadian Perique, and GLP Quiet Nights.
====================================
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: I came for the review, but stayed for the dandruff. 
--
crimblade: Hahahaha!
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Hey do you know if the monster mixture is the same from year to year and the just change the can?
--
crimblade: 2 and 3 are definitely the same, I've been told 1 was the same as well but I never got to try that one.
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Ah cool. Thanks! Great review!
--
====================================
givemeyours0ul: So, how strong is the candy corn? I like candied Apples, but dislike candy corn.
--
crimblade: Not strong, it was just the first thing in my mind to really pop up as good comparison. Most of what you get out of it is sweet candied apples with a hint of chocolate, it's that sweetness that really likens it to candy corn for me. So I doubt you'll have a problem with it due to your heretical hatred of candy corn. 

The part where I was enjoying candy corn while smoking it one evening probably helped the comparison a slight bit. 
--
chewsyourownadv: I hate candy corn too, and really enjoy MM. Get ya some.
--
givemeyours0ul: I'll have to try it. So many mentions of candy corn in the reviews I got scared.
--
====================================
landon9560: I love reading these, especially when the author goes full tilt into it (as you did, going into the dark abyss with the wording) but I hate that so many of these are for blends that either are rare as "elder god's dandruff" either because of its demand (so very little is made) or because of artificial inflation, (penzance) a one time run, a yearly thing (usually that you cannot purchase anymore, because the yearly run is over) or just plain discontinued.
--
crimblade: I'm glad you enjoyed it!

I totally get what you're saying about the blends being reviewed. I guess for me I only review blends that have thoroughly captured my interest in such a way that I think "Hey, I'll write a review!". At this point MM III is still available from SP, in fact you can still grab a tin of MM II from P&C. I'm stocking up on it only because of the FDA nonsense potentially meaning it will vanish but otherwise I'd absolutely recommend picking up a tin to enjoy. 

Sidenote: I'll try to make my next one about an affordable year round blend! But no promises. ;)

====================================
phonkubot: Do you recommend smoking this in a protective circle of rock salt?
--
crimblade: Oh without a doubt.

The problem for me is that I'm an outside smoker, salt circles are unfortunately very prone to the elements which means you could be at great risk any time you light up the dark catalyst. However I did find a solution for this that didn't require me to have all manner of armaments on hand whilst summoning ancient evil.

1) Get a cheap plastic hula hoop, preferably an extra large one.
2) Slice open the hoop and drain it of it's weighted contents.
3) Proceed to fill the entirety of the hoop with your preferred rock salt brand. I myself prefer the celtic variety as I feel it does a better job of containing this particular brand of eldritch power.
4) Seal the hoop up with some manner of tape, I recommend Lovecrafts personal brand but again I leave this to preference.

Now that you have an easily transportable warding circle all you must do is be sure to place it around whatever apparatus you will be using to summon the ancient evils and be sure to never break that barrier during the entirety of your session.

Easy as summoning a minor spirit really.
--
phonkubot: Summoning is easy, ridding yourself of them afterwards is hard.
--
crimblade: But... But... 

Why would you want to get rid of them?
--
phonkubot: Ahahaha, they smoke all my tobacco, drink all my rum.
--
phonkubot: Also, I'm loathe to waste a hula hoop
--
crimblade: Waste? 

I see no waste here.

Not when one of the potential outcomes is another eldritch lice infestation.
--
phonkubot: That's when soapstone scalp treatment is called for

====================================
pylorns: I had a sample I enjoyed and managed to snag a tin but I haven't opened it yet.
