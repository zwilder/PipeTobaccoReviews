A Long Overdue Review of U/Blindsamples' Tobacco
By: GanDuff
---
As the title says, this has been a long overdue review, one that I should have posted a very long time ago. However, it's worth noting that I actually sent in my review directly to u/blindsamples about two months ago, but I just never posted a full-length one here.

________________________________

We start off with [nice looking, long flakes. Dark and chocolate brown in color](http://imgur.com/a/c52ST). It was double bagged, and the first smell I got from the outside was a light Latakia and Virginia smell. I open both bags and smell again, and what I get is different: It smelled lovely on the inside, like warm cocoa and a dark tobacco smell; something very unique and hard to describe. "Chocolate?", I thought to myself. After admiring the flakes for a while, I rubbed all of them out to help with drying and packing.

After taking another whiff or two, the smell was more reminiscent of a tootsie roll that's been mixed in with a nice smell of Burley and Virginia; at this point, I don't smell the Latakia anymore.

On the to the taste:

It tastes like what my *realistic* expectation of Bob's Chocolate Flake, or any other chocolate flake, would be like, but not how I'd *hoped* it would be. I know how odd of a description that is, especially since I haven't even tried Bob's Chocolate Flake.

Smoking it, I can taste a touch of Latakia in there, but it's so light and minimal that it disappears in the smoke and marries with the Virginia that are the main leaf in this blend. The flavors are so well-melded together, that they create a very harmonious taste of mellow (ever so slightly sweet), dark, nutty taste, and at times, I can taste Burley from the smoke. Even though I said the tobacco smelled like it had some form of chocolate mixed in with the flakes, it could be that there's no chocolate, and that the Burley in the blend is mostly doing that (giving the nutty and cocoa-like tobacco tastes), or maybe there's a delicate topping that does that, or both!

Here are the tobaccos that I think are in this blend: extremely small amount of Latakia (definitely condimental), mostly dark and slightly sweet Virginia, and I think a little bit of Burley.

It's not a complicated blend, though. It's actually rather simple and harmonious in taste, but it's not a boring or bad tobacco either; on the contrary, it's great quality tobacco with a medium nicotine kick. I need to try and smoke it from different bowl shapes and see if I can get any other flavors from it. I tried it in a cob a few times, and in briar once.

That's it for the review portion.

Like I said at the beginning of this post, I did send in my review to u/blindsamples via PM, and this is what he said:

> Well you have definitely nailed down the components well! Of course, with that known you will probably get close to the actual blend with any guesses :)

> If you've been meaning to try Bob's Chocolate Flake, I should send you a sample of that. I keep a little around for a change from my Lakelands.

I got the components right, but as you can tell, it's *not* Bob's Chocolate Flake. Unfortunately, it seems that u/blindsamples has deleted his account, meaning we might never really know exactly what blend this is.

I hope you enjoyed reading the review,    
Cheers
====================================
carnesy: Good one Duff!! We all know you don't actually smoke! You just compulsively hoard pipes and tobacco, never smoke them.
--
GanDuff: You know, I took a survey the other the day, it was very interesting in that it shows that--NOBODY LIKE YOU! Not even Erik, and Erik likes everyone, maybe not that one guy and that other dude, but everyone else!

Ah, who am I kidding? I do just hoard pipes and tobacco......
--
carnesy: Hell man I could have told you that. I don't even like me.
--
SupraMario: Your good people...Dan Guff is the one stealing all the raffles.
--
carnesy: Nah, that's /u/Big_Black_Coffee. Screw that guy.
--
SupraMario: O yeah forgot! Lol dan is the man with the 1 Ton cellar lol
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: I was pretty upset I didn't win the KCPS raffle. What the hell? 
--
carnesy: Didn't make enough fragrant smoke offerings to the gods of wood and leaf. I mean getting 1 pipe in a raffle is one thing. Getting 7 award winning master artisan pieces requires offerings several orders of magnitude greater.
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: True. Though I would have smoked the shit out of them and burnt many great offerings of peace. 
--
carnesy: Yeah but you needed to make the offerings first as well as thanks offerings after.
--
BIG_BLACK_COFFEE: Ah. Next year I will get it straight. Thank you good priest.

====================================
Comintern: My guess would be Sam Gawith's Chocolate Flake from the Kendall Mayor's Collection. Same components but a slightly different blend.

====================================
ogsconcern: Great review!

I will miss these blind samples reviews. I wonder if the user is the same as u/publicpiper?

*twilight zone theme*
--
GanDuff: I actually know u/blindsamples' name, so it's definitely not David.
--
Ferivich: But can we be sure Duff? CAN WE?
--
====================================
Dai7: Never tried Gawith version but, do like Bob's Choc a lot.
