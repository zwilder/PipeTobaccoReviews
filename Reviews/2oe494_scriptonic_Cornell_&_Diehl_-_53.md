**Blend:** Cornell & Diehl - 530 Old College

**Blend Type:** English

**Ingredients:** Black Cavendish, Burley, Latakia, Virginia

**Description On Tin:** An outstanding blend of Latakia, black Cavendish, Virginia and Burley. A surprisingly smooth taste.

**Leaf/Looks:** Somewhat flaky Virginias, the rest is a ribbon cut. 

**Tin Aroma/Smell**:  Very light on the latakia, subtle sweetness. Not overpowering at all. Pleasant to the nose

**Taste:** Straight forward mild english blend. Very well put together. The latakia is very light after the initial light up.  Slight nutty taste on the retrohale. The Virginias are very nice and sweet.  Not a whole lot to say about this blend. It is a tasty english blend from start to finish. There is no hidden complexity, and its well blended. Nothing in there is overpowering at all.

**Smoke Ability:** Smokes great with no relights down to the bottom of the bowl 

**Drying Time:** 20 minutes tops didn't need a whole lot of time

**Rating**: 3.5 out of 5. Its pretty tasty straight forward tobacco blend for a really good price. I'll pick up a few more ounces, but this isn't something I'm going to hoard at all

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Likes like my kinda cuppa, but had never heard of it. But C&D makes so many blends it is hard to keep track of their entire stock. Thanks for the review mate.
