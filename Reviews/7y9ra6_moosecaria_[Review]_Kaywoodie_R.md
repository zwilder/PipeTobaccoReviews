Pipe: Kaywoodie Relief Grain Bent Billiard purchased from u/linearone, our sub's resident Kaywoodie dealer.

Aesthetics: The rustication is perfectly craggy while still being comfortable and interesting to the hand. There is some deeply scoured portions of parallel and wavy grain that really reminds me of the patterns found in brains. Maybe a greater metaphor for the periods of deep thought that occur while smoking. The inner bowl coating is foreign to me; I've not had a pipe with a coat like it. However, I have been assured it is some mixture of carbon and a binder, brushed on in a thin layer over the briar. I quite like the gradation from rusticated to smooth where the shank and stem meet. The stamp on the shank is crisp and well defined. Overall a very aesthetically pleasing pipe.

Drilling/Mechanics: Drilling isn't the greatest to be honest; doesn't pass a cleaner. You can see the poor alignment of the draft hole in the shank end (I am sure this is probably not standard for Kaywoodie). However, the alignment at the bottom of the bowl is spot on. The drilling of the bowl itself is slightly off center (favoring the shank end of the pipe) as can be seen in the pictures, but that is minor. Overall the drilling is sub-par, but refer to the next section as to how it affects the actual smoke. The stem is not overly tight or loose, and is removed easily. The button is well formed and comfortable.

The smoke: I was a bit wary of the draft hole being so off center in the shank; not passing a cleaner has generally been a sign of poor smoking characteristics in my experience. However, this was not the case for this pipe. I've smoked it about a dozen times since I received it, and it only gurgled once on the first bowl (which I'm attributing to impatience in drying my tobacco). And even during the one bowl it gurgled, it only did so for a few fleeting minutes. I slowed down and let the pipe oust some vapor through smoldering and it corrected itself. After that, it has been smooth sailing. No problems whatsoever; a delight to smoke each time. The bowl gets warm, but not overly so. I did not find any extant flavors or detrimental characteristics from the bowl coat either. As to whether it helps form cake, I cannot be too sure. The pipe is broken in and has a thin layer of even cake after these dozen bowls, but that is typical for a good smoking pipe in my experience.

Tobaccos smoked: Mostly Elizabethan Mixture by Dunhill (ribbon cut), but also a couple bowls of Union Square by G.L. Pease (flake cut), as well as a couple bowls of Carter Hall (ribbon cut). All smoked well.

Overall: For the price I paid (~$45 including shipping) this is an outstanding pipe. Smokes just as well as my most expensive pipes ($100+ Savinellis). I would most certainly buy another Kaywoodie, and would highly recommend buying from u/linearone. Fast shipping, well packaged, and more than reasonably priced for the quality.
