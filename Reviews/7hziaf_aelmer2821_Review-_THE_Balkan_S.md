Review- THE Balkan Sobranie
By: aelmer2821

OK so since I was asked to continue with my reviews, I decided that I would take on a classic. It's one thing to Know about the name, it's another to know about the brand, and the history therein.

My First experience with the Name was not involved with piping at all, but with Literature. I read a series of books when I was a kid about the adventures of Johnny Dixon and his friend the Professor. The Professor smoked Balkan Sobranie cigarettes, black with a gold filter. The name stuck with me into my miscreant years, and I found Cocktail Sobranie cigarettes at the loke smoke shop. I tried them, but wasn't overly impressed. Plus, at the time, smoking a pink cigarette was not something my teenage self wanted to be seen doing. 

Now, I was not able to ever try the original mixture, but it was heralded in legend: Some of the oldest advertising materials for Tobacco was for BS. This was **THE** premier English blend on the market, and anyone who was anyone Smoked it. This re-release is what I am reviewing, so if you are looking for the vintage best of, sadly you won't find it. 

Tin note is Latakia. Not latakia. Not *LATAKIA*. Just Latakia. It's pronounced, but not the burning rubber/leather of Nightcap, or SG Navy Flake. What makes this a departure for me is that it is a ribbon cut, not a Flake or RR. I tend to prefer Flakes, so this was a little outside my typical approach I suppose. But intermingled in the Latakia is Thin ribbons of Orientals which add a tangy, earthiness to the Cyprian leaf. Really overall, if English is your thing, this is the almost perfect tin note.

Ribbon cut packs easy. I am not going to explain that step. Now, I will say that this is not a damp mix. If anything, it's a bit drier than what I am used to with Flakes. It's not crunchy dry, but not moist like a flake or (shudder) dripping like a Suttcliff. Light is easy enough, Char, tamp, light, go. 

I was expecting a Lat punch right off the bat. Seems most English blends tend to mortar shell you with Latakia, leaving the remnants of your taste buds to pick up the pieces later. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Latakia. It's flavor, its room note, everything about it. BUT , in the wrong hands it's a Nuke, and you will ride it like Maj. Kong if you aren't careful. But, I was pleasantly surprised. There is a strong Latakia, but you really get a mouthful of the Oriental. It's tanginess caught me a bit off guard, and I may or may not have drooled a little. 

Most Lat blends tend to get ashy or bitter after the first half. This really doesn't. It keeps the Smokey, Spicey, Sweet and Sour tanginess throughout. Now some puffs will be tangier than others, and others will be smokier than others, depending on the balance of the mix as the coal descends. But, really the flavor is consistent. 

Now if you are looking for a nicotine powerhouse, this is not for you. This is a good, out walking the dogs, taking a relaxing stroll smoke. Not a "I had a shit day, cant get this server programmed, and i just ate and need to calm TF down" kinda smoke. Its great with Builders ( tea), or with a strong stout. 

So Good smoke, great flavor, weak nic. Is this like the original? I have no idea. Is this good enough for 007 or Prof. Childermass? I would like to think so. Thanks for reading, and 'til next time puff away!
====================================
aelmer2821: Also a note: I will try to do a different Tobacco every week or so. No promises, but Since I am well invested in this now, i figure why not.

antiwittgenstein: That is fantastic news. I did my best to do one a week for as long as I could, I think it is manageable. You have a great voice, keep it booming.

aelmer2821: Thank you!

mj2020: Good review.  I am a a english fan, and my usual is Squadron Leader.  I grab tins of BS when I see them, as I find it is a great easy smoke, doesn't hit you over the head.  I have never had the original, but have a couple old codgers I keep company from time to time with a pint and a bowl, who say this is pretty good, but not quiet the original.  (They never refuse a bowl of it!)  I enjoy big latakias but this is a perfect everyday if I could get it regularly, and a nice change of pace from my regulars, and a nice easy smoke in between more challenging tins.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Have you had other Balkans? How does it rate with the others you've tried?
--
aelmer2821: I haven't tried any other Balkans, but they are on the Xmas wishlist.

====================================
Matsutake_slayer: First rate prose. Please write more.
--
aelmer2821: Thank you! I will try.

VilaFrancaWeimar: Great review, and I am really happy that you can keep them on a weekly basis! Would you say that it is some kind of a middle of the road tobacco, when it comes to latakia and strenght? I have never tried it and would love to. I know it ain't LATAKIA, nor latakia, but is it goldylocks level?
--
aelmer2821: it's mid range. Healthy, without being WHAM!
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: Great! I hope that one day I get the chance to try it. Seems like my type of blend!
--
aelmer2821: Its a bit pricey, but worth it. Next tin I get, if you haven't gotten any, Ill send you a bit. 
--
VilaFrancaWeimar: That is really nice of you, but it might be very costly to send me some. Apreciate your gesture though, this sub is the nicest place I have ever seen online. Keep those reviews coming!
