Does anyone have a sample of jacknife plug I can buy?

I would like to sample it and write my first review.
====================================
pixeechick: I would, but quite sure I won't even be back with it before the review comes due.

levins0: I've got some ready rubbed... Does that count?

Pipezilla: It would be the same tobacco?  Just rubbed out?  Willing to sell me a bowl or two?
--
levins0: I think it's the same just pre rubbed out. No sale necessary... I'll drop a bit in the mail Monday.
