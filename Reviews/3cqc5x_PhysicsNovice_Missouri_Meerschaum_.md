Missouri Meerschaum Reverse Calabash "Cob Wasp" Pipe Review

I ordered [one of these](http://i.imgur.com/z1WyxMp.jpg) a while back from Missouri Meerschaum as an impulse buy. Im a sucker for rare and inexpensive (relatively speaking). Initially I figured I'd hold onto it in mint condition then sell it for twice its value to someone that didn't get one because an ass like me bought it to sell it to desperate enthusiasts. Then I was like, naw, I'll smoke it and lord it over those people forever. After having seen the pipe mud videos from /u/Aristocob and reading some of what /u/flatticus said on Instagram I decided to see if I should mud this pipe before I smoke it. Sure enough it has all the hallmarks of a corncob that needs to be mudded. The draw is high off the bottom and the draw hole is a thin wooden reed in the middle of the bowl that will burn very easily. The instructions that came with it just recommend not smoking down to the draw, which I feel for cob smokers is asking a lot. [So I mudded it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnIkUuYx_A). I've now let the mud set for about 2.5 days and I must say it came out really well. I like reverse calabashes for my occasional aromatic smoke. The cool dry nature seems, to me, to bring out the aromatic notes better. The pipe smoked well without a gurgle just like a normal decent reverse calabash. I even smoked it hot and fast at the end to test out the mud job (<_<). Its a good cob and a fun one for collectors. Its only my first smoke so well see what happens after I put it through its paces. I'll post the link to my YT review when its finished uploading (pretty much the same thing I wrote but with my handsome face to stare at).

tl;dr Good cob for enthusiasts and collectors. Should be [mudded](http://aristocob.com/PIPE-MUD-C350913.aspx) before smoking. Performs like a good reverse calabash. 

P.S. **IT SITS!**

====================================
DenverTele: Why did you do that to your cast iron pan?

/love me a well seasoned cast iron

PhysicsNovice: it wasn't well seasoned. It was just burned. This is to strip it down so I can be seasoned properly. Also, not my pans.

FullFrontalNoodly: If you don't happen to have a sandblaster handy you can burn off all the old seasoning by simply placing the cast iron in an electric oven during a cleaning cycle.  Just be sure you bring the cast iron up to temperature and let it cool completely in the oven so it doesn't crack from thermal shock.  (Most electric ovens have a lock to prevent you from doing this anyway.)

C-Ray6: Cast iron cookware is my favorite. Have a dutch oven that has passed three generations and still cooking.

nstano: That's a really nice cob. How often do they release interesting/collectible ones like that?
