Falcon Pipe with Meerschaum Lined Bowl Review
By: bob_12
---
Here's my first review on this sub, and its a pipe review of my falcon with a meerscahum lined bowl! I'm not the most experienced smoker but I attempted to be thorough and thoughtful when smoking to give you the best review I could. Hope you all enjoy it and if you have any more questions about the pipe, ask!

**Brand**

Falcon Pipes.

**History**

From Pipedia:
>The Falcon pipe was created in 1936 by the American engineer Kenly Bugg. However during WWII the production of the Falcon was limited. In 1949 George Hunt took over production and marketing and by 1954 6 million Falcon pipes had been sold in the U.S.A. By 1961 production started in England. In 1964 the Alco was launched. In 1967 the Brentford was launched but in 1979 it was withdrawn from the market. In 1968 production of the Falcon in Chicago, U.S.A. stopped. The Falcon International was introduced in 1977, which featured a removable mouth piece and filter.


**Shape/Shape Number**

I picked up the Standard Curved Stem from P&C with the Meerschaum Lined Istanbul Classic bowl.

**Purchase Information**

The pipe seemed reasonably priced at a combined total of around $70. Not bad for some classic engineering, but I know you can get estate ones on ebay for much less. I didn't want to deal with cleaning and sanitizing the pipe, and I was curious to see how they were new from the box.

**Materials**

The bit/mouthpiece feels like acrylic to me, and not just regular ol' plastic, but only a bit better than the kinds of bits you'd find on a MM cob. Not impressive, and they don't seem to have better stems out there. This is easily my biggest problem with the Falcon. Its unpleasant at times to clench or have your teeth rub against it. I feel like I could bite through it rather easily if startled.

The stem and "humidome" where the bowl sits is made of aluminium and gives the pipe a nice retro aesthetic. If any of you are videogamers, this pipe wouldn't look out of place being smoked by a character in one of the Fallout games, and I frickin' love that. Its solid, light and shiny all over. The bowl and stem also fit together perfectly, so no complaints there!

The bowl is briar with a meerschaum lining. I know that people talk a lot about the difference between pressed and block meerschaum, and this would most definitely be pressed.

**Finish**

Its a smooth finished bowl that isn't overly shiny, which I quite like because I find it looks a bit less tacky. Now, the grain and finish on this bowl isn't really the best, but no one will turn their nose up in disgust when they see it. Call her a 6/10 on the hotness scale. 

**Drilling/Pipe Cleaner Test**

I used both a tapered pipe cleaner and a big fluffy one and they both reached the chamber with little issue. The draw is definitely tight, and the pipe cleaner confirms that its a narrow airway. Despite it being narrow I didn't have any problems with the draw.

**Ergonomics/Weight**

The first thing I noticed about this pipe is just how damn light it is. If it weren't for the uncomfortable and cheap feeling bit you could forget that this thing was even hanging from your mouth. You won't need a steroid-enhanced jaw to keep this thing where it should be if you're doing work or moving around. I wrote for a while with it clenched and it was a dream.

How does it feel in the hand? Well, light and comfortable, but I kind of miss the solid heft of my Savinelli 320ks. Can I clench the Sav, though? No way.

**Overall**

I smoked a few bowls each of Trout Stream and Frog Morton Cellar in the Falcon, and despite being very disappointed by the Trout Stream, I found the smoking quality of the pipe fantastic. It was cool, very dry and lacked some of that ashy and bitter flavor that can come at the bottom of the bowl from wet tobacco packed down there. The FM Cellar seemed to gain a bit of definition while losing a bit of richness, and I'd attribute this to the meerschaum lining. I'm definitely going to smoke every new blend in this pipe because of the clean, cool burn it provides

Would I recommend one to all of your in /r/pipetobacco land? Yes, 100% yes. This is an experience I feel like everyone should have, and its at a price where you almost can't afford **NOT** to have one. Will everyone like these pipes? Hell no, they're definitely not the standard briar or cob experience. That's the nice thing about them though, variety is the spice of life!

Thanks for reading this crazy wall of text! Let me know how I did for my first review ever.
====================================
blenheim45: Well done!  Way to go "first timer"... of course now we will expect a regular flow of these, which will excuse your PAD.  You can't keep giving reviews without something new to review of course, I am sure SWMBO will understand. LOL
--
bob_12: Thanks! Well, I *guess* I'll shoulder that burden and keep a steady flow of pipe reviews. I'm sure the bank gives out low interest loans for PAD like they're going out of style....right?

But really, this was a fun review to write up and I'll definitely post more as I throw my money at pipes, haha.

====================================
bbartokk: Nice review. I wonder if anybody has done a side by side comparison. A briar pipe with the same tobacco in the Falcon pipe. Switch between pipes to see if there is a difference. A blind test would be even better.

I say that because to me they seem gimmicky. I mentioned the same thing with the Nording that was posted a few days ago. However, if I'm being honest with myself I am curious to see how they smoke. Just not curious enough to buy one yet.

I appreciate the review though and it does make me want to try it out.
--
bob_12: Thanks! You know, I haven't seen a review like that, but when I get a free day or two I might attempt something like that to see if I notice anything substantial. I might smoke a super wet aro just so that there's enough moisture there in the first place to notice a difference if there is a big one.

I understand that they definitely seem like a gimmick, but from my experience they seem to be a gimmick worth owning. Maybe grab an estate for a bit cheaper and that way you aren't out $70 for a new one?

====================================
crimsonrat: Really great review!. Thank you for sharing, my friend.
--
bob_12: Thanks! I'm really glad that it has been well received! Its helped give me the confidence to tackle some more reviews. Tobacco reviews are a bit more intimidating for me because I definitely lack the honed palate.
--
crimsonrat: I'm shit at describing flavors. My reviews look like: "It's good" or "It's not good".
--
bob_12: Well, I don't feel so bad now! I might add for mine: "Burned tongue" or "Tongue ok."

rwvolkl158: Nice review!  A meer-lined Falcon was one of my first pipes and still my goto sampler.  The only thing I would say is that I'm one of the rare folks that rather likes the bits on these comfort wise,  although I admit they definitely feel a bit on the weak side.

If you are interested in Falcon's history I highly recommend the book Back From the Ashes by K.A. Worth (Hunt's niece iirc).  A Kindle copy can be had for a couple bucks last I checked and despite the author's annoying tone it has a lot of good info.
--
bob_12: Thanks! I think if the bit didn't feel so cheap then I would really like it, but even with that issue I wouldn't hesitate to grab this pipe any day of the week! Do you have a straight or bent stem?

I'm a huge history nerd so I will definitely be picking up the kindle version of that book! Pipe smoking and history seem intertwined so much, I just wish there were more books on how they go together.

4noggins: Falcon Pipes are my go to pipe. I three stems and dozens of bowls. Can't beat them for the money and being a clencher, they just sit right in my mouth. Lightweight and funky. I recently got a few block meerschaum bowls made for Falcons and, Wow, what a smoke. I highly recommend these pipes.

bob_12: Oh wow, block meerschaum bowls? Where'd you get those? I'd definitely be interested in picking up a few of those! I can only imagine how much better of a smoke that would be with the whole Falcon system.

I haven't tried the briar bowls yet, what do you think of them?
--
4noggins: I sell them. They are out of stock right now. I have more coming and hope to have them on my website in the next few weeks.

itoddicus: Thanks for the review, I was pondering picking one up.
--
bob_12: No problem! Hope it helped.

Darwin7848: A 9mm 
Softy is an excellent fix for that hard Falcon bit.
--
bob_12: Good idea! The softy bits are pretty hit and miss for me, but this pipe definitely could use one.
