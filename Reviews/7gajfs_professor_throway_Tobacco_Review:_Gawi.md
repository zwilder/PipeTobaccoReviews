Tobacco Review: Gawith and Hoggarth Dark Flake Liquorice

Ok I am behind on the Simple, Strong, and Shaggy review series. I promise to finish that off, but this one sort of got done first. 
As part of /u/antiwittgenstein ‘s review contest, this should be review #5. Likely the last one to get done before the deadline.

**Gawith and Hoggarth Dark Flake Liquorice**

* Description on Tin: None bulk only

* Description on tobaccoreviews.com: Gawith Hoggarths Dark Flake is a popular tobacco among those who want a full smoking experience, in both body and flavour. Comprised of fired and dark air cured Virginia's before being hot pressed into cakes. The classic dark plug is topped with natural Liquorice extract for a little extra flavour to this powerful flake.
	
* Component Tobaccos: Virginia and Burley. G&H states "Made from equal part of Malawi Dark Fired and Indian Dark Air Cured" but I don’t understand what that means
	
* Cut: Thick meaty flakes. Looks like beef jerkey (doesn’t taste like it though)

* Jar Aroma: Surprisingly not at all like licorice. Pungent and smokey. Side by side I can’t tell the difference in aroma between this and Dark Flake Unscented.

* Taste: Very confusing at first. Taste likes Dark Flake Unscented with a little extra sweetness. For those who haven’t had G&H Dark Flake Unscented before it is earthy. Like peat moss and compost earthy. Metallic tasting, like country well water not like chewing on foil. A bit spicy and peppery. When I first smoked this, it took me a while to taste the liquorice. For almost all the first bowl I swore P&C sent me the wrong tobacco. Then it hit me, the roughness of Dark Flake Unscented was smoothed away. There was no harshness or brashness. Instead a light sweetness permeated through the smoke. The liquorice flavor is there but it is like chewing on liquorice root rather than eating licorice candy. It is more like eating a piece of anise or fennel than taking a shot of Sambuca. If you know the flavor of Sen Sen, that is what you get. It compliments the flavor of the flake very well. It does its job without being obtrusive. It adds sweetness without being sweet. Liquorice flavor is very noticeable in the long lived aftertaste. I also pick up the same hint o’ the Lakeland Sauce that is present in Dark Flake Unscented and a lot of other G&H blends. If you are sensitive to the soapiness you might want to stay away. 

* Strength: Strong. Strong. Strong. Strong. Mule kick to the head strong. Niccups a plenty the first time I had a G&H Dark Flake. Stronger the 1792. Stronger than Irish Flake. Stronger than G&H ropes. Full stomach, sweet drink or small bowls recommended. 

* Smokability: For as thick as this flake is it rubs out really well. I like to give it a coarse cube cut then rub it out a bit more. I have also just rubbed out the flake directly with good success. Smokes cool, no way though could bite even if you freight train’d it. 

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. It seems pretty potent. I don’t think you will win any popularity contest. Wife hates the beard note.

* Thoughts: A new favorite. By new, I mean I just finished 2oz over the last few weeks and now I want to order a lot more. If you want a licorice aromatic this isn’t it. Try Esoterica Ramsgate. This is liquorice not licorice. It is herbal and medicinal not candy sweet. The interesting this is that smoking this tobacco helped me understand the flavor of the G&H scented flakes. They are topped with tonquin, liquorice, and maple. I could never separate out the individual top note flavors before, they all just sort of blended into one taste. Now that I understand the liquorice flavor, I can pick apart the flavor profile of the scented flakes much better. In terms of G&H offerings, I think this has replaced Dark Flake Scented for me. Unscented was a little too rough, the liquorice topping smooth things out but still lets me taste the component tobacco without drowning them out (like with Dark Flake Scented). Brown flake Scented is still my favorite G&H tobacco followed closely by Ennerdale. I think the lighter flavor of the brown flakes works better with the heavier Lakeland flavors.
 

TL/DR Strong earthy flavors. Liquorice is very mild but is highly complementary to the tobacco. Give to a newbie and watch ‘em turn green.

Not just a newbie. I got blindsided by this back in the summer. Hoooo boy, 1st blend to make me nauseous enough to dry heave in quite sometime. Smoke after a FULL meal, with a sugary drink on hand, only.

professor_throway: u/crimblade had the review of Dark Plug a month os so back and commented that the N level is even higher in the plug than in the flakes. I can only imagine what the neighbors would think of me puking off the side of my deck at 11pm at night.

crimblade: Nothing wrong with sending newbies off to the halls of Valhalla!

At least that's where Dark Plug sends me sometimes...

====================================
antiwittgenstein: An intriguing blend that I am never gonna smoke - not being an anise fan, being a nicotine wuss, and generally boycotting G&H. Have you had H&H Burley Kake? It has this slight anise flavor that isn't too bad. But it won't make you puke, so maybe not to your liking...
--
professor_throway: As much as I like this it is obnoxiously strong. Sometimes I would like to have a bowl on the afternoon and not have it kill me. 

I haven't tried Burley Kake yet. It is on my ever lengthening list of tobacco to try. I must admit I like the old fashioned anise and burly combination. Velvet was am immediate Bell ringer for me for just that reason.
