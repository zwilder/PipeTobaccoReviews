====================================
lightningserpent: I got my tins today as well. I don't have it in me to try it tonight, but I wouldn't mind living vicariously.

====================================
mile_high_me: I know you said review is coming later but let me ask you this, Should I open mine tonight?????

jackstiofain: Well,  I got two. Gonna open the other in 8 to 12 months. I'd say open it! The smell is great. Some say they smell that Lakeland soapiness with SL (which I never had). Some also say SL is "too mellow"  for them. But to me I can really smell the Turkish and some soft sweet aromas of the Virginias. It could be that the Perique is bring out more of the qualities of the Turkish tobacco. There is also a slight BBQ hint wafting in the background. As for the taste, so far on my first eighth, it's great, smooth, got this great tangy spice of the Turkish leaf with a slight must of the Perique, so far.

AsIfThatWouldHappen: Try Skiff mixture too, it's a very rich and oriental blend.
--
mile_high_me: I got two also but I'll definitely be opening one tonight now. Thanks for the mini review!

DenverTele: Man I hope my 2 tins aren't lost in shipment.
--
mile_high_me: they were rerouted to a place south of you. Sorry about your mailbox but there was a bee. Yeah thats it a bee.

DenverTele: Whoo hoo!  Tracking showed up again.  Looks like I'll get it today.

====================================
thesillyoldbear: YAY!!!

====================================
pwny_: I'm confused as to why it's a "special edition." Why not make all Squadron Leader that way, as that's how it used to be, or roll the formula into a newly-branded regular blend? The "get it now before it's gone!" crap is lost on me when it seems like an uncredible threat.
