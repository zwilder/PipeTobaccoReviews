Review: Spectre Pipe Tobacco

At the request of /u/BriarBoy in regards to this weeks P&C.com sale* I present my review of:

Blend Name: Spectre Pipe Tobacco

Description on Tin: Spectre is a pipe-tobacco adaptation of the successful Spectre cigars, which were the first widely-available cigars containing Latakia. It's a rich blend of Virginias, Orientals and Latakia spiced with a mixture of cigar leaf from around the world. 

Leaf: Ultra fine cut shag ribbon. Colors range from tan to brown to black. Very dry right from the tin, almost prairie brush dry.

Tin Aroma: Heavy scent of Latakia backed by the mustiness of a cigar

Taste: Depends on how you smoke it. If you smoke it even remotely fast it will turn harsh and be unsmokeable, if you smoke it slow the cigar leaf dominates and you get a slight shadow of latakia after you blow the smoke out of your mouth. If you smoke it still slower the cigar behaves and at least tries to play nice with the other leaves but quickly grows bored and wanders off to do it's own thing while still technically being present. That leaves the Lat and Va to pick up the slack. Sadly despite being very strong in the tin aroma and making up a minority but still considerable bit of the composition the lat just isn't strong enough to carry the the bowl on it's own, especially since the Va is hardly noticeable.

Smokability: It likes the flame and burns easy, but if you don't appease it by smoking it just right it will turn into a full on nightmare. Like the spiritual entity it's named after you have to balance the ember to be neither burning nor extinguished but stuck perpetually somewhere in between.

Room Note: For something that contains as much (poor quality) cigar leaf (in my opinion) as this does and with the lat to boot it's actually quite pleasant. 

Thoughts: Russ dropped the ball on this one. I've heard that the proper way to smoke Va's for their fullest flavor is to keep the ember just on the verge of dying and it would seem to hold true for this blend as well, though in my opinion there isn't enough here to justify the effort and worry in performing such a balancing act.

Recommend to: No one

Summary: Skip it. If you want something with cigar leaf there are plenty of other blends out there that are far better. If you want tinned tobaccos there's Key Largo by G.L. Pease and [McClelland's Dominican Glory Maduro](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/2x65z8/review_mcclellands_dominican_glory_maduro/) for roughly the same price as this blend (at MSRP) or if you buy bulk you can get 4 ounce of C&D's Billy Bud for roughly the cost of a tin of Spectre.

My Background: I've been piping seriously for about 2 years (messed about with it prior but was so infrequent in smoking and halfhearted about it I can't really count that time period). I smoke only once or twice a week due to my living arrangements and other demands on my time that preclude me from sitting and truly enjoying my pipes but for all that I do truly consider myself a full on pipe smoker now. Also I have started to dabble in cigars and while I'm by no stretch an expert on them I can tell good leaf from bad when I taste it. 

*I don't know how much of a sale this really is because less than a month ago I bought this tin at the same $6.99 price they are selling it for in this weeks "deal". Another instance of them marking up so they can mark it down to try and move a few units.

EDIT: Cleared up some spelling errors and simplified some wording.

paok1234: Nice review. Thank you. I like the cigar so, when P&C ran the special with a free tin I picked a couple. I have them sitting in my cellar. Hopefully some age will mellow it out a bit. Although, a poor quality cigar leaf will still be of poor quality, only older. Lol

carnesy: I have a 5 pack of the cigars I'm waiting to smoke. On the pipe tobacco side of things for being billed as a Lat cigar combo blend they went really really light on the Latakia.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Nicely done. Very clear and honest.

SmokinLogan: Thanks for the review. I was actually looking at buying a tin, but not now.

Pipezilla: Nice review.
I'm intrigued by the idea of cigar leaf in tobacco but more intrigued by the idea of latakia in a cigar. I will skip the tin and get ahold of a Spectre cigar and purchase one of the other cigar blends mentiond.
--
carnesy: The cigars are actually very, very good. You won't be disappointed.
--
Pipezilla: Now I will have to stop by and get one or a pack...

Latakia in a cigar. That got me intrigued when I first heard of them.
--
carnesy: It's not something I'd smoke on the regular enough to buy a box of, but I can see keeping a fiver of them on hand for when you want one.
--
Pipezilla: A fiver is what I meant. I only smoke cigars maybe once a month.

What is the latakia profile in the cigar? Is it strong? barley there? Middle of the road? 
--
carnesy: It's kind not super noticeable on the draw, you get a hint that there's something else there, almost foreboding sense that something isn't "normal" but you can't put your finger on it, followed by the verification that the cigar leaf isn't the only leaf smoke dancing on your tongue, and the Dark Lady is finally fully revealed lingering in the aftertaste post exhale after the body of the smoke is gone.

In less spooky, ghostly terms: it's there, you can tell it's there but it plays well with the other leaf, dancing to the font and back of the profile depending on which part of the smoke cycle you're on.
