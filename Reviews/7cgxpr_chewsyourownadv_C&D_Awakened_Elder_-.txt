C&D Awakened Elder - A Review

**Special notes:** The stars have long taught me to watch for auspicious timings, and that of /u/antiwittgenstein's review contest is no exception. I step into his contest, not as adversary, for he is no villain to the learned, but as accomplice. Should my review be judged worthy of his prize, I shall choose from one among you to be the recipient in my stead. Let the worthy prove themselves with the most Lovecraftian reply to this post, to be determined purely by myself. Per /u/antiwittgenstein's rules, recipients should be those who have not had Stonehaven before.

It is with grave reticence that this warning comes to you. It is a mere month since Laudisi let slip words of their "new" tobaccos, *The Old Ones*, and only days since my withering fingers first grasped those loathsome tins, but time, it has become twisted, the days unfamiliar and muddled. The secrets of *The Old Ones* were, until this time last month, familiar to only a few of this world, and fewer of others. Those of us cursed with this forlorn knowledge are watched. What event would befall a man, to cause him to forsake his unholy vows, to have him loose this danger upon the slumbering earth? What madness struck the pitiable minds of that venerable house, Cornell and Diehl, that would have them risk drawing the gaze of the Elders from across the abyss of space and time?

As my pipe fizzles with the last pinch of that terrible and beautiful, and I find yet more crumbling delicately across my fingers with no memory of having reached for more, I myself now risk invoking that unknowable wrath. It is not for madness, nor for spite of my  masters, that I now share this knowledge. No, it is for warning's sake, for the contemptible and pitiable masses who slumber ever in their ignorance, as House Cornell and Diehl itself has already loosed the shoggoth from the sea, as it were. I write to warn you that the Elder himself has been Awakened, and I suspect many of us will succumb to his will.

**Blasphemous Name**: C&D Awakened Elder

**Description on ~~Tin~~ Dimensional Pocket**: After centuries of undisturbed slumber, something has awakened them. In their return, a great plume of exotic smoke rises from the Deep, redolent with notes of Latakia, Katsuri, Virginias, Burley, Perique, and black Cavendish.  

**~~Leaf~~ Physical Manifestation**: Ribbon cut, suspiciously normal. A bit dry from the tin, as should be expected from leaf gathered from the rocky and blasted arid regions of the plateau of Leng. A little clumpy in places, but it crumbles easily, like the facade of sanity society has convinced itself it is wearing.

**~~Tin~~ Dimensional Pocket Note**: Latakia, up front. I won't hazard a guess at ratio; it's the little pieces of obscene knowledge that truly erode at one's mental faculties. There's the usual C&D burley+perique stewed fruit scents dancing around in the background, and something I do not recognize. It's that something that first piqued my interest in this forbidden blend, floral perhaps without being sweet, like the bitter scent of hops. Yes, this is the terrible secret that likely drove House C&D mad. Kasturi leaf, I'd wager, rumored to be one of the earthly aspects of that old creature who I shall not name here.

**Taste**: The first blast of the charring light is unmistakable, and old and unruly friend, the loud and obnoxious sort that you can always depend on to tell you truths in blatant fashion that you have perhaps yourself ignored. It is bold and careless, but you move past his rough edges and settle into conversation. Latakia, Virginia, Perique, Cavendish, and... something else. I know this creature. We've spoken into the late and dark hours time and again. It's heavy, bready, smokey, a little fruit and spice, easy going after the first light. It's my friend, Plum Pudding, no doubt, but he visits on the new moon under auspicious stars, and I see him changed. It's that subtle floral note, a tendril of corruption winding through the fabric of a blend I know. It reminds me vaguely of cigar without the pretense of being a "cigar leaf blend." My old friend is something subtly new, speaking of different truths, deeper, his words more intoxicating than ever. The floral note lingers throughout, more pronounced that what I might find in Semois, without the jagged, rustic edges. The Orientals of Plum Pudding, Izmir I suspect, have been carved out of his soul and replaced with this intoxicating, somehow subtle yet bold, insidious lead. This is my friend, Plum Pudding, but somehow awakened with Kasturi.

**Smokability**: Moisture levels make it smokeable straight from the tin, although a few minutes of drying will see to fewer relights at the end of the bowl. Like any suitably rich tobacco, care must be taken not to incur its wrath. Smoke slowly and listen quietly to the gentle yet unspeakable truths that emanate from depths of your pipe, and then shall it burn steadily to the bottom, even as does your spirit, and it is when you are cleansed that your fingers will find a pinch ready to dribble into your pipe for another go, without so much as a will or intent to drive them.

**Room note**: Tentacles. This blend is not to be smoked amongst the uninitiated. 

**Nicotine**: Not bad, but I've got the metabolism of a Dark Young and am thus a poor judge of such things.

**Thoughts**: I must admit, my own past with such topics being interrelated and sordid, the idea of *The Old Ones* intrigued me even as my tortured soul cried at the prospect of another such themed product. I bought the entire collection, knowing the terrible truth that so often the product is a soulless capitalization and reduction of the dread secrets of the cosmos. A part of me hoped this would be the case; while we who are watched long to be free of the shackles of forbidden knowledge, we know what shall befall us should we break our unholy oaths and our longings become contempt for those who would not pierce the silence even as we revile our own cowardice. 

House Cornell and Diehl, for reasons unfathomable, has taken this step, and faced with a choice to continue slinking in the shadows of my own fear, or to give mankind my sincerest warnings now the cosmic secrets are sold for $9.78 + S&H, I choose to step forward with that ancient House and endure the wrath of the watchers, even as I embrace my own destruction. Ia, Ia Dagon. Ia, Ia Shub-Niggurath. Ia Joseph Lankford. May my sins be judged worthy of your countenance as I face the annihilation of the Awakened Elder.

**Rating**: 4.5/5 
====================================
SmokeOnTheWater17: Catsuri are the leaves of beauty, invincibility, wonder, pride, freedom, coldness, self-sufficiency, and roguish individuality - the qualities of enlightened, mentally developed, pagan, cynical, poetic, philosophic, dispassionate, reserved, independent, Nietzschean, unbroken, civilised, master-class level tobacco. But they must burn lightly and the Elders may or may not approve.  But burn they must, at the risk of wrath, because more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lure of Catsuri, and it demands a fellowship worthy of flame. Latakia masks Catsuri's entrance, Perique paves a clean, peppery trail, Burley pushes aside the bittersweet carpet Virginia leaves behind and the entrance cleared, Catsuri wafts gently across the landscape to bring all of the gang to a climax worthy of Elder appreciation.  

- with apologies to Lovecraft for butchering his quotes to hell and back.

====================================
sonofwang: So you liked it?
--
chewsyourownadv: Yes, very much. I actually might start looking to this stuff when I'm in the mood for Plum Pudding. I'm really digging the Kasturi leaf and wondering if others will think of it as comparable.
--
sonofwang: I was just kidding with my question. Great read! Lots of high quality and entertaining reviews coming out of the contest! I haven’t tried any of this series, but the Mad Fiddler’s been calling my name.
--
chewsyourownadv: I've had one bowl of Mad Fiddler and thought it was really good. It brings the Kasturi leaf to the front. It's very prominent and may come off as a little gimmicky, but it smells and tastes really neat. I told someone else that it reminded me of having a Lakeland, or deertongue, or the like for the first time. The leaf is very different from other components. It blends well in Awakened Elder, but is obvious in Mad Fiddler. 
--
sonofwang: Cool, thanks for the info! Sounds like a good first choice to see what the Katsuri is all about.
--
====================================
antiwittgenstein: This is one of the most densely themed, silliest, and somehow insightful reviews ever posted on this sub. I wish I had written it.
--
chewsyourownadv: Ia, /u/antiwittgenstein, Ia.

====================================
phonkubot: A review of Eldrich fantasies! Amazing review, jolly good show!
--
====================================
Old_Deadhead: I find your description has released something deep within me. A feeling, a compulsion...something darker, perhaps. I, too, have shared the companionship of the smoke to which you allude, and I find myself laying awake at night as the desire comes upon me unbidden to taste it again but, perhaps, with something a bit more, sinister. 

Based upon the foul depths of your review, I feel the insatiable desire to tarnish my very soul with this evil blend. I offer both my thanks to you for having given me knowledge of its existence, and curse your very being for enticing me with yet another tobacco, dark and foul, that I will be compelled to purchase. 
--
chewsyourownadv: Welcome, brother, to the depths.
--
====================================
RegicideBrown: Bravo. Holds to the theme without being excessive or obviously gimmicky, still communicates everything I wanted to know.

Well done. I'm looking forward to my own tin of Awakened Elder even more now.

Have you tried Innsmouth? That's the other one I ordered.
--
Crow_The_Robot: >	Innsmouth

Does is have strong notes of fish?

I had no idea there was Lovecraft themed tobacco...uh oh. 
--
chewsyourownadv: I've had a couple of bowls of Innsmouth, and think it's pretty good, although it doesn't really stand out from other blends I've had along the same lines. The Katerini is somehow similar to Izmir-forward blends I've had. Not bad, not great. I like it, but probably won't be buying more.

Miskatonic Mixture, on the other hand, is much more in line with what I was looking for. Same ingredients, I think, but a bit more forward in Katerini. It's a variety of Oriental I enjoy a lot, so I'm happy to see a blend like this really run with it while being a bit deeper and more complex than McClelland's Katerini Classic. I do enjoy that one a lot, but it is really meant to showcase that specific leaf and not much else.
--
====================================
crimblade: Ugh, I really wanted these to be ok tobaccos with gimmicky names, now I'm going to have to get a tin of each when I can justify budgeting it. 

Thanks for the review, really well written!
--
chewsyourownadv: So far I've tried Awakened Elder, Innsmouth, Mad Fiddler Flake, and Miskatonic. For a good smoke that uses a leaf (Kasturi) you likely won't see elsewhere, Awakened Elder of course is good, but Mad Fiddler really brings it out to the front. For the other blends, including Dreams of Kadath, I was personally looking forward to seeing how they use Katerini. Innsmouth isn't bad, but a little disappointing on that front, while Miskatonic seems more what I was looking for. I haven't tried Kadath yet, but the smell of Kentucky and Katerini together is very weirdly pleasant, and I'm looking forward to carving chunk off of the plug soon.

DaveAzoicer: Well damn, now I got to get my hands on those tins lol
