**Blend Name:** Jack Knife Plug

**Description on Tin:** dark-fired Kentucky leaf and ripe red Virginia tobaccos, with their deep earthy flavors, are layered on a central core of golden flue-cured for a hint of bright sweetness, then pressed and matured in cakes, and finally cut into 2oz blocks. Slice it thick and rub it out for ribbon cut, thins for a shag, or chop it into cubes. The choice is yours!

**Leaf:** Kentucky, Virginia

**Tin Aroma:** Nothing. All I could smell was the paper it came wrapped in.

**Taste:** Once I finally got this to work (see more on these mis-adventures below) it turns out to be a very consistent mix of strong flavors that seem to rotate through the lead. Sour cherries become rhubarb, but are then pushed aside by vanilla and caramelized sugar. Did I mention these were strong flavors? 


**Smokability:** Breaking out my actual grandfather's actual jack knife for extra flavorstalgia, I was instantly reminded how difficult it can be to slice tobacco. The original plan to cut this more or less as I smoked it did not long survive this moment, and the rest of the block got sliced up with a chef's knife into cubes. I took a solid 4 hours to dry out even here with midwestern winter levels of humidity, but once those hurdles were overcome it proved surprisingly smooth with a hefty amount of N. 

**Room Note:** A passerby asked if I, "had a saddle in there?" 

**Thoughts:** It took a couple of bowls before I got the moisture figured out, and even then it seemed like the rubbed out tobacco needed some time in the jar to achieve its full potential. Not something I would want to try all day, but would be very nice in the early autumn. 

**Recommend to:** Someone who likes a strong Nicaraguan cigar, only more so. And who has better knife sharpening skills than I do. 

**Summary:** Prep issues aside, this was a really good tobacco. Initial worries about strength proved unfounded, and it is way too easy to get lost in the interplay of flavors. I can no longer take this in the car, as I keep missing when the lights change. This tin was exactly a month old when I opened it, and it would be interesting to try this with some age.

Terence_McKenna: Great review... my only suggestion is that you try using a sharp cleaver (pressing straight down) to cut your plug.
--
boomer56: Hmm. That is a good idea. Better than the band saw I was not at all contemplating. Thanks!
--
None: You lose too much tobacco on the kerf with a bandsaw.
--
antiwittgenstein: Really great, funny review.
--
boomer56: Thank you! 

I've been making a point of looking out for your reviews for a while now, so I count this as high praise.

tribial: the "had a saddle in there" comment had me rolling.

simplechef: **Blend Name:** Jack Knife Plug (Ready rub)

**Description on Tin:** dark-fired Kentucky leaf and red Virginia tobaccos, with their deep, earthy flavors, are layered on a central core of golden flue-cured for a hint of bright sweetness, then pressed and matured in cakes before being sliced and tumbled to a ribbon form, ready for your smoking enjoyment.

**Leaf:** Dark fired Kentucky, Virginia

**Tin Aroma:** When opened I got a strong bacon smell, now that air has gotten to it, it reminds me of that shredded beef jerky I got in a plastic cylinder almost like chewing tobacco. 
 
**Taste:** Very strong on the smokey flavor. Honestly, it was like smoking a very good home made beef jerky/bacon.

**Smokability:** Since I got the ready rubbed, I didn't have the difficulty others may have had. It smoked just fine like any tobacco that one would get. It burned smooth and rich. The smoke was nice and thick.

**Room Note:** Well I mainly smoked it in a cigar lounge so the room note was kind of masked, or it blended in well with the cigar smoke no one noticed it.

**Thoughts:** Good tobacco, I liked the meatiness of the flavor. Will smoke again 3/4

**Recommend to:** Anyone who wants to smoke a tobacco with a lot of flavour but not the sweetness of an Aro.

**Summary:** Like I said good tobacco, will smoke again and recommend to my cigar smokers who are interested in getting into pipes.

antiwittgenstein: I like your overly specific metaphors for tastes and smells.

mk_bway: [Review #1: JackKnife Plug](http://i.imgur.com/wLTb4xG.jpg)

This is my first tobacco review. I don't have a lot of experience with non-aro's. Since getting back into pipe smoking in December, I've found myself gravitating more towards English blends. The limited experience I do have with them has been kind of hit or miss. So I was actually pretty eager to give this one a shot. We'll skip the tin description and blender info and get right to the meat of the review.

* **Tin Aroma:** Wow! My first thought was that it was actually beef jerky labeled as pipe tobacco. A little more nosing brought on some hickory smoke barbecue scent. It is a very meaty aroma. After slicing it and rubbing it to a nice shag the aroma was more of a classic tobacco scent, a bit of an earthy sweetness. I could smell a tin of this for days, it smells glorious!

* **Leaf:** This comes in a plug and looks like a brownie with a thin layer of peanut butter in the middle. The leaf is mostly dark with a couple of lighter bits sprinkled in.

* **Taste:** I got a lot of tangy spice while smoking this, but I also picked up a few other flavors. Most notably would be a sort of dry barbecue rub flavor with hints of salt and lime. It's a pretty strong flavor and quite savory. I didn't think it was all that complex, but it held my interest throughout each bowl I smoked.

* **Room Note:** Generally my wife thinks all of the tobacco I smoke smells awful. She actually said this didn't smell too bad. Personally, I don't think that I can judge room note very well as the active smoker, but this had a really nice, sweet tobacco aroma that I got hints of every now and then. It smelled exactly how pipe tobacco should smell.

* **Strength:** As most reviews of this indicate, JKP packs a pretty potent nicotine punch.

* **Overall:** I've really enjoyed the four or five bowls I've had of JKP. It seems to work better in my MM Country Gentleman that my Stanwell 118, but I may just need to pack it a little different in the Stanwell (I'm still honing my technique). I definitely plan to keep some of this around. It's a really good evening smoke to me. The full flavor and potent nicotine level make this a very nice tobacco for an after dinner smoke while the sun is going down. Preparation can be a little tedious, but the smoke is more than rewarding.

* **Rating: 4/4 Highly Recommended**

edit: minor typo.

antiwittgenstein: Nice write up, keep em coming. Nothing develops a palate like being forced to concentrate on it for reviews. You made me really want to try this stuff.

**Description on Tin:** dark-fired Kentucky leaf and red Virginia tobaccos, with their deep, earthy flavors, are layered on a central core of golden flue-cured for a hint of bright sweetness, then pressed and matured in cakes before being sliced and tumbled to a ribbon form, ready for your smoking enjoyment.
Leaf: Dark fired Kentucky, Virginia

**Tin Aroma:** I bought a tin of this a few months ago, smoked it a bit, then stuck it in a mason jar. Cracking the mason jar, I was greeted with a smokey aroma, a bit of a cross between leather and good barbecue sauce. Tangy, woodsy, just a little peppery and sweet.

**Taste:** When I first tried JKP, I didn't care for it all. I thought it was harsh, flat and bitter, and the closest thing I could think of was smoking American Spirit cigarettes. Just tobacco, nothing else. After a few months of aging, however, I tried it again. This time I found I liked it quite a bit! Sipped it slowly, making sure to notice the retrohale. Dark, dense, flavorful. More like a cigar than most pipe tobaccos I've tried, but had a great chewable mouthfeel, with savory almost meaty body. Just a bit of the tang I detected in the tin note, a little brown sugar/molasses sweetness (just a touch), and a big wallop of leathery, almost hickory smoke. Quite a bit of spice to the retrohale, reminds me of black peppery beef jerky.

**Smokability:** Followed Pease's instructions, sliced a couple 1/8" ribbons off, and rubbed them out. Let them dry for about 20 minutes. Packed fairly loose, just a little tamp after the charring light. Smoked decently, I had a couple of relights during my smoke, which is common when I take a pipe for a walk. Burned nice and even, left a bit of ash and black dottle at the bottom of the bowl.

**Room Note:** Smoked while I was walking, so I didn't get a huge amount of room note going, but what I did smell was quite pleasant. Very old time pipe smell, nowhere as offensive as a pipe or cigarette. Not necessarily going to bring the crowds running to tell you how good you smell and how it makes them miss their grandpa, but not too far off of a nice hardwood BBQ.

**Thoughts:** Quite enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the rest of this plug. I like the ritual required in slicing, rubbing and drying. **WARNING:** The nicotine hit on this bad boy about knocked me on my ass. I don't think I'm a huge lightweight, but it seemed to be even more nic heavy than my personal previous beltholder, Peterson Irish Flake. This might supplant that one in my rotation, as the taste of JKP is not dis-similar, but quite a bit better tasting. Just have to make sure I can sit down somewhere and let the spins go away.

**Recommend to:** Fans of dark, rich, pure tasting tobacco. Not a lot of sweetness or mystery to this one that I could tell, just bold, high quality tobacco. Also recommended for those who like a bunch of nicotine.

**Summary:** Dark, bold and rich with a big ol' nic hit. Smokey, leathery, tangy and a little touch o' sweetness. 3/4
--
antiwittgenstein: Nicely done. Heavier than Irish Flake sounds scary. Of course I haven't tried the stuff since I put my big boy pants on.
--
mtn_mojo: This stuff was so heavy that by the end of the bowl, I took my big boy pants right back off and lay down on the couch.

tribial: I got my tin today (was hoping it would get here Friday). I will post a review in a day or two after I can smoke more than one hasty bowl in a blustery cold dog walk. I couldn't help it though. My thoughts on the tin note are three fold. Firstly I love it. Secondly it reminds me very much of Bali Shag rolling tobacco, which I used to love and sorely miss. Thirdly, it makes me feel like this https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=Td2thes1QLg&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUg_iluxQ1IQ%26feature%3Dshare
