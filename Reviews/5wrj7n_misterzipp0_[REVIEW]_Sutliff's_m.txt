Sutliff Ready Rubbed [MATCH]

I'm about a dozen bowls into this blend and I think I finally get it.  I'm a big fan of VaPers and stout Virginias so my first few bowls of this were kind of, shall we say... Wtf? (That stands for where's the flavor, you degenerate!)

I finally loaded this into a brand new uncoated briar (Bones) and it all made sense.  There's a raw woody taste to it that's enhanced by the briar but it's strong in the opening notes of the blend.  I believe the flavoring is molasses/chocolate/cocoa and they are all there but juuuust barely.  They are lightly applied to bring out the natural burley flavors and once I stopped expecting flavors that beat me over the head I began to appreciate the blend more and more.

As the name implies this comes to you in a ready rubbed "nugget" format that kind of looks like grape nuts cereal.  The chunks are pretty thick so it can take a few tries to figure out the pack for this.  It comes a bit moist so microwave or leave out for a while.

My favorite way to enjoy this is during a morning drive with a cup of coffee from an insulated cup so it stays nice and warm.  Something about the earthy taste from the coffee really amplifies the earthy taste that is present in this burley blend.  As of late I've started packing a very small layer of Missouri Meerschaum's Country Gentleman (surprise! A VaPer) into the bottom of the bowl.  The purpose of this is twofold; it lets me know when I am getting close to the bottom of the bowl and the blend kind of 'wakes up' about the same time as I do.  

When smoked on its own this will give up all sorts of notes that range from toast to light marshmallow and as it almost goes out it has this amazing roasted coffee bean flavor that's very hard to replicate any other way.  There's notes of drawn butter, maple wood, a light spice, cocoa powder... honestly a ton of light flavors that can be a welcome change to some of the heavier blends I've been smoking.  This reminds me of the first time I had a CAO gold cigar and if the smoke was thicker the two would be pretty comparable.  

What kept me exploring this blend was the fact that it lacked that very sour perfumey taste some burleys give off.  I thought about giving up on burleys until I kept at this blend and I'm glad I didn't!

The nicotine level on this one is pretty light so if you do pair it with coffee you're safe to do so on an empty stomach.  Apparently my nic tolerance is somewhat high so take that for what it's worth.

Colors in this blend are manilla, white, and brown. 

If you're looking for a light breakfast blend or want to venture into the world of burley I would recommend giving this a shot.

As an aside, I never had the original Edgeworth blend that was discontinued several years ago nor have I tried Lane's version of this.


====================================
AughtSeven: Thanks for this. Coincidentally, I was smoking some Pennington Gap last night, and I got to thinking about how I never smoked any traditional cube-cut blends, just PG and Barbary Coast. I may give this or the Lane version (or maybe both) a try. 
--
misterzipp0: I had one bowl of PG and it wasn't what I expected but now I wonder if I judged it unfairly. Are you a fan of it?
--
AughtSeven: It's not a go-to blend for me, but I enjoy the smell a lot, and the novelty of the cube-cut. I like the combination of the burley and perique, which is kind of unusual. I think it smokes really well just dropped (not packed) in a fresh cob.

bger1111: How have you trained your taste buds to be so acute
--
misterzipp0: I was gifted with several strong senses: smell, taste, and memory.

My mother will tell you that as a child I always had dirt rings around my nostrils because I was constantly smelling my fingers after they would touch something.  Even as an adult I smell things way too often, although I try to be a little more discreet lest I look like Molly Shannon! http://tinylink.net/ALDGn

Seriously though, a big part of describing tastes and smells is being able to identify (from memory) the taste/smell you're experiencing with the memory you've associated it with.  Take the note "baking spices" for example.  Right now think about walking into a kitchen around the holidays.  What does it smell like? It's usually a melange of cinnamon, nutmeg, bread, brown sugar, etc.  Here's an easier one. What does hay smell like?  Now go smoke a straight Virginia blend and tell me it doesn't taste like how hay smells!  From there you can pick out other scents as they come though.

If you can remember smells like you can recall a memory I think you'll have an easier time identifying the flavors in a blend, at least that's how it works for me.

bger1111: Awesome advice I'll try that!
