First off, that I'm writing this at all---nothing has budged me from a steady diet of Kendal Kentucky, Kendal Dark, and Dark Flake for a decade---is ridiculous.

That there was any chance in Hell that I might like something lighter in flavor and body was somewhere between zero and none. I like muscular cigars, Kurdish coffee, and deadly hot sauce.

I did end up giving it a go, though, because I knew how long and insanely hard Greg Pease worked on it, and thought NOT doing so could be viewed as disrespectful, somehow (I'm seriously Old School about stuff like that).

And now, at this very second as I type, gigantic B-52-sized pigs are flying in formation over every square mile of the Earth's surface... because, no shit, I-am-absolutely-not-joking, it is GOOD.

I mean G O O D good. Absolutely unreal. The overall essence is faintly-but-distinctly Graham cracker-y, with a vanilla thread running through it, and everything else is pure, clean, no-nonsense tobacco flavor.

I am stunned. It is absolutely lovely. Perfectly balanced. Burns effortlessly. Easy to light, zero prep. Just fill and go. It's as if my all-time favorite Kendal Kentucky was dialed back by half and set into a picture frame of Graham cracker and vanilla.

Damn.

Oh yeah. No stickiness whatsoever, so outward indication of any kind that it has been flavor enhanced.

I've run out of words. I'm literally just sitting here shaking my head. I knew Greg was one of the top blenders in the world, I had no idea he was a genius effing magician.

This is crazy.

Ciceronian: Super stoked for this. Also predicting it'll be impossible to gauge anything on this from reviews; people will largely either be overselling it because it's an aromatic from GLP, or trashing it because it's an aromatic from GLP. It's going to be like the Achtung, Baby of blends; people won't review it with objectivity because they'll be so caught up in the "departure" element. 
--
Comintern: I don't think it will be that crazy. This isn't the first time he's moved in this direction. He's got a ton of crossover Aro blends like Haddo's Delight, Sextant, Sixpence, Barbary Coast. So going full aro shouldn't really surprise anyone.
--
Pipezilla: But this is his first full aro and some people might think he's going in the wrong direction.

pylorns: Getting a little chub here waiting for this.

Pipezilla: I'm so stoked about this tobacco!!!  Just the write up in SP had my mouth watering!!!!  Im gonna call my 2 tobacco shops in San Jose and see if they have it or when they expect to have it in stock.  I know I will pay about 18 a tin, but u don't care!!!!  This tobacco sounds so amazing...
--
Pipezilla: Just called one of the shops and she said, "I don't carry any of his tobacco (GL Pease) because I can't import them in". Huh???  He's not out of the country???  Oh well, I'm calling the next shop.
--
Pipezilla: And the 2nd shop said their waiting for samples before they buy any.  So it looks like I have to place a order.
