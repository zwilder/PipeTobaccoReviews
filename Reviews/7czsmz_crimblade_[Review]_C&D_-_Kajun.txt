[Review] C&D - Kajun Kake
By: crimblade
---
**Blend Name:** Kajun Kake

**Description on Tin:** We start with naturally sweet red Virginias and add just the right touch of everyone's favorite Cajun spice, Louisiana Perique. Then we press it into an old fashioned crumble cake which deepens and marries the flavors into what is quickly becoming one of C&D's most popular blends ever!

**Leaf:** Cavendish, Perique, Virginia. A dark black brick, it doesn't crumble easily but slicing produces wonderful flakes that can easily be rubbed out.

**Tin Aroma:** Dark Earth, a hint of sweetness.

**Taste:** Again slightly sweet dark earth. It is creamy and soft with no hint of spice or fruit that I tend to expect from perique blends. Nothing but wonderful earth with the occasional sourness that builds somewhat the farther down the bowl you get. At times the smoke can take on a slightly oily flavor but nothing that is off putting. 

**Smokability:** Perfect moisture right out of the tin, no drying necessary what-so-ever. Preparation is very easy as it slices well and then crumbles into a nice cube cut. Packing is only ever troublesome if you get smaller bits on the bottom causing you to take a shot of tobacco on the first few puffs. It lights rather hesitantly often needing several charring lights before it catches the flame. Once it does catch the flame it doesn't easily let it go and hardly, if ever, requires a relight. It can get a bit tongue burny but with gentle sips it smokes beautifully. 

**Room Note:** Sweet smoke layered in earth. 

**Thoughts:** I initially got this tin as part of a C&D sampler pack that was offered by SmokingPipes.com, I believe it was the last of such packs as after I ordered it it was no longer available. I checked because when I received it all the tins in the sampler had 2+ years of age on them already. Following up on this I don't know what Kajun Kake is like without a couple years on it, but I can tell you that with those years it is a delight. Unfortunately Kajun Kake is one of those blends that has gotten a bit of a reputation for having mold straight out of the tin which is exactly why I popped it soon after receiving it. There was no mold and I'm pretty thankful for that because I would have missed out on something very tasty. It took a couple smokes for me to really appreciate Kajun Kake, as mentioned before it can be slightly problematic to get lit and if puffed too fast tends to bite and lose a good amount of delicious flavors. Once I got the cadence and light figured out this blend became a blend to enjoy on the occasional evening. I avoid smoking it too often as I don't want it to run out before I'm able to get one of my stock piled tins to a minimum of 2 years aging. I am tempted to try it when it's young but my curiosity has not yet been able to overcome my desire to have more of it aged. Lastly, it packs a good amount of nicotine so don't smoke on an empty stomach. 

**Recommend to:** Pipers who enjoy a well aged Virginia, those who are looking for the earthy smoke of a cigar in a pipe tobacco.

**Summary:** Patience is well rewarded by the Kajun Kake

**Drink Pairings:**  Milk, nothing else makes the dark earth flavor pop like it does. 

**Final Rating:** 4/4 (With 2+ years on it, with a younger tin your results may vary.)

**My Background:** I've been a pipe smoker for 4 years. My current favorites are Sixpence, Acadian Perique, Mountain Camp, Quiet Nights, and Dark Plug.
====================================
crimblade: *Disclaimer:* Nothing to disclaim this blend is a treat and I'm thankful for /u/antiwittgenstein giving me a reason to smoke it a few more times than I would have otherwise in order to finish reviewing it.

====================================
antiwittgenstein: Sounds like my kinda thing. I am beginning to suspect this onslaught of reviews might end being very deleterious to my TAD.
--
crimblade: This sub in general is pretty bad for my TAD, nice use of deleterious!

====================================
Hawky454: Sounds awesome man! I have a tin of it with just over two years in my cellar. I’ll probably pop it at the 5 year mark.

====================================
adamdenton1: Nice review. Almost grabbed some on my last order, next round for sure.

====================================
jmsmitty6: Good review and spot on with the taste. I'm currently smoking a tin w/5 years age. It's fantastic

====================================
boomer56: Milk!? I have never paired a tobacco with milk. Especially since /u/soymilkisgood converted me to bean juice with his relentless propaganda. I guess I'm gonna have to try that, for science and all. But I can seem to imagine it tasting good. 
--
SupraMario: It's one of the best pairings out there. I got a bunch of the Cigars guys on it, and seems like it has migrated over here lol. Whole white milk is perfect to bring out the flavors in tobacco.

--
soymilkisgood: Maybe it has something to do with neutralizing and soothing the palate, allowing the taste buds to taste more. I’m just making this up, but it sounds plausible enough to be true. To me anyway. 
--
SupraMario: This is what I've always assumed, as milk is pretty damn neutral flavor
