Review on the Colibri Pacific Pipe Lighter

I've only been smoking a pipe for a month or so, but I've always liked a good lighter.  I received the lighter yesterday and had a full day to smoke a few bowls with it.  It sucked.  I wanted to post my Amazon.com review here in case it helps anyone in choosing an awesome lighter.

>Edit: It rattles when you shake it. That was the first test I put this thing through and it passed with flying colors. After one evening of light use, the base where the tamper is attached rattles. There seems to be some loose magnetic component inside the base that attaches to the tamper when it's in place, but when you take the tamper out it rattles like crazy. Putting the tamper back in fixed the rattling the first dozen or so times, but now the base section rattles lightly with the tamper in or out.

>I wish I could give this thing two different star ratings. One for just being a lighter, and the other for in comparison to the Zippo pipe lighter. So I will.

>Pipe lighter review - 4 stars:

>Because of the ninety degree angle, you can easily run this around the inner rim of a tobacco pipe precise enough to never touch the briar, but get the tobacco lit all the way to the edge. The Zippo pipe lighter works fine, but it took a lot of practice to keep the flame from kissing the edge of the bowl because it obstructs your view of what part of the bowl is actually being lit. With this lighter you can run it right along the bowl and you can perfectly see the edge of the flame.

>The built in tamper is awesome. That was a feature I thought was a little gimmicky when I bought it, but I ended up loving it. I already have a really nice multi-tool tamper, but now that's just for home.

>As for this being a $50 lighter - 2 stars:

>The first thing I noticed was an issue I that I had read about in the reviews before I bought it and hoped I would just get lucky. I didn't get lucky. The flame adjustment knob works fine at 100%, and down to about 75% too. Past that, the flame won't light consistently, if ever. It just makes a puff and goes out, unless you depress the button really fast, and even then it almost never lights. That's my biggest gripe; it sucks that this thing has a desirable setting that simply doesn't work.

>Secondly, the actuator button feels a little cheap for $50. At least it doesn't rattle when you shake it, which would have warranted a refund in my opinion, but there's a lot of play in that button. If you lightly press on it, it rocks on it's spring, lightly clicking against the sides of the slide. Frankly, that part feels like a cheap piece of s***lighter you'd get a gas station.

>Summary:

>I'm not returning this and I actually enjoy owning it because of how precisely you can light a tobacco pipe with it. I'll go with another brand for my next one though, hoping for a more solid construction feel (probably an IM Corona Old Boy).
====================================
krestelchen: The Old Boy is really georgeous, one of the prettiest little lighters in that price range in my opinion. That alone would have warranted the buying of an Old Boy over the Pacific any day of the week, even if it is a bit more pricey.

====================================
carnesy: On the other side of the colibri spectrum I have a now DC'ed Barrington lighter that has lasted me for 3-4 years now and is still going strong. Best lighter I've ever owned, better than the corona old boy I got last year.
