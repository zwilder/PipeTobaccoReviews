[Tobacco Review] McCelland's Premium Aromatic: Pal o' Mine
By: ejkhabibi
---
This is my first review attempt so constructive criticism and advice is welcomed.


Blend Name: Pal o' Mine


Description on Tin: "Quiet, soothing, always agreeable, the pipe is a fine companion when filled with this ever-civil, mellow blend. The subtle fragrance is vaguely reminiscent of Grandma's peach cobbler


Leaf: Short ribbons. Medium brown overall, with some variation.
Tin Aroma: Overwhelmingly strong peach scent. More like of hookah tobacco. 


Taste: Out of the gate it was in-your-face peach. No tobacco taste, just peach. The flavor stayed real strong and apparent throughout the bowl. Very cool smoke, no tounge bite possible. Burns consistently. More subtle notes of vanilla and cream. Flavours mellow out as tin sits out. 


Smokability: A great desert smoke, as it was cool and very easy to smoke. Stays lit rather well, and had the right moisture out of the tin. Smokes cool.


Room Note: Some said that it is almost too peachy, and almost lacks any tobacco scent. Not the best "pipe" scent, but great if your around nonsmokers. 


Thoughts: I wanted to find an aromatic that was literally straight sugar. This was what my research led me to. Ive never smoked anything with so much flavor and personality. There is nothing subtle about this blend, despite what the tin said. I really enjoyed it after dinner as a little desert, or in the morning when I don't want something too strong. My first bowl, I was so pleased I literally could not smoke it fast enough. That said, as the novelty wore off, its becoming something more of the rotation than the sole tobacco I was smoking. Honestly, its probably the best aromatic I've ever had as far as quality, but sometimes I want something more mellow. 


Summary: A high quality, in-your-face aromatic blend that will give flavors closer to that of a hookah than a pipe tobacco. Awesome if you have a peach fetish or a sweet tooth like myself. It is really unique due to the incredibly bold flavor, so id recommend it.

jelbert6969: Thanks for review. I get on a peach kick sometimes. Found the taste of summer peach underwhelming.

Ok, so what would you recommend as a great Jungle smoke?

ejkhabibi: Haha!

I'd say frog Merton across the pond for jungle settings

JLowU571: Sweet. In all seriousness this sounds like nice Aro. Most of the time the strongly flavoured ones taste awful.
