Tobacco Review: Peterson's Perfect Plug
By: professor_throway

* Blend Name: Peterson's Perfect Plug, 3Ps

* Description on Tin: This excellent plug tobacco comprises selected Virginia leaf from Africa and Brazil blended with Burley leaf from Malawi. The tobaccos are lightly cased before drying and pressing and then are heated and stored for 2 weeks before cutting. The result is a full bodied yet fruity blend, sure to appeal to the experienced pipesmoker.

* Cut: True plug, unlike the G.L. Pease plugs or War Horse which are really more like cakes. This is a dense plug of tobacco. At first glance you might feel cheated by what is in the tin.

* Tin Aroma: Va goodness, deep dark Vas. Light citrus with lots of plum and raisin notes. Sweet topping that I can't quite put my finger on. 

* Taste: Extremely variable. This tobacco is like a chameleon, it changes based on so many variables. Preparation, dry time, bowl shape, relative humidity, drink pairing etc. In general the VAs are what you expect fermented fruits a bit yeasty. The burley components add a nice earthy must. No typical burley nuttiness comes though, it is really more of a body and feel. Slight spice and deep sweetness on the retrohale. Unlike most VAs I found that small sips left it tasting flat and rather pedestrian. Fast puffing turned it ashy with a cigarette taste. If you can find the sweet spot in the middle it just explodes. Lovers of FVF or Blackwoods flake will find a lot they like, even though the flavor isn't really like either of those. I don't get the cigar notes that some other reviews picked up. What I do get is a tangy fermented sweetness, like unsulfured dried apricots that have really really dried out. A strange saltiness sometimes appears sort of like chicken bouillon or mushroom broth, but it is not offensive. When I pick that up it I know I am in the zone. The flavor is pretty monotone through the bowl, a bit sweeter in the beginning and a little tangier at the end. Doesn't get boring. 

* Strength: In between University Flake and Irish Flake. It is not overly strong but the N lets you know it is there. I find it really hits a sweet spot for me. I can smoke it in a reasonable sized bowl without getting wobbly, but I do get the lady N calm and concentration.

* Smokability: I struggled with this for a while before I figured it out. I hated this blend the first half of the tin. It smoked hot and bit like me like a Mac Baren aromatic. After a lot of experiments, what worked for me was to slice it as thin as possible and rub out to a fine shag. Dry it to almost crispy, 15 minutes under an incandescent bulb or 10 seconds in my microwave. (It is deceptively moist, the amount of steam that comes off when you remove it from the microwave was surprising.) Then I ball it up and air pocket it. I tried cube cutting it as well, while the flavor was good and the burn a bit cooler, but it took a ton of relights. I also found I need to tip the ash halfway through or else the ash gets too dense to effectively light and I will be left with a tight bundle of dried, stoved sticks at the bottom of the bowl.  It needs to be lit and relit very gently. Small puffs and remove the flame as soon as it catches. Deep draws on lighting completely kills the flavor and it gets ashy. Works well for me in a billiard 3/4" x 1.5". In a pot it tastes more earthy in a conical bowl a little sweeter but in a medium billiard both sides play together well. 

* Room Note: Only smoke outdoors on deck or in garage with door open. I get citrus in the garage, and my wife doesn't mind being on the deck with me when I smoke it. 

* Thoughts: This tobacco is a huge pain in the ass. It is like my cat. It is finicky. It will piss on your stuff out of pure spite, yet somehow I like having it around. I would feel sad if it ever went away. It is not at all an everyday smoke. I need to be in the mood for it. I am reaching for it more and more though, my Samuel Gawith flakes and VA/Pers are feeling neglected. I have been gravitating towards higher N blends and burleys lately. This provides a nice counterbalance and change of pace.

* Recommend to: Someone who likes strong tobaccos with very full (for VAs) flavors. FVF fans will find a lot to like. N fiends won't feel like they are puffing on hot air. Not recommended for newcomers, the nicotine can be very deceptive and the amount of variables in preparation that need to be managed will make for a very frustrating experience.

* My Background: Cigarette smoke for 20 years. Quit 8 years ago and intermittently smoked a pipe or cigar. In the last year picked up the pipe much more and smoke about 5 bowls a week.
====================================
Zapotecorum: Nice review - I smoke it almost daily now (as a cheaper and more widely available alternative to Salty Dogs) and agree with almost everything you said. I smoke it similarly, sliced very thin and completely rubbed out. except i dont really bother drying it

Also agree 100% that the GLP plugs and War Horse Bars arent really plugs. Too many small bits, too dry, not pressed enough. Not that they aren't good blends though, i still enjoyed em for what they were

givemeyours0ul: 'murricans don't make plugs for some reason. 
--
sonofwang: Does this come in a little plastic wrapper inside the tin the way salty dogs has the extra wrapper?
--
Zapotecorum: Yup
--
sonofwang: Thanks

professor_throway: I am a pretty wet smoker, if I don't dry it I have a swamp in my bowl by the end.

How is Salty Dogs, I keep wanting to try it but really don't want to spend almost $20 online for it. I can get 3Ps for $13 at my local B&M or for under $10 online.
--
Zapotecorum: For me, Salty Dogs is a bit less fruity and has more of a tea-like taste similar to FVF. Has a decent nic hit, about equal to 3Ps. maybe a touch stronger. Same smoking characteristics as 3Ps

Dadgy: Great review, hits most of my notes on this. It's well represented in my cellar.

professor_throway: I almost gave up on it, but it just looked and smelled so good that I had to keep trying till I found that sweet spot.
