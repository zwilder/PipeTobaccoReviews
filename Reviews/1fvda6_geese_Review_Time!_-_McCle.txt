Review Time! - McClelland Tudor Castle
By: geese

I figured it was about time to get back into the review game after taking advantage of a P&C sale on McClelland tins. The first of which is Tudor Castle.

**Description on the Tin:** Ready to smoke and designed to age beautifully, Tudor Castle is a beautifully balanced blend of very sugary bright yellow Virginia, a good amount of rare No. 1 Grade Yenidje, red Virginia and a nice touch of St. James Perique.

**Look of the Leaf in the Tin:** Some smallish dark brown flakes with flecks of yellow and light brown. Nothing too out of the ordinary but pleasing none the less.

**Tin Aroma/Smell:** I was expecting the traditional McClleland vinegar/ketchup so I was sort of offended by the smell of hot vitamins. Upon further inspection this aroma mellowed out but the first opening of the tin belched a rather pungent smell not unlike the vitamin aisle at the grocery store.

**Smokability:** I smoked this blend in a Savinelli pipe which nearly always gurgles and it smoked cool and dry all the way the to bottom using the fold and stuff method of packing. It required 2 relights but offered no tongue bite.

**Room note/Taste/Summary:** Holy shit this is good! I was skeptical after the description on the tin said "beautiful" too many times and mentioned aging since that speaks little of the flavor but this is a fantastic va/per. The room note is nothing like the tin note and smells strongly of virginia tobacco and some sort of herbal smell (maybe sandalwood?).

The flavor changes subtly as you smoke it. I've read that a million times in reviews but this tobacco and Briar Fox are the only blends that have really demonstrated that to me. It alternates between sweet and bright with hints of wood and citrus similar to Orlik Gold, and then dips into a unique and more full flavor like I'm more used to from english blends when french-inhaled, and then finally a sort of cool Virginia Briar Fox wood and earth type flavor. The perique is present but at a low volume, way less prominent than I'm used to from VA/per blends such as Escudo Navy Deluxe. 

I strongly suggest this blend to anyone who likes Virginias and especially anyone who enjoys Cornell and Diehl's Briar Fox as they are similar but I prefer this one. 

I expect the secret ingredient here is the yenidje and would greatly appreciate recommendations for blends containing some. I apparently like it very much.

**Background:** I've been smoking a pipe one or more times a day for just over three years. I try to keep a diverse palette but I tend towards latakia heavy English blends. My favorites are Sam Gawith Skiff, Dunhill Early Morning Pipe, GL Pease Samarra, and recently Frog Morton standard. I've smoked several VA blends including Sam Gawith FVF, C&D Briar Fox, Dunhill Flake, and Escudo Navy Deluxe. 

My last review can be seen in the comments where I laid out the template I'm using now [Peterson Sherlock Holmes](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/pnqc5/on_the_state_of_pipe_tobacco_reviews/).

**TD;DR:** Tudor Castle is a fantastic VA/per blend that is quite unlike any other blends I've tried due to the presence of Yenidje. It is smooth and flavorful with quite a bit more nicotine than I've grown to expect from McCleland.

HellOnAStick: maybe try some yenidje supreme by mcclelland to gain a better idea of that tobacco. http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend_detail.cfm?ALPHA=G&TID=2835
