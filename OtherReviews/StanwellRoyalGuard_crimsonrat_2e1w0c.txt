Stanwell Royal Guard 179 Review
By: crimsonrat

**Brand/History**: Stanwell. Some of the biggest names in Denmark have designed for this company, some history can be found [here](http://pipedia.org/wiki/Stanwell)

**Shape**: 179 Bent Apple designed by the S. Bang guys.

**Purchase Information**: Bought from smokingpipes.com, $100 or so, give or take $10.

**Materials**: Briar and acrylic

**Finish**: Smooth, 1 small fill toward the top of the bowl, but you'd have to be hunting to find it. Stem fits well with a very miniscule light gap on one side. 

**Drilling/Pipe Cleaner Test**: drilling is spot on, fluffy cleaner passes with no ramping and no twisting. Really surprised with it being a fully machine made piece. No whistling noted on inhale or exhale.

**Ergonomics/Weight**: Light weight, 1.5 oz, 5.4 in long, 1.34 deep x .77 wide. Feels good in the hand, great clencher/hanger. Button feels good, bite area is not as thin as I like, but it is very comfortable for a factory made pipe. The shank is actually a rectangle paneled shape, which is different, but it flows into the stem really well.

**Overall**: Would I buy another one? Absolutely. This pipe has never let me down. It will occasionally burn hot, but this is more to do with my vigorous puffing than anything else. For a price point of around $100, this thing is absolutely fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend one to someone else. The shape is easy to hold and the slight bend makes it easy to hang, as well. The finish is darkening slightly over the pipe as I smoke it, giving a nice patina. I have 15 or so Stanwells, and this performs almost as well as my 50 year old pieces.

bob_12: Great review! This makes me realize that I'm missing out by not owning such a well respected pipe brand like Stanwell.

4noggins: Stanwells are very nice pipes. The Royal Guards are particularly sweet. I think Savs, Stanwells, & Petersons are all one needs without spending hundreds of dollars. For the money, you can't beat them.

Enjoy the new pipe.

crimsonrat: That one has actually been around for a while. Out of the 3 you mentioned, the Stanwells always seem to be the best for me personally.

4noggins: Stanwell moved its production to Italy about 3 or 4 years ago. Some problems arose with the early ones, but all the kinks have been worked out and they are doing a fine job now.

crimsonrat: Yeah, not as good as the redg era ones, but still really good for the price new.

dillholio: All the Stanwell 2nd lines from the '60's are cool -- Danske Club, RG, Scandia, etc.  Never had a new one. Probably won't unless they come out with a model 207 in the line.
