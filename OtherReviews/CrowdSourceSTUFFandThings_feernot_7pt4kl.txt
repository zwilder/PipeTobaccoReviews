**[HERE IS THE VIDEO REVIEW!](https://youtu.be/WBYprqfHTL0)**

*Update:  We‚Äôre funded. We have a winner. Tobacco should land on 1/19*

**One of the 8 sponsors will win a tobacco tin from my cellar.** [And the winner is?](https://imgur.com/a/JUD9X) 

The infamously overpriced W.O. Larsen 2015 Hand Pressed limited edition tin just dropped to $240 on P&C ($1,000 MSRP). I‚Äôve reached out to Bradley with STUFFandTHINGS who has agreed to produce an official r/pipetobacco sponsored review for us all to enjoy.

I‚Äôm looking for 8 additional sponsors to pledge $25 a piece to total $200 so we can send it to Bradley. I‚Äôll cover the rest. You‚Äôll each get personalized recognition from him. 

Who wants to make sub history?

[Also, feel free to buy some for yourself. ](https://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/w-o-larsen-2015-hand-pressed-pipe-tobacco/1515301/) Just be sure to use one of the 20% off codes. (REPAY20, FRESH20, or 20START) I‚Äôve got the tin/humidor ordered already. But if we don‚Äôt get sponsors it‚Äôll just sit in my collection never to be touched again.

====================================
trolljoy: As a professional troll and deal recognition expert, I give this a 10/10. You basically get the most watched pipe tobacco review channel on youtube to smoke the most overpriced floral garbage of all time.  The "YTPC" is largely an embarassing ensemble of misfits with bad production values. Bradley's channel is tops because... the others are sooooooooooo bad.  
  
Anyone who doesn't know why that's funny needs to send me all their tobacco for disposal since lack of humor sours virginias.
--
freepancakesforall: I give this a perfect 5/7. 
--
gentlytamped: "professional troll" smfh thats over 9000 level cringe üòÅ well as a part of the YTPC if you werent trolling i may took that the wrong way, but while its true that there are some channels not worth watching id say "embarassing ensemble of misfits" is a bit harsh generalization.
--
FullFrontalNoodly: Honestly I don't have any problems with either misfits or poor production quality as long as the videos provide good information about pipe tobacco and pipe smoking.  The problem is that most of them don't do that either.
--
3dfx-glide: today i'm smoking my corn cob, threw away the filter of course hahahaha. Check out my smoking garage btw.

so yeah, Prince Albert is good, I like it.

Thanks for watching, see you another time 
--
====================================
benbobhenbob: Ah hell, I'm in. Bradley is a huge reason I even smoke a pipe; semi-supporting his channel and the sub is as good a reason as any to shell out $25 bucks. I'd probably just waste it on booze anyway. I should be able to dig up your paypal info pretty easy, if not you'll hear from me via pm shortly. 
--
====================================
Fuzzy_Totemz: I'm in. But mark it 901stjames.com so his youtube schleps buy my leftover home brews. :-)   
--
feernot: Deal. 
--
Fuzzy_Totemz: Lul.  
  
btw, the perique series starts soon. You need to find some more aftermarket blenders bench though in case they turn out well.  
--
7_stark: Over the line! Mark it zero!
--
====================================
moosecaria: I'd be willing to bet that a bowl of Carter Hall is a better smoke. Alas, I do not have the money to donate. I'll be looking forward to Bradley's review!
--
feernot: I think u/freepancakesforall is the only guy I know with some currently in his possession. He should be giving us his own impressions sometime soon. 
--
7_stark: I took the plunge and bought a box for myself. What the hell, right? At $240 I figured I‚Äôm basically paying for some strong lulz and a tiny unicorn humidor. Never would have touched this at $1,000, though. I have no idea who did or would have.

As for the tobacco itself, who the hell knows. I just hope it hasn‚Äôt dried out over the years it spent in storage. Larsen tins are usually non-airtight, and their tobaccos dry quickly if not taken out of their plastic bags and jarred straight away. Whatever humidification device they used here probably would not have held up over a two to three year period.
--
feernot: ROFL. Unicorn indeed. Only 200 of those shitty boxes in existence. 
--
feernot: I also read that evidently only 40 were sent to the US. 
--
7_stark: I feel special already! The conspicuous consumption...it‚Äôs working!

Edit: Getting some rage downvotes already. Look, I‚Äôm not trolling here, and I‚Äôm not trying to throw this in anyone‚Äôs face. I‚Äôm also not going to apologize for my shitty financial decisions. I highly do *not* recommend doing what I am doing. Hate if you want, but I find that pretty uptight.
--
====================================
Pandam: I‚Äôm in!
--
feernot: I sent you a PM with instructions. 
--
Pandam: Sent! 
--
====================================
zero-hunter: Feer, what kind of tobacco tin from your cellar are we talking about here? 

EDIT: I really don't think of this as a joke. I think of it as an affordable way to get an infamously high-priced blend to Bradley, who runs a tight, well-oiled channel, to review. I've been considering sending him some Anni Kake just so he can review it (P&C doesn't ship to WA). Plus, it gives our forum some exposure. I dig it.
--
feernot: Great question! It will certainly be something worth $25 at a minimum. 
--
====================================
stogie-bear: What the heck. I‚Äôll do it. 
--
feernot: Good man. 
--
====================================
freepancakesforall: Lol. I thought you were crowdsourcing to group buy. So we‚Äôre paying to watch Bradley smoke it?    

I‚Äôll smoke my sample on-camera for $140.    

(Joking)
--
feernot: We can‚Äôt all smoke it. This is just a fun idea I had, plus a contest to win one of my tins, too. At $240 it‚Äôs still a high price to split 3.5 ounces between a few peeps. Plus, this gives the sub some promotion for being the best pipe tobacco community. 
--
freepancakesforall: I get it. But... if it was split it into 7 samples of .5 oz, that would be ~$34 per person.    

So $25 to just watch, $34 to try several bowls.     

You all have some disposable income! Winning a free tin is cool though. 


--
feernot: Then buy up a tin and get a split going!
--
freepancakesforall: Lol. So 3.5 oz of stale aromatic or 3 pounds of 5100. Hmmm.
--
feernot: Touch√©
--
freepancakesforall: I do love Larsen though and am stoked to try this. 
--
====================================
PeskyPrussian: Fair enough if you want to try, but I'm going to say no. 

1. I'd rather Bradley spend his time on reviews which will be actually useful to the pipe community.

2. Actually purchasing blends like this will only encourage blenders to pull this type of thing in the future.

3. This is an aromatic blend, which Bradley is almost certainly going to dislike anyway.

It would be a decent chunk of change to toss away simply to have a video to perpetuate the circlejerk.

--
feernot: Thanks for your opinion. We discourage groupthink on this sub.
--
trolljoy: dude, there are only so many blends out there. "here's another english... it tastes like... english... so yeah, how bout them seahawks".   
  
It's not just that we're forcing him to smoke a 1000 dollar MSRP Danish equivalent of a Lakeland (gale essence, gag), it's us driving it.  
  
He can't say no, because it will set his channel apart.  He's caught between pretentious danish floral crap and monetization.  
  
This is almost evil what we're doing.  
  
Except me, because I don't donate to anything. 
--
FullFrontalNoodly: I believe the goal here is to have a reputable reviewer provide an honest review.  That is likely the best way to end the circlejerk.

However, I do agree that if this is indeed an aromatic tobacco Bradley is probably not the best choice to review it.  Perhaps OP could have Bradley send off the remainder to other reviewers he trusts that do like aromatics for their reviews as well.
--
====================================
carnesy: Fuck it I'll pitch $25 in for "the LoLz" PM me the Paypal info
--
====================================
SupraMario: I'd rather see reviewers find and smoke super old blends.

I like the box on this one lol
--
====================================
7_stark: I‚Äôll do it. It‚Äôs a worthy cause. Sign me up.

Bradley‚Äôs channel is top notch. One of the only pipe tobacco reviewers I watch very regularly. And I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve always been a wee bit curious what a $1,000 aromatic is all about. The unboxing alone should be great.
--
====================================
linearone: I tried to do a group buy with this last year
--
givemeyours0ul: At this price I'm in on a group buy.
--
feernot: How much was it going for then?
--
linearone: Wasnt it 500?
--
====================================
toxickDonkey: In for $25
--
====================================
mgvsquared: I‚Äôd be in for it too...looks like you got your 8 though! Awesome!
--
feernot: We‚Äôve still got one guy pending. It may or not fall through. You can be the backup if that happens. 
--
mgvsquared: Sounds good. Keep me posted! :)
--
====================================
HavelDad: This community is so awesome 
--
====================================
burks21: This is an awesome idea. Can't wait for the video. 

While it might be a video that has little usefulness, it will be entertaining. It's like watching a video on a $250+ cigar. I'm never going to smoke one.....but I want to know if it sucks or not. 
--
carnesy: Like [THIS ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlOg9a9Gbmw)?
--
burks21: Bingo. He's got a couple more that are $100+
--
====================================
pylorns: Love it.
--
====================================
3dfx-glide: fun idea
--
====================================
mymiataisgay4U: How do i get my name on this list?
--
feernot: We just needed 8 donors to make this happen. 
--
mymiataisgay4U: Sounds like you got them. Great Job!
